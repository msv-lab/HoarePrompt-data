Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 500, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `nums`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
