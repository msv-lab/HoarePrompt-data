Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value entered by the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
