Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 500\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `nums`. The variables `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
