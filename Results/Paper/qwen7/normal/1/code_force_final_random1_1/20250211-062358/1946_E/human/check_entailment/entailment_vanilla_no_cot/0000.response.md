Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code includes two functions `func_1` and `func_2`, but these functions do not seem to be directly related to solving the problem described. The problem requires determining the number of permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums, which involves combinatorial logic rather than the modular multiplicative inverse operations suggested by the functions.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to implement logic that takes into account the constraints of prefix and suffix maximums and calculates the number of valid permutations accordingly. The given functions do not contribute to solving the problem as stated.
