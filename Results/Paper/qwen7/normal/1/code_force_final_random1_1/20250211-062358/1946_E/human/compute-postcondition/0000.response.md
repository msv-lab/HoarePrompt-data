Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a tuple containing two integers where the second integer is 1000000007, `c` is an integer, and `d` is an integer returned by the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**.

This means that the variable `a` remains unchanged as an integer, `b` remains a tuple with the second element being 1000000007, and `c` and `d` are the results of the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, which returns a tuple of two integers.
