a is a list of three integers representing the length of the permutation (n), the number of prefix maximums (m_1), and the number of suffix maximums (m_2), where 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. b is a list containing two lists: the first list contains m_1 integers (p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1}) representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, and the second list contains m_2 integers (s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2}) representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order.
