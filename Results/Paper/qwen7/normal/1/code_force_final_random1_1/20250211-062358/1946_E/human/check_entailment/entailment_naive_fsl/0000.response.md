Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be directly related to solving the problem described. The problem requires counting the number of permutations that match given prefix and suffix maximum constraints. However, the provided functions appear to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used for finding the greatest common divisor and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. This algorithm is not relevant to solving the permutation problem described.

To solve the given problem, we would need to implement a logic that constructs permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximum constraints. The provided functions do not contribute to this solution and thus the program is incorrect.
