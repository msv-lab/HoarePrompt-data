### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to count the number of permutations of length \( n \) that satisfy given prefix and suffix maximum constraints.
   - The constraints are provided as indices of prefix and suffix maximums.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the multiplicative inverse of a number under modular arithmetic. This function is not directly related to constructing or counting permutations.
   - **Function `func_2`**: Uses the result of `func_1` to compute a modular multiplication. Again, this function is not related to the problem of counting permutations.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code initializes a list `facts` to store factorials up to 200,000, which is unnecessary for the problem since the constraints are much smaller.
   - The main logic of the code iterates over the prefix and suffix maximums and uses the `func_2` function, which is not relevant to the problem. The logic to construct or count permutations is missing.

4. **Relevance of Functions**:
   - The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is not applicable to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximum constraints.
   - The code does not implement any logic to generate or count permutations that meet the given constraints.

Since the provided functions and the overall logic of the code do not address the problem requirements, the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to count permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximum constraints.
