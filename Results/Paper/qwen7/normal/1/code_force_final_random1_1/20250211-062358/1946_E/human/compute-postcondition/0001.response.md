Output State: **The program returns the value of c multiplied by a, modulo 1000000007.**

Given the initial state:
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is a tuple containing two integers, with the second integer being 1000000007.
- `c` is an integer.
- `d` is an integer returned by the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.

The code snippet does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `c`. Instead, it returns the expression `c * a % 1000000007`. Since `1000000007` is the second element of the tuple `b`, and `d` is calculated from `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, these details are not directly relevant to the return statement.

Therefore, the final output is the value of `c` multiplied by `a`, and then taken modulo `1000000007`.
