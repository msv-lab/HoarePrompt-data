### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to solving the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. These functions deal with modular arithmetic and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which are not directly applicable to the combinatorial problem at hand.

However, the annotated code provides a detailed breakdown of the logic used in the program. Let's verify the correctness of the annotated code step-by-step:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The code initializes a list `facts` to store factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It also reads the indices of the prefix maximums `p` and the suffix maximums `s`.

2. **Validation of Input Constraints**:
   - The code checks if the last index of prefix maximums matches the first index of suffix maximums, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutations exist.

3. **Combinatorial Counting**:
   - The code iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods.
   - For each segment between two consecutive suffix maximums, it computes the number of ways to arrange the elements within that segment.
   - Similarly, it handles the prefix maximums in reverse order.
   - Finally, it multiplies the results of these calculations to get the total number of valid permutations.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The code uses the `func_2` function to handle modular arithmetic efficiently.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Segment Calculation**:
  - The code correctly identifies segments between consecutive suffix maximums and calculates the number of valid permutations for each segment.
  - It uses the factorial values stored in `facts` to compute combinations and permutations.
  - The logic for handling prefix maximums in reverse order is also correct.

- **Modulo Operation**:
  - The use of `func_2` ensures that intermediate results are kept within the bounds of \(10^9 + 7\) to avoid overflow.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles edge cases where the input constraints are violated, returning 0 as expected.

### Conclusion:

After carefully analyzing the annotated code and verifying each step, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the given functions were not relevant, but the actual implementation in the annotated code is correct.

**Final: True**
