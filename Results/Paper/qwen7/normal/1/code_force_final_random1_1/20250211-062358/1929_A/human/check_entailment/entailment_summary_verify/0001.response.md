Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program sorts the array and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which indeed gives the maximum possible beauty of the array. However, let's verify this step-by-step using the function summary and the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements: \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

### Function Summary Recap
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case:
1. It reads the length of the array `n`.
2. It reads the array `a` and sorts it.
3. It prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array.

### Detailed Verification
1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are at the ends of the array. For the beauty calculation, we need to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements. By sorting the array, we ensure that the largest element is paired with the smallest element, which is the optimal way to maximize the differences.

2. **Difference Calculation**: The difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sorted array is the same as the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array. When the array is sorted, the first element is the smallest and the last element is the largest. Therefore, the difference between these two elements is the maximum possible difference for any pair of consecutive elements in the array.

3. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - **Test Case 1**: 
     - Input: `2 1 3`
     - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
     - Maximum beauty: \(3 - 1 = 2\)
   - **Test Case 2**: 
     - Input: `69 69 69`
     - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
     - Maximum beauty: \(69 - 69 = 0\)
   - **Test Case 3**: 
     - Input: `100 54 80 43 90`
     - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
     - Maximum beauty: \(100 - 43 = 57\)
   - **Test Case 4**: 
     - Input: `3 4 3 3`
     - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
     - Maximum beauty: \(4 - 3 = 1\)
   - **Test Case 5**: 
     - Input: `2 1`
     - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
     - Maximum beauty: \(2 - 1 = 1\)

The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array and finding the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

Final: **True**
