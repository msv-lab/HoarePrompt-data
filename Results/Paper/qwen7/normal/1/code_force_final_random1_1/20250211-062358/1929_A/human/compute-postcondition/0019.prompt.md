You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `ntest` must be a positive integer, `itest` will be equal to `ntest - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. For each iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of sorted integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The final output of the program will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of each list `a` for all iterations.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, the program will have processed all test cases provided by the value of `ntest`, and for each test case, it will have printed the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, and for each test case, n is an integer between 2 and 100, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n each between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a result based on the processed input data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
