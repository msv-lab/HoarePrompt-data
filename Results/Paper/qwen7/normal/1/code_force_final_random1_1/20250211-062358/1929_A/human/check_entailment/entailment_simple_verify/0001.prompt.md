You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `ntest` must be a positive integer, `itest` will be equal to `ntest - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. For each iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of sorted integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The final output of the program will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of each list `a` for all iterations.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, the program will have processed all test cases provided by the value of `ntest`, and for each test case, it will have printed the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the list `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements: \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

### Given Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case as follows:

1. It reads the length of the array `n`.
2. It reads the array `a` and sorts it.
3. It prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array.

### Reasoning
1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are at the ends of the array.
2. **Difference Calculation**: The maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted because the difference between the largest and smallest elements (after sorting) will be maximized for the first and last elements, and this pattern will hold for the differences between consecutive elements.

### Example Walkthrough
Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Test Case 1
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  2 1 3
  ```
- After sorting: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Maximum beauty: \(3 - 1 = 2\)

#### Test Case 2
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  69 69 69
  ```
- After sorting: `[69, 69, 69]`
- Maximum beauty: \(69 - 69 = 0\)

#### Test Case 3
- Input: 
  ```
  5
  100 54 80 43 90
  ```
- After sorting: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
- Maximum beauty: \(100 - 43 = 57\)

#### Test Case 4
- Input: 
  ```
  4
  3 4 3 3
  ```
- After sorting: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
- Maximum beauty: \(4 - 3 = 1\)

#### Test Case 5
- Input: 
  ```
  2
  2 1
  ```
- After sorting: `[1, 2]`
- Maximum beauty: \(2 - 1 = 1\)

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and finding the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
