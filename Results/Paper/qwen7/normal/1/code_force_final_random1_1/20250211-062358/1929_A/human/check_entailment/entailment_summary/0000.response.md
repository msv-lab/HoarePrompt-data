Reasoning:
The given program aims to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

The program correctly processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of elements \(n\) and the list of elements \(a\). It then sorts the list \(a\) and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted list. This difference represents the maximum possible beauty of the array because:

- When the array is sorted, the largest difference between consecutive elements will be between the smallest and largest elements.
- By placing the smallest element at the start and the largest at the end, and arranging the rest in between, we maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

Correctness: **True**
