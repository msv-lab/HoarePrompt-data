### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).
   - To maximize this sum, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest element is paired with the next smallest, and so on, which helps in maximizing the sum of the differences.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - Finally, it prints the difference between the last and the first element of the sorted array, i.e., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - When the array is sorted, the maximum difference between consecutive elements will be between the largest and the smallest elements.
   - This approach ensures that the sum of differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i = 2\) to \(n\) is maximized because the smallest possible negative differences are minimized and the largest possible positive differences are maximized.
   - Therefore, the program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and then finding the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

**Correctness: True**
