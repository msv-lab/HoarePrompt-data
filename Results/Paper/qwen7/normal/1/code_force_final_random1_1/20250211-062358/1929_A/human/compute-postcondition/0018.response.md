Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, and for each test case, n is an integer between 2 and 100, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n each between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a result based on the processed input data.**

This means the function does not take any parameters itself but rather processes input data according to the specified constraints and returns a result based on that input.
