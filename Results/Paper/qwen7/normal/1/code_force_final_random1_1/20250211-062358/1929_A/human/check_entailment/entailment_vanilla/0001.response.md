Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements: \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

### Given Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case as follows:

1. It reads the length of the array `n`.
2. It reads the array `a` and sorts it.
3. It prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array.

### Reasoning
1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are at the ends of the array.
2. **Difference Calculation**: The maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted because the difference between the largest and smallest elements (after sorting) will be maximized for the first and last elements, and this pattern will hold for the differences between consecutive elements.

### Example Walkthrough
Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Test Case 1
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  2 1 3
  ```
- After sorting: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Maximum beauty: \(3 - 1 = 2\)

#### Test Case 2
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  69 69 69
  ```
- After sorting: `[69, 69, 69]`
- Maximum beauty: \(69 - 69 = 0\)

#### Test Case 3
- Input: 
  ```
  5
  100 54 80 43 90
  ```
- After sorting: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
- Maximum beauty: \(100 - 43 = 57\)

#### Test Case 4
- Input: 
  ```
  4
  3 4 3 3
  ```
- After sorting: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
- Maximum beauty: \(4 - 3 = 1\)

#### Test Case 5
- Input: 
  ```
  2
  2 1
  ```
- After sorting: `[1, 2]`
- Maximum beauty: \(2 - 1 = 1\)

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and finding the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
