### Reasoning:

The original assessment provided a detailed breakdown of the program and correctly identified the key components and their roles. Let's re-examine the program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Base Cases and Recurrence Relation:**
   - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct.
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is designed to count the number of ways to place rooks on an \(i \times i\) board such that no two rooks attack each other. This recurrence relation is derived from combinatorial principles and is correct.

2. **Tracking Invalid Positions:**
   - The program correctly tracks invalid positions using a set `invalid`. This ensures that no two rooks can be placed in the same row or column.
   - The number of valid positions left on the board is calculated as `n - len(invalid)`.

3. **Final Configuration Count Calculation:**
   - The result is computed using the DP array: `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`. This ensures that the result is at least 1, even if no valid positions remain.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation `% 1000000007` is correctly applied to handle large numbers, ensuring the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the detailed analysis and the function summary, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid final configurations after the given moves. The base cases and recurrence relation are appropriate, and the handling of invalid positions is sound.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
