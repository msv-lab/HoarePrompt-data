Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The function `func_1` correctly initializes the base cases for the dynamic programming array `dp`:
   - `dp[1] = 1`
   - `dp[2] = 3`

2. **Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation used in the loop is correct:
   - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`
   This relation ensures that the values are computed correctly for each `i` from 3 to `n`.

3. **Set of Invalid Positions**: The code correctly identifies the positions that are already occupied by rooks (`invalid` set) and subtracts the count of these positions from `n` to get the number of available positions for placing additional rooks.

4. **Final Calculation**: The final result is calculated using `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`, which ensures that the result is at least 1, even if all positions are invalid.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation (`% 1000000007`) is applied correctly to handle large numbers, ensuring the result fits within the required constraints.

Given that the logic follows the problem statement accurately and the implementation details match the expected behavior, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
