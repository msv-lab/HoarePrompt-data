Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, where each move consists of placing a rook in a valid position and the computer mirroring the move.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The solution uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations. The key observation is that after \(k\) moves, the remaining positions form a bipartite graph where the rows and columns are split into two sets, and no two rooks can be in the same row or column.

3. **DP Array Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of ways to place rooks in a bipartite graph of size \(i\). This is done using the recurrence relation:
   \[
   dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
   \]
   with initial conditions \(dp[1] = 1\) and \(dp[2] = 3\).

4. **Input Processing**: For each test case, the program reads the dimensions \(n\) and \(k\), and the coordinates of the previous \(k\) moves. It then calculates the number of valid configurations for the remaining board using the precomputed DP array.

5. **Set of Invalid Positions**: The program maintains a set of invalid positions (rows and columns where rooks are placed) and uses the length of this set to index into the DP array. The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \max(1, dp[n - \text{len}(invalid)])
   \]
   This ensures that even if all rows and columns are used, there is still at least one valid configuration (an empty board).

6. **Modulo Operation**: The results are taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The DP array is correctly initialized and updated, and the final configurations are correctly counted using the precomputed values.

Correctness: **True**
