Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, the coordinates (r_i, c_i) for each move you made are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and no two rooks share the same row or column after each move and its mirrored move by the computer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 4

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[5]` is 29, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\), `i` is 5

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `dp[6]` is 17, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[5]` is 29, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n \geq 6\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\), `i` is 7.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
