Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard. Here are the detailed reasons why:

1. **Set Usage**: The `invalid` set stores the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. However, the calculation of the number of valid positions for placing rooks is incorrect. The line `print(max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)]))` assumes that the number of valid positions is simply `n - len(invalid)`, which is not accurate. This assumption fails to consider the specific constraints of the problem, particularly the mirrored placements.

2. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: The `dp` array is used to store the number of ways to place rooks in a smaller board. However, the formula used in `func_1` does not account for the specific constraints of the problem (i.e., the positions that are already invalid). The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is not relevant to the current problem context.

3. **Incorrect Configuration Counting**: The program does not correctly handle the mirrored placements and the constraints of the problem. For example, if a rook is placed at `(r, c)` and the computer mirrors it to `(c, r)`, the program does not adjust the `invalid` set correctly to reflect this mirrored placement. This leads to an incorrect count of valid configurations.

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
