Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program sets a recursion limit and initializes a DP array `dp` to store intermediate results.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.

2. **Tracking Invalid Positions:**
   - A set `invalid` is used to keep track of positions where rooks cannot be placed due to existing rooks.
   - For each of the `k` moves, the program adds the row and column indices to the `invalid` set.

3. **DP Array Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates values for the DP array `dp` up to a maximum value (300000).
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For larger values, the recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.

4. **Final Configuration Count Calculation:**
   - The number of valid positions left on the board is `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The result is computed using the DP array: `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Base Cases and Recurrence Relation:**
   - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct.
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` seems to follow the combinatorial logic for counting configurations, but let's verify it:
     - For `i = 3`, `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * 2 * dp[1]) % 1000000007 = (3 + 8) % 1000000007 = 11`.
     - This matches the expected number of configurations for a 3x3 board without any restrictions.

2. **Handling Invalid Positions:**
   - The program correctly tracks invalid positions and uses them to compute the number of valid configurations.
   - The use of `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` ensures that the result is at least 1, even if no valid positions remain.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation `% 1000000007` is correctly applied to handle large numbers, ensuring the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid final configurations after the given moves. The base cases and recurrence relation are appropriate, and the handling of invalid positions is sound.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
