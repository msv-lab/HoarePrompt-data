Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`, and `3` (the starting value of the range).

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `dp[1]` is 1
   - `dp[2]` is 3
   - `dp[3]` is 5
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\)
   - `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\)
   - `i` is 4

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from `i = 3` and goes up to `n`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**: Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The new value of `i` will be 5.

5. **Verify the other loop head variables**: The other loop head variables (`n` and `3`) remain unchanged.

6. **Construct the new state**: The new state should reflect the updated value of `i` and maintain the original values of `n`, `t`, `dp`, and `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\), `i` is 5**
