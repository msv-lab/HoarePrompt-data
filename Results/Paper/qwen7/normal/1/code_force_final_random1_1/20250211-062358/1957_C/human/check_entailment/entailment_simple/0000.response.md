Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves placing rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. The rooks are placed in turns, with the computer mirroring your moves. The goal is to calculate the number of different final configurations possible after \(k\) moves, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The sequence of valid configurations follows a specific pattern based on the number of unoccupied rows and columns.
   - The dynamic programming approach used in the `func_1` function calculates the number of ways to place rooks on an \(n \times n\) board without any two rooks attacking each other, considering the constraints of the problem.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized to store the number of configurations for boards of sizes from 1 to \(3 \times 10^5\).
   - The recurrence relation used in the loop correctly models the problem's constraints and ensures that the configurations are counted accurately.

4. **Function Execution**:
   - The `func_1` function precomputes the values for the `dp` array, which is used to quickly determine the number of configurations for any board size up to \(3 \times 10^5\).
   - The main part of the program reads the test cases and uses the precomputed `dp` values to determine the number of configurations after \(k\) moves.

5. **Handling Invalid Moves**:
   - The program correctly identifies invalid moves (rows and columns that already contain rooks) and adjusts the board size accordingly by subtracting the number of invalid positions from \(n\).

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, ensuring the result fits within standard integer limits.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement. The dynamic programming approach and the handling of invalid moves are implemented accurately.

Correctness: **True**
