Output State: `start` is the length of `nums`; `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 2`, `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - 2`, ..., `nums[start - 2]` is `nums[start - 2] - 2`, `nums[start - 1]` is `nums[start - 1] - 1`; `vis` contains the elements 0 through `start - 2`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list. During each iteration, `start` is incremented unless `nums[start + 1]` is falsy, in which case the loop terminates early. The `vis` set will contain all indices from 0 up to `start - 2` (since `start` ends up being the length of `nums`). Each index `i` in `nums` is decremented multiple times based on how many times `i` was used as `start`. Specifically, `nums[i]` is decremented twice for each occurrence of `i` as `start` until `nums[start + 1]` becomes falsy or all elements are processed.
