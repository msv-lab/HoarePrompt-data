Postcondition: `start` is 3, `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 2`, `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - 2`, `nums[2]` is `nums[2] - 1`, `vis` contains the elements 0, 1, and 2, if `nums[start + 1]` is truthy. Otherwise, `start` is 2, `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 2`, `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - 1`, `nums[2]` is `nums[2] - 1`, `vis` contains the elements 0, 1, and 2.
