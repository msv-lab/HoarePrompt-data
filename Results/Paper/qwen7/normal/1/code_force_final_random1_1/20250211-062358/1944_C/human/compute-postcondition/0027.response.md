Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `start` is 2.
   - `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 2`, but this does not affect the value of `start`.
   - `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - 1`, but this does not affect the value of `start`.
   - `nums[2]` is `nums[2] - 1`, but this does not affect the value of `start`.

2. The `print(start + 1)` statement will execute after these assignments, but since none of these assignments involve `start`, the value of `start` remains unchanged.

3. Therefore, `start` is still 2 when the `print(start + 1)` statement is executed.

4. The expression `start + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1`, which is `3`.

Output: **3**
