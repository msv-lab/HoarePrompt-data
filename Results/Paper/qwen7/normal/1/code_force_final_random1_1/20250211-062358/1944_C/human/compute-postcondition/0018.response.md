Output State: **`start` is 2; `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 2`; `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - 1`; `vis` contains the elements 0 and 1.**

Explanation: The value of `start` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` are not directly modified by the given code, so they retain their previous forms (`nums[0] - 2` and `nums[1] - 1`). The list `vis` remains unchanged, containing the elements 0 and 1.
