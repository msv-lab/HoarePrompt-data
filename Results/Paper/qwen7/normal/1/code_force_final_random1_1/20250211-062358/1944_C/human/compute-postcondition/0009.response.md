Output State: **`start` is 1; `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 1`; `vis` contains the element 0; the current value of `nums[start + 1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `start += 1` increments the value of `start` by 1. Initially, `start` is 0, so after executing the code, `start` becomes 1. The values of `nums[0]`, `vis`, and `nums[start + 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
