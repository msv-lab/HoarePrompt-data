Output State: **`start` is 2; `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 2`; `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - 1`; `nums[2]` is `nums[2] - 1`; `vis` contains the elements 0, 1, and 2.**

Explanation: The code `nums[start] -= 1` decrements the value of `nums[start]` by 1. Given that `start` is 2, `nums[2]` is decremented by 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
