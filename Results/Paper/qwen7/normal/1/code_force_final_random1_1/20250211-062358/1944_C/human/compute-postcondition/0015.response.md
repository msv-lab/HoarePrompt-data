Output State: **`start` is 1; `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 1`; `vis` contains the elements 0 and 1; the current value of `nums[start + 1]` is decreased by 1; `nums[1]` is not zero.**

Explanation: The code `vis.add(start)` adds the value of `start` (which is 1) to the set `vis`. Since `vis` already contained the element 0, after adding `start`, `vis` now contains both 0 and 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
