Output State: **`start` is 2; `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 2`; `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - 2`; `nums[2]` is `nums[2] - 1`; `vis` contains the elements 0, 1, and 2.**

Explanation: The code `nums[start + 1] -= 1` updates the value of `nums[start + 1]`. Given that `start` is 2, `start + 1` equals 3. Therefore, `nums[3]` is decremented by 1. However, since the initial state only specifies the values of `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, and `nums[2]`, and does not provide an initial value for `nums[3]`, the value of `nums[3]` remains unchanged in terms of its relation to the other elements. The other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
