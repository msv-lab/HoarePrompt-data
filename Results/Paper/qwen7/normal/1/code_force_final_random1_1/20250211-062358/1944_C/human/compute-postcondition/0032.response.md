Output State: `start` is the last index where `nums[start]` is greater than 0; `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - (start)`, `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - (start-1)`, ..., `nums[start-1]` is `nums[start-1] - 1`, `vis` contains the elements from 0 to `start-1`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as there are non-zero values in `nums` starting from `start`. After each iteration, `start` is incremented, and the corresponding value in `nums` is decremented. If `nums[start + 1]` is not truthy, the loop prints `start + 1` and returns, stopping further iterations. Therefore, the final state will have `start` at the last position where `nums[start]` is still greater than 0. All previous positions from `start` back to 0 will have their values in `nums` decremented accordingly, and all indices from 0 to `start-1` will be in the `vis` set.
