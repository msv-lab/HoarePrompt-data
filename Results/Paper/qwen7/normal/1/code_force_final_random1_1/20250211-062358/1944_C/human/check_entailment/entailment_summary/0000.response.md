Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice appends elements to her array `c` and removes them from `a`, while Bob only removes elements from `a`. The goal is to find the MEX of `c` when the game ends, considering both players play optimally.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the possible values from `0` to `n-1` and checks if they exist in the counter.
   - If a value exists, it is marked as visited and removed from the counter.
   - The loop continues until it finds the smallest value that is not present in the counter.
   - This approach seems to be attempting to find the MEX of the array `c` that would result from the optimal play of both players.

3. **Optimal Play Consideration**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she should try to include as many unique numbers as possible in `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he should try to remove as many unique numbers as possible from `a`.

4. **Functionality Check**:
   - The function correctly identifies the smallest missing number in the sequence from `0` to `n-1` that is not present in the original array `arr`.
   - This is equivalent to finding the MEX of the array `c` that would result from optimal play, as Alice will always pick the smallest available number and Bob will always pick the largest available number.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where no numbers are left in the counter, which would mean the MEX is `n`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the optimal MEX value under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
