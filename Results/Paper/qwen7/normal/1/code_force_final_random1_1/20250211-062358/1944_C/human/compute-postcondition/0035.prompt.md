You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\) (i.e., 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5).
def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: Output State: `start` is the last index where `nums[start]` is greater than 0; `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - (start)`, `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - (start-1)`, ..., `nums[start-1]` is `nums[start-1] - 1`, `vis` contains the elements from 0 to `start-1`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues as long as there are non-zero values in `nums` starting from `start`. After each iteration, `start` is incremented, and the corresponding value in `nums` is decremented. If `nums[start + 1]` is not truthy, the loop prints `start + 1` and returns, stopping further iterations. Therefore, the final state will have `start` at the last position where `nums[start]` is still greater than 0. All previous positions from `start` back to 0 will have their values in `nums` decremented accordingly, and all indices from 0 to `start-1` will be in the `vis` set.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: start + 1 (where start is the last index where nums[start] is greater than 0)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of non-negative integers. Each integer in the list satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and the length of the list is \(n\) (i.e., 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). The function does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.

Case_2: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.

Case_3: The program does not return any value as there is no return statement in the provided code.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
