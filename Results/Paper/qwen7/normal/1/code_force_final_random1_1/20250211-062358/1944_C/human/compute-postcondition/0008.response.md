Output State: **`start` is 0; `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 1`; `vis` contains the element 0; the current value of `nums[start + 1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `nums[start + 1] -= 1` decrements the value of `nums[start + 1]` by 1. Given that `start` is 0, `nums[start + 1]` refers to `nums[1]`. Since the initial value of `nums[1]` is greater than 0, after executing the code, its value is decreased by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
