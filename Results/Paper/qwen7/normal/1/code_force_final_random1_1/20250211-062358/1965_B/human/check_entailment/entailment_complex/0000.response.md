Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads an integer from standard input and returns it. This is useful for reading the number of test cases.
   - `func_2()`: Reads a map of integers from standard input, split by spaces. This is not directly used in the problem but might be part of a larger function.
   - `func_3()`: Reads a list of integers from standard input. This is used to read the test cases.
   - `func_4(rows_number)`: Calls `func_3()` `rows_number` times. This is not used in the problem.
   - `func_5()`: Reads a line from standard input, removes trailing whitespace, and returns it. Not used in the problem.
   - `func_6()`: Reads a line from standard input, decodes it from bytes to string, and returns it stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. Not used in the problem.
   - `func_7()`: Reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input. This is similar to `func_3()`.
   - `func_8(rows)`: Calls `func_7()` `rows` times. Not used in the problem.
   - `func_9()`: Reads input from the user. Not used in the problem.
   - `func_10()`: Prompts the user to enter an integer and returns it. Not used in the problem.
   - `func_11()`: Reads a line from the user, splits it, and returns it as a list of strings. Not used in the problem.
   - `func_12()`: A complex function that uses recursion and a processing list. It is not used in the problem.
   - `func_13()`: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Not used in the problem.
   - `func_14()`: Generates a sequence of integers based on the problem requirements. This function is crucial for generating the required sequence.
   - `func_15()`: Loops `func_10()` times, calling `func_14()` each time and writing the result to standard output. This is the main function that outputs the solution for each test case.

2. **Problem Requirements**:
   - For each test case, we need to generate a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not contain any subsequence with a sum of `k`.
   - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there should be a subsequence of the sequence with a sum of `v`.

3. **Function `func_14()`**:
   - This function correctly generates the required sequence based on the value of `k` and `n`.
   - It handles both cases where `k` is 1 and where `k` is greater than 1.
   - For `k == 1`, it generates a sequence of powers of 2 starting from 2 up to \(2^{l-1}\).
   - For `k > 1`, it generates a sequence that includes `k-1`, `k+1`, and `2*k+1`, along with powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\).

4. **Function `func_15()`**:
   - It correctly loops over the number of test cases, calls `func_14()` for each test case, and writes the result to standard output.

Given the analysis, the functions `func_14()` and `func_15()` together correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
