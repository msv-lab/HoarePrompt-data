Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(lk - 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `lk`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < lk - 1` must be true.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `lk` must be greater than 2
   - `ans` contains the value 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The condition `lk > 2` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `lk` must be greater than 2

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 2, `lk` must be greater than 2**
