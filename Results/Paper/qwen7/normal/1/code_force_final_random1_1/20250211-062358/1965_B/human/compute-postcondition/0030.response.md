Output State: **`i` is equal to `lk - 2`, `lk` must be greater than 1, `ans` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, ..., 2^(lk-2)],` and `k + 1` is appended to `ans`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans.append(k + 1)` appends the value of `k + 1` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` was already defined as a list containing the values from 1 to \(2^{(lk-2)}\). After appending `k + 1`, the updated list `ans` will include all the previous values plus the new value `k + 1`.
