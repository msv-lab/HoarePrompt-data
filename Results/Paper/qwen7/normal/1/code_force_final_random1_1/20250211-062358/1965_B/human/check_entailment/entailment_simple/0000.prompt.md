Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

The list `ans` will contain all powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-2}\), because in each iteration of the loop, `ans.append(2 ** i)` adds the next power of 2 to the list, where `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

        #To understand this, let's break it down:
        #- Initially, `i` is set to `lk - 2`.
        #- The loop runs from `lk` to `l-1`, incrementing `i` by 1 each time.
        #- After the first iteration (`i = lk - 1`), `ans` contains `[2]`.
        #- After the second iteration (`i = lk`), `ans` contains `[2, 2]`.
        #- After the third iteration (`i = lk + 1`), `ans` contains `[2, 2, 4]`.
        #
        #Following this pattern, when the loop completes all its iterations (from `i = lk` to `i = l-1`), `i` will be `l - 1`. During each iteration, the value `2^i` is appended to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will contain all values from `2` up to `2^(l-1)`, including the initial values `[1, 2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2 * k + 1]` and the values added during the loop iterations.
    #State: `i` is either `l` or `l - 1`, and `ans` is a list containing all powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\), inclusive, with an additional value `2 * k + 1` at the beginning if `k == 1`.
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a string containing space-separated values from the list 'ans', which starts with the value 3 (since k == 1) followed by powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\)

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no integer `k` such that `1 <= k <= n` and there exists a subsequence of length at most 25 that sums to `k`. However, for all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there must exist a subsequence of length at most 25 that sums to `v`.

    #State: Output State: The loop will execute a total number of times equal to the return value of `func_10()`. For each iteration, `func_14()` will return an integer, which will then be written to stdout.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will consist of integers printed to the standard output, with the number of integers equal to the return value of `func_10()`. Each integer is the result of calling `func_14()` once per iteration.
