Output State: **`i` is equal to `lk - 2`; `lk` must be greater than 1; `ans` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, ..., 2^(lk-2)],` and `k - 1 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` remains equal to `lk - 2`. The list `ans` contains all powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-2}\). The code then appends the value of `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Here, `sum(ans)` is the sum of all elements in the list `ans`, which is the sum of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\). Therefore, `k - 1 - sum(ans)` is the value that is appended to `ans`.
