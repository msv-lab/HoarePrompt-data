The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of length equal to the maximum key in `d` filled with zeros, an integer `da`, and a list `rank` of length equal to the maximum key in `d` filled with zeros. It returns either 1 or `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the result of calling `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]`. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, the function immediately returns 1. Otherwise, it processes each element in `d[da]`, updates the `processing` list, and recursively calls itself to find the minimum value, which is then used to update `tmp`. Finally, it sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` and returns this value.
