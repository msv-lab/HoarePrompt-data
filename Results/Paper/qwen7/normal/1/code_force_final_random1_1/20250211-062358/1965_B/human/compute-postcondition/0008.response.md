Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether for all integers v from 1 to n (where v is not equal to k), there exists a subsequence of length at most 25 that sums to v, and there is no integer k such that 1 <= k <= n and there exists a subsequence of length at most 25 that sums to k.**
