### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code consists of several functions, but the main logic is in `func_5` and `func_6`.
   - `func_4` checks if the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( k \). If not, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
   - `func_1` attempts to construct a permutation that meets the required Manhattan value.
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are helper functions used to swap elements in the list.

3. **Key Points to Check:**
   - The function `func_1` should correctly construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
   - The function `func_4` should correctly calculate the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - The overall structure of the code should handle all edge cases and produce the correct output.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - `func_4` correctly calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \).
   - `func_1` has issues:
     - It incorrectly handles the decrement of `k` and the construction of the permutation.
     - The logic for constructing the permutation is flawed and does not guarantee a valid permutation for all cases.
     - The use of recursive calls in `func_1` and `func_3` is unnecessary and complicates the logic without adding value.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not ensure that the constructed permutation has the correct Manhattan value.
   - The code fails to handle certain edge cases and does not produce a valid permutation in some scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value for all cases.

**Correctness: False**
