Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - (n - 4) + 1 - (n - 4) + 1`, `c` is `c + 3`, `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`**

Explanation: The line `l = func_3(c, l)` updates the value of `l` to be the return value of the function `func_3(c, l)`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
