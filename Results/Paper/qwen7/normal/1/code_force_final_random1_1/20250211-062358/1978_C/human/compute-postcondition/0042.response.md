Postcondition: `i` is `n-4`, `k` is `k - 2n + 4`, `x` is now the first element of list `l`, and the second element of list `l` is the original second last element of list `l`. If `1 + i > k`, the list `l` has an additional element inserted at index `-k`, where `k` is `-2n + 6`. The second element of the list `l` is the original third last element of the list `l`. If `1 + i <= k`, the values of `i`, `k`, `x`, and the elements of list `l` remain unchanged.
