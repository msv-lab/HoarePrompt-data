Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    8 14
    
    112 777
    
    5 12
    
    5 2

    Yes
    3 1 2
    No
    Yes
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    No
    Yes
    8 2 3 4 5 6 1 7
    No
    Yes
    5 4 3 1 2
    Yes
    2 1 3 4 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    func_6()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        k = k - i + 1
        l = func_3(c, l)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. It processes these parameters through a series of conditional checks and function calls. If `k` is zero, it returns the initial list `l`. Otherwise, it iteratively decreases `i` by 2 starting from `n`, updating `c` and `k` accordingly. Depending on the conditions met during each iteration, it either returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` or the modified list `l` after calling `func_3(c, l)`. The final state of the program is determined by the specific case that matches the given conditions, ultimately returning either the unchanged initial list `l`, or the result of subsequent function calls involving `c`, `k`, and `l`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(c, k, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[-c - k])
    (l[-c], l[-c - k]) = (y, x)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts three parameters: `c` (a non-negative integer within the range of the list length), `k` (an integer within the range of the list length), and `l` (a list of integers representing a permutation of length n). It swaps the elements at indices `-c` and `-c-k` in the list `l`. After the swap, the function returns the modified list `l`, which remains a permutation of length n.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(c, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[c - 1])
    (l[c - 1], l[-c]) = (x, y)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function accepts an integer `c` (where \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{\text{len}(l)}{2}\)) and a list `l` of integers. It swaps the elements at positions `c-1` and `-c` in the list `l`. After performing the swap, it returns the modified list `l`. If no swap is performed (i.e., when the conditions are not met), it still returns the original list `l` unchanged.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2:
        return (0, 0)
    if n % 2:
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else:
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    if max_k < k:
        return (0, 0)
    return (n, k)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from input, where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). It checks if \(k\) is odd when \(n\) is odd, and if \(n\) is odd, it calculates the maximum possible value of \(k\) as \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\). If \(k\) exceeds this maximum value, it returns two zeros (0, 0). Otherwise, it returns \(n\) and \(k\). The function can return either two zeros (0, 0) or an integer \(n\) between 1 and 200000 and an integer \(k\) between 0 and 1000000000000.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function accepts a list `l` of integers, where each integer represents a position in the permutation of length `n` such that 1 <= l[i] <= n and all positions are distinct. It prints 'YES' followed by the elements of `l` in a single line, then prints an empty tuple `()`. The function ensures that the returned list `l` contains at least one element.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    (n, k) = func_4()
    if n == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function accepts no parameters and determines whether to return an integer \( k \) between 0 and \( 10^{12} \) or None. If \( n \) (obtained from `func_4()`) is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns. Otherwise, it processes \( n \) and \( k \) using `func_1()` and `func_5()`, then returns None.
