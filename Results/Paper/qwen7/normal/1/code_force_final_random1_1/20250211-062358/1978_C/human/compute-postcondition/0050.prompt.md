You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if 1 + i > k:
            x = l[-1]
            l.pop(-1)
            l.insert(-k, x)
            return l
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        x = l[-1]
        
        l.pop(-1)
        
        l.insert(0, x)
        
    #State: Output State: The list `l` will be reversed, with `k` being set to 0.
    #
    #Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the value of `i` decreases, and the operations inside the loop continue to manipulate the list `l` until `k` reaches 0 or the loop completes. Since the loop runs from `i = n-1` down to 0, it effectively reverses the list `l`. Once `k` reaches 0, the loop condition `if k == 0:` triggers the return statement, ending the loop. At this point, `l` is fully reversed, and `k` is reset to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12. The function returns a list `l` based on different conditions involving the manipulation of the list and the value of `k`. Depending on the specific condition met, the function may insert elements, update indices, or modify the list in various ways.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a value from variable 'l', but 'l' is not defined in the given initial state or code snippet.

Case_2: The program returns a list `l` which has `x` inserted at index `-k`. Here, `x` is calculated as `l[-1] - 1`, and `l` originally had `x` inserted at index `-k`.

Case_3: The program returns a list `l` where its first element is replaced by the second last element of the original list `l`, and `k` is updated to `k - (n-1) + 1`

Case_4: The program returns the list `l` with the last element moved to position `-k`, and the second last element of the modified list is described.

Case_5: The program returns the list `l` with its first element being the current value of `i` (which is `n-4`), and its second element being the original second last element of list `l`.

Case_6: The program returns the list `l` which has an additional element inserted at index `-k`, where `k` is `-2n + 6`. The second element of the list `l` is the original third last element of the list `l`, and `i` is `n-4`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
