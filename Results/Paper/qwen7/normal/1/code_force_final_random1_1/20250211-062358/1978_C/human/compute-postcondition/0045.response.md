Output State: **`i` is `n-5`, `k` is `k - 2n + 5`, `x` is the second last element of list `l`, and the second element of list `l` is the original third last element of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`. This means that the last element of the list `l` is no longer available, and the second last element becomes the new last element. The other variables `i`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged according to their initial definitions.
