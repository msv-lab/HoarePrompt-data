Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - (n - 4) + 1 - (n - 4) + 1`, `c` is `c + 3`, and `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`.**

Explanation: The code `k = k - i + 1` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `i` from it and adding 1. Given that `i` is `n - 4`, the new value of `k` becomes `k - (n - 4) + 1`. Since no other changes occur to the variables, `n` remains unchanged, `c` is updated to `c + 3`, and `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`. The condition checking whether `k` is less than `i - 1` or not is not evaluated here as it is outside the scope of the given code snippet.
