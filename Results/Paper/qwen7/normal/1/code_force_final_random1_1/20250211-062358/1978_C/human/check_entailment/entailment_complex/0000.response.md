Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_4`**: This function correctly checks if \(k\) is odd when \(n\) is odd and sets the maximum possible value of \(k\) based on \(n\). It ensures that \(k\) is within the valid range and returns appropriate values.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value. It uses a strategy of swapping elements to adjust the Manhattan value incrementally. The logic is sound for constructing permutations with specific Manhattan values, especially when considering the constraints.
3. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly swaps elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value. The swaps are made based on the current value of \(k\) and the index \(c\), ensuring the permutation's Manhattan value is adjusted appropriately.
4. **Function `func_3`**: This function swaps elements symmetrically around the middle of the list, which helps in adjusting the Manhattan value. The swaps are made based on the current value of \(c\), ensuring the permutation's structure remains valid.
5. **Function `func_5`**: This function correctly prints the "YES" message and the permutation. It ensures the output format is correct and handles the list as expected.
6. **Function `func_6`**: This function integrates the previous functions correctly. It first calls `func_4` to validate the inputs, then constructs the permutation using `func_1`, and finally prints the result using `func_5`.

Given the detailed analysis of each function and their interactions, the overall program logic is correct and meets the problem requirements. Each function performs its intended operation, and the program correctly handles both valid and invalid cases.

Correctness: **True**
