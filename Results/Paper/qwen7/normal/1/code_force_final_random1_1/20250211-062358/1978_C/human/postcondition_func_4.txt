The function accepts a list `l` of integers, where each integer represents a position in the permutation of length `n` such that 1 <= l[i] <= n and all positions are distinct. It prints 'YES' followed by the elements of `l` in a single line, then prints an empty tuple `()`. The function ensures that the returned list `l` contains at least one element.
