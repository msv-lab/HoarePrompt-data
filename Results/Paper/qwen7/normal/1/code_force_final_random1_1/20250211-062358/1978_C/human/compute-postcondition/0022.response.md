Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `c` is increased by 2, and `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` to `k - i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, `k` becomes `k - (n - 2) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial postconditions.
