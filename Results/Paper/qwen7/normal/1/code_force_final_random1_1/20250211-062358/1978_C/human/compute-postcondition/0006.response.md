Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12, `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, and `func_5(l)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code calls `func_5(l)`, where `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `l` now holds the result of calling `func_1(n, k)`. The function `func_5` is called with `l` as its argument, but since no return value from `func_5` is mentioned, only the call itself is noted.
