Output State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is an element of `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[i] = 0` sets the count of `i` in the dictionary `cnt_b` to 0. Since `i` is already an element of `b_values` and `cnt_b[i]` was previously 0, setting it to 0 again does not change its value. Therefore, the precondition remains the same.
