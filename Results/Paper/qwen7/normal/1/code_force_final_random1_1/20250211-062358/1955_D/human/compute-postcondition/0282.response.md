Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n - m` must be at least 1, `a[i]` (or `a[i + m]` if the condition is true) is an element in the set `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is adjusted: if `a[i + m]` (or `a[i]`) is in `b_values` and was greater than 0, it is decremented by 1; otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.
