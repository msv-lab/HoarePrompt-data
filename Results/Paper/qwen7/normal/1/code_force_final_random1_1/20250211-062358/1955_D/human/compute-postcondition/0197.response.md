Output State: **`a[i]` is an element of array `a` with its count in `cnt_b` incremented by 1, `b_values` retains its previous set of values, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` retains its previous value, `curr` is decremented by 1, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i + m`.**

This means that the current value of `curr` is reduced by 1, while all other specified variables retain their previous values.
