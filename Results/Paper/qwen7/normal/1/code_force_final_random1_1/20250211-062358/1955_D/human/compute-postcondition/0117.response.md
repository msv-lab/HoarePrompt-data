Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for the element at index `m-1`, `i` is `m - 1`**.

Explanation: The code increments the count of the element at index `i` (which is `m - 1`) in the dictionary `cnt_b`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
