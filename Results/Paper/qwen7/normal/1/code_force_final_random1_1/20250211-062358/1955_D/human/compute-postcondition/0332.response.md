Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers). It returns a result based on the given constraints and relationships between the inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases internally, where each test case includes specific integers and lists that meet certain criteria. The function processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns a result based on the logic applied to the test cases.
