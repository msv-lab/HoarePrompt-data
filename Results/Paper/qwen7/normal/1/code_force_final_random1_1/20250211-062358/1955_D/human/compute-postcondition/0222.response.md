Output State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` will be equal to `n - m`, `cnt_b[i]` will be 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `a`. The values of `b_values`, `i`, `cnt_b[i]`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
