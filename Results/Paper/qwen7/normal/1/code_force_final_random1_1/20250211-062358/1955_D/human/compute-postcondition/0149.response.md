Output State: **Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for each element in the range from `m-1` to `m-1 + (m - 1)`, `i` is equal to `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `curr` is incremented by 1 for each element in `a` that is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the variable `i` will be equal to `m` because the loop increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches `m`. The variable `curr` will be incremented by 1 for each element in `a` that is found in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative, as the loop decrements `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1 when these conditions are met. All other variables (`ans`, `a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b`, `cnt_b`, `b_values`) retain their states as they were initialized or updated within the loop body but are not further modified outside of it.
