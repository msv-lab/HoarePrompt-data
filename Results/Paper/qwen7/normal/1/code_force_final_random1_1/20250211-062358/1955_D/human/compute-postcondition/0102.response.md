Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head in the given code is `for i in b_values:`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `b_values`.

2. **Understand Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `b_values`.
   - The loop variable `i` will take on each value in `b_values` during the iterations.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop will iterate over `b_values`, the state of `b_values` must be such that it contains at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `i` will take on each value in `b_values` during the iterations, but no specific initial value for `i` is required since it will be set by the loop itself.

4. **Consider Postconditions:**
   - The postconditions mention that `ans` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.
   - This information is not directly relevant to the loop head adjustment because it describes what happens inside the loop body, not the initial state of the loop.

5. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b_values`.
   - For the loop to execute, `b_values` must contain at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element**
