Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input from the user, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `b`. The initial values of `a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged.
