Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, or remains unchanged if `a[i]` is not in `b_values`. `curr` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, or remains unchanged if `a[i]` is not in `b_values`. `ans` remains unchanged regardless of whether `a[i]` is in `b_values` or not.**
