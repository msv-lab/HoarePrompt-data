Output State: **`i` is in the range [0, n - m - 1], `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set of integers, the current value of `a[i]` is present in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
