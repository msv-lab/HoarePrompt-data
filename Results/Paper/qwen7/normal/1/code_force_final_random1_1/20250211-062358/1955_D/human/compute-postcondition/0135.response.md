Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is 0
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for each element in the range from `m-1` to `m-1 + (m - 1)`
   - `i` is less than `m`
   - `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`
   - `curr` is 1 if `a[i]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is less than `m` at the end of the previous iteration, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - The condition `i < m` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `ans` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- `b` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `m` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `cnt_b` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `b_values` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `curr` will depend on the value of `a[i + 1]` and `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]` but since we don't know the exact value of `a[i + 1]` or the updated value of `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]`, we cannot determine its exact value yet. However, we can say that `curr` will be 1 if `a[i + 1]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]` is non-negative, and `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]` will be decremented by 1 if `a[i + 1]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]` is non-negative.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for each element in the range from `m-1` to `m-1 + (m - 1)`, `i` is less than `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `curr` is 1 if `a[i + 1]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]` is non-negative, and `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + 1]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]` is non-negative.**
