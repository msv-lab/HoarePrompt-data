Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2 depending on the previous value, `n - m` must be at least 1, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is `curr + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n - m`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
