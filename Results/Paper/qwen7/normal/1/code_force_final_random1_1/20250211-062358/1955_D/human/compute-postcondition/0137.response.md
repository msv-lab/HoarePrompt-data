Output State: **`ans` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for each element in the range from `m-1` to `m-1 + (m - 1)`, `i` is less than `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `curr` is `curr + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. Since `curr` was previously equal to 1 if `a[i + 1]` was found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]` was non-negative, after this operation, `curr` will be 2 if those conditions were met, otherwise, it remains 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
