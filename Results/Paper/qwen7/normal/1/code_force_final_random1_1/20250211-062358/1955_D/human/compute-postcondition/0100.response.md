Output State: **Postcondition: `ans` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `i` iterates from `0` to `n - m - 1`, `curr` is updated based on the conditions involving `a[i]` and `a[i + m]` being in `b_values` and the corresponding counts in `cnt_b`, and `cnt_b` is adjusted accordingly.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `ans` will hold the total count of times `curr` reaches a value of `k` or more. The variable `i` will have gone through all possible indices from `0` to `n - m - 1`. During each iteration, `curr` is adjusted based on whether elements in `a` at positions `i` and `i + m` are found in `b_values`, and `cnt_b` is updated to reflect these changes.
