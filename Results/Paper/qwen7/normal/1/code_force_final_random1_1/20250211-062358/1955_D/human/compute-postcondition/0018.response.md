Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros except for indices in `b` which are incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `b_values` is a set containing unique values from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `curr` to 0. Since `curr` was not previously initialized, its initial value is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
