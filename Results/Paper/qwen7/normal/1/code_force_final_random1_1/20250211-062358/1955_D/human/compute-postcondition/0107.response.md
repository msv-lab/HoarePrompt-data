Output State: **`cnt_b[i]' is set to 0, `i` is the next value from `b_values'**.

Explanation: The code sets the value of `cnt_b[i]` to 0, where `i` is the next value from `b_values`. The initial state of `cnt_b[i]` being updated but not known precisely is now specifically that it is set to 0. The value of `i` remains as the next value from `b_values`.
