Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code decrements `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. Since `a[i + m]` is present in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was previously incremented when `a[i]` was found in `b_values`. Now, it is simply decremented by 1. The values of `a`, `i`, `b_values`, and `curr` remain unchanged.
