Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n - m`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `i` is within the range defined by `range(n - m)`. This means `i` should start from 0 and go up to `n - m - 1`.

3. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing with the correct initial state for `i`. The variable `n - m` defines the upper limit of the range, but since we are focusing on the starting state of the loop, we only need to adjust `i`.

Given the postconditions:
- `ans` is incremented by 1.
- `i` equals `m`.
- `curr` is incremented by 1 each time `a[i]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative.
- `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 each time `a[i]` is processed.
- The final value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` in each iteration, we need to ensure that `i` starts at `m` (as per the postcondition).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` starts at `m`.

**State:**
**`i` is `m`, `n` must be greater than `m`**

This ensures that the loop can start executing with `i` set to `m`, and the loop will run for `n - m` iterations, starting from `i = m`.
