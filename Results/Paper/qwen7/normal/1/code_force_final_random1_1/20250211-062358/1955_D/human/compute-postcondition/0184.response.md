Postcondition: `a[i]` is an element of array `a`, and `b_values` is a set of values. If `a[i]` is found in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and `curr` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0. If `a[i]` is not found in `b_values` or `cnt_b[a[i]]` is not greater than 0, the values of `cnt_b[a[i]]` and `curr` remain unchanged.
