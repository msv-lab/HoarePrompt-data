Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - m - 1`, `ans` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` will reflect the final decremented and incremented counts respectively based on the elements in `b_values`, and `curr` will be the final count of elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values` and have non-negative decremented counts.
Code of the loop:
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is the first element of `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `i` is the second element of `b_values`, `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `i` is the third element of `b_values`, `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
