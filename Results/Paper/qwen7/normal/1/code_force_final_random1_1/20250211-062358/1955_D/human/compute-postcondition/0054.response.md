Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, and the current value of `a[i]` is present in `b_values`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0; `curr` is decremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `curr` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
