Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for each element in the range from `m-1` to `m-1 + (m - 1)`, `i` is equal to `m - 1 + (m - 1)`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b_values = set(b)` creates a set of unique elements from the list `b`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b`, `cnt_b`, or `i`. The set `b_values` is created and contains all unique elements from the list `b`.
