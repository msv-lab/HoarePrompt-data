Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3; `n - m` must be at least 1; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; `curr` is 0; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`**

Explanation: The code `curr -= 1` decrements the value of `curr` by 1. Given that `curr` was previously incremented by 1, it now becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
