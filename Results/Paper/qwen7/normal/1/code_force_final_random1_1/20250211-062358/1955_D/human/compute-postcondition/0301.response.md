Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2 depending on the previous value, `n - m` must be at least 1, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
