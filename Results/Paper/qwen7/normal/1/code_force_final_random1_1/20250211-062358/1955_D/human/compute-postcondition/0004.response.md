Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `max_val`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
