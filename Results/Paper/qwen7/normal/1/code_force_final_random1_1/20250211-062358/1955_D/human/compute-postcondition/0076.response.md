Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. Since `a[i + m]` is an element of the list `a`, the dictionary `cnt_b` is updated by decrementing the count associated with `a[i + m]`. The other variables (`i`, `b_values`, `curr`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
