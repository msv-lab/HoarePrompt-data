Postcondition: `a[i]` is an element of array `a`, `b_values` retains its previous set of values, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` retains its previous value (or is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative), `curr` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `i` is now `i + 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` must be greater than `i + m`.
