Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts each integer to an int using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `b`. The values of `t`, `max_val`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
