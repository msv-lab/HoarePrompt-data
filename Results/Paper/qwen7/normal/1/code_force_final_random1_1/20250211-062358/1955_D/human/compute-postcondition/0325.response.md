Output State: **`cnt_b[i]` is 0, `i` is the second element of `b_values`, `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements**

Explanation: The line `cnt_b[i] = 0` sets the value of `cnt_b[i]` to 0. The values of `i` and `b_values` remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements is also preserved.
