Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `b_values` must contain at least one element.
- `i` is `(n - m) + 1`.
- `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = m - 1`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `(n - m) + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Check if the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - Given `i = (n - m) + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `(n - m) + 1` must be less than `m`.

2. **Adjust `i`**:
   - If `(n - m) + 1 < m`, then `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `(n - m) + 2`.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `b_values` must still contain at least one element.
   - `cnt_b[b[i]]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `b_values` must contain at least one element.
- `i` will be `(n - m) + 2`.
- `cnt_b[b[i]]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

### Answer:
State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is `(n - m) + 2`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` will be incremented by 1**.
