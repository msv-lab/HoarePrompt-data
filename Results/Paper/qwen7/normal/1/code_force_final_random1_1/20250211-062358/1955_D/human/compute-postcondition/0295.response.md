Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2 depending on the previous value, `n - m` must be at least 1, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code decrements `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. The value of `i` remains either 1 or 2, and the condition `n - m` must be at least 1 still holds. The value of `curr` is not affected by this operation, so it remains unchanged.
