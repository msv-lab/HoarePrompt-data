Output State: **`cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The line `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. The value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 from its previous state, and `a[i]` remains an element of array `a`. The set `b_values` remains unchanged.
