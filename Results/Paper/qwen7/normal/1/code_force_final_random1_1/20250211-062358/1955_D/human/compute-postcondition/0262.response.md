Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n - m`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0` (as is typical for `range(n - m)`), `i` should be initialized to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - m`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - m`.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables (`ans`, `a`, `b_values`, `curr`, and `cnt_b`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. However, they might be modified within the loop body, but we are only concerned with the initial state required for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `i` is 0 and `i` is less than `n - m` for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `i` is 0, `i` must be less than `n - m`**
