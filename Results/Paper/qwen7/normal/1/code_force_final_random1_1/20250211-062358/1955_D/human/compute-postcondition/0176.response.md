Output State: **`i` is in the range [0, n - m - 1], `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `curr` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In this step, the variable `ans` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated state of `ans` is now one more than its previous value.
