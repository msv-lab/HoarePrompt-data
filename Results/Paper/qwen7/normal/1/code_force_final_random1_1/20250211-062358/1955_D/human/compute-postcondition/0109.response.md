Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for` statement:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
   ```
   - The variable `_` is used as a placeholder, typically indicating that the value is not being used.
   - The loop will run for a number of times equal to the integer input provided by the user.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - All values in `cnt_b` are 0.

3. **Understand what changes occur within the loop**:
   - Since the loop body is omitted, no specific operations are performed inside the loop that would change the state of `cnt_b`.
   - The only thing that changes is the number of iterations remaining, which is controlled by the `range(int(input()))`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the input provided by the user must be greater than 0 (since `range(0)` would produce an empty sequence).
   - Therefore, the loop will continue if the input is at least 1.

5. **Adjust the state accordingly**:
   - The state of `cnt_b` remains unchanged because no operations are specified in the loop body.
   - The only thing that needs to be adjusted is the condition for the loop to continue, which is based on the input provided.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **All values in `cnt_b` are 0, and the input provided by the user must be at least 1**.
