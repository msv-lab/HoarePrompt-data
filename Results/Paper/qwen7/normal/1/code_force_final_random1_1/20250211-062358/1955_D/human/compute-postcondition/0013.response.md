Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros with the element at index `b[1]` incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is 4, `m` is greater than 3, `cnt_b[b[4]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count at the index `b[4]` in the list `cnt_b`. Since `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and `i` is 4, `b[4]` refers to the fifth element in the list `b`. The initial state of `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, with the element at index `b[1]` already incremented by 1. Now, the element at index `b[4]` (which is the fifth element) is also incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
