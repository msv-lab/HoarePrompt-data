State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.
2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(m):` will execute as long as `m` is at least 1. The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
3. **Adjust States**: 
   - `i` should be set to 0 because it is the initial value for the loop.
   - `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

The other variables (`t`, `max_val`, `cnt_b`, and `b`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
