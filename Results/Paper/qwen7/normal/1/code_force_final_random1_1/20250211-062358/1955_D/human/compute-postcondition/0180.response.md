Output State: **`cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. Since `a[i]` is an index into the dictionary `cnt_b`, the specific key `a[i]` is being accessed and its corresponding value is incremented. The initial state does not provide specific values for `cnt_b` or `a[i]`, so we only know that the value associated with the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` is incremented by 1.
