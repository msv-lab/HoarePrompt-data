Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `curr` is `curr` + 1, `i` is `k + 1`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `curr` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `a` and `b_values` are lists of integers, `i` is `k + 1`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.
