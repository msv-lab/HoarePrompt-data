Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(m)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `m`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b_values` is a list of integers.
   - `curr` is an integer.
   - If `a[i]` is present in `b_values`, then `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not present in `b_values`, then `curr` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `m`, these are the only variables that need to be adjusted.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was some value `k` (where `k < m-1`), and `m` remained unchanged.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` becomes `k + 1`.
   - `m` remains the same.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The new state should reflect the updated value of `i` and the unchanged value of `m`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `curr` is an integer, `i` is `k + 1`, and `m` is the same as before.**
