Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `curr` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k + 2`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. The values of `a`, `b_values`, `curr`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `if a[i] in b_values:` is not explicitly checked within the given code snippet, so we only reflect the action taken on `cnt_b[a[i]]`.
