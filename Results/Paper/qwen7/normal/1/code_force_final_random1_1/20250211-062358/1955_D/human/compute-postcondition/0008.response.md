Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros with the element at index `b[i]` incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1**.

Explanation: The code increments the count of the element `b[i]` in the list `cnt_b`. Initially, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros. After executing `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1`, the count at the index `b[i]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 (from 0 to 1) because the operation is typically part of a loop that processes each element of the list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
