Postcondition: **`i` is in the range [0, n - m - 1], `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `curr` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
