Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `a[i]` is an element of array `a`, and `b_values` is a set of values. If `a[i + m]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the values of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `curr` remain unchanged.**

This means that `ans` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions related to `a[i + m]`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain as described in the initial state.
