Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` which is iterating over `b_values`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over `b_values`, the initial value of `i` should be the first element of `b_values`.

3. **Determine the Final State of `i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - m - 1`. This means the loop will iterate from the first element of `b_values` to `n - m - 1`.

4. **Understand the Loop Body Effects**:
   - `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `cnt_b[a[i]]` reflects the final decremented count based on the elements in `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` reflects the final incremented count based on the elements in `b_values`.
   - `curr` reflects the final count of elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values` and have non-negative decremented counts.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` must start from the first element of `b_values` and end at `n - m - 1`.
   - `b_values` must contain enough elements to cover the range from the first element to `n - m - 1`.
   - `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` will be updated during the loop, but their initial values do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` must start from the first element of `b_values`.
- `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements (since `i` goes up to `n - m - 1`).

Therefore, the state after adjustment would be:

**State: **`i` is the first element of `b_values`, `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements**.
