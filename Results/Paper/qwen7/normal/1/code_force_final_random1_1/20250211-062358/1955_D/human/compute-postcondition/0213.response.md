Output State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is an element of `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**

The code sets the count of `i` in the dictionary `cnt_b` to 0. Since `i` is an element of `b_values`, the only change is that `cnt_b[i]` is now 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
