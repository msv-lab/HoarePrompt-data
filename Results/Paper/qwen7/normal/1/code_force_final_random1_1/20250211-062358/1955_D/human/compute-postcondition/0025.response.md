Output State: **`i` is less than `m`, `m` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, and the current value of `a[i]` is present in the set `b_values`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0; `curr` is equal to the previous value of `curr` plus 1.**

In this case, the variable `curr` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
