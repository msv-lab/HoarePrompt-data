Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(l)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `l`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - `l` must be greater than 0
   - `ans` contains the element `alp[rev_array[1:].count(rev_array[1]) - 1]`
   - `ans` contains one more element `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j < l`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - `l` must still be greater than 0 (it remains unchanged from the previous state).

5. **Adjust the state of `ans`**:
   - The new element added to `ans` in this iteration would be `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`.
   - Since `j` is now 3, the new element added to `ans` would be `alp[rev_array[3:].count(rev_array[3]) - 1]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `j` is 3
- `l` must be greater than 0
- `ans` contains the element `alp[rev_array[1:].count(rev_array[1]) - 1]`
- `ans` contains one more element `alp[rev_array[3:].count(rev_array[3]) - 1]`

So, the final state is:

**State: **`j` is 3, `l` must be greater than 0, `ans` contains the element `alp[rev_array[1:].count(rev_array[1]) - 1]` and `ans` contains one more element `alp[rev_array[3:].count(rev_array[3]) - 1]`**
