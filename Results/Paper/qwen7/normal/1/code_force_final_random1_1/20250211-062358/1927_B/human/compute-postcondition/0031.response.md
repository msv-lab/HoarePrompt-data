Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is equal to `l`, where `l` is an input integer.
   - `ans` is a list containing all the alphabets from the string `alp` based on the count condition specified in the loop body.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 to `i+1`.
   - `array` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `alp` is a list of alphabets starting from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `int(input())`. Therefore, `i` needs to be less than `int(input())` for the loop to execute again.

Given these points, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `i`. The value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `i + 1`, and it needs to be less than `int(input())` for the loop to continue.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is equal to `l`, `l` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing all the alphabets from the string `alp` based on the count condition specified in the loop body, `i` is less than `int(input())`, `array` is a list of integers input by the user, `alp` is a list of alphabets starting from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`**.
