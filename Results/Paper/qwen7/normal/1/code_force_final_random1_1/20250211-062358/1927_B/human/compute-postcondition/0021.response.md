Output State: **`j` is equal to `l`, `l` is an input integer, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is incremented by 1 to `i+1`, `array` is a list of integers input by the user, `alp` is a list of alphabets starting from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = []` initializes an empty list for `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
