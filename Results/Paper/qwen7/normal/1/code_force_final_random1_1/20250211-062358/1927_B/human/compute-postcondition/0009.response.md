Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for j in range(l)`. The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `l`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `l` must be a positive integer.
   - `ans` contains the element `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < l`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must remain a positive integer.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `j` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `l` must still be a positive integer.
   - `ans` will now contain the element `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`, which means it will depend on the value of `j` being 1.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is 1, `l` must be a positive integer, `ans` contains the element `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`**
