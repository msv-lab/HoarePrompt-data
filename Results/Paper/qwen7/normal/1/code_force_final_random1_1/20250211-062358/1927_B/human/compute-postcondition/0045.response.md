Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `l` for each iteration of `i`. The variable `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases provided as input. The variable `l` will be a positive integer representing the length of the input array for each test case. The variable `array` will be a list of integers that was input for each test case. The variable `alp` will remain as a list of alphabets from 'a' to 'z'. The variable `rev_array` will be the reversed version of `array`. The variable `ans` will be a list containing `l` elements, where each element is determined by counting the occurrences of the current value of `j` in the reversed `array` (starting from `j` to the end of the array) and then indexing into the `alp` list with that count minus one. Finally, the program will print the concatenated string of elements in `ans`.
