Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(l)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `l`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `j` will take values from 0 to `l-1` during the loop iterations.
   - `l` is the upper limit of the range function.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `j` is initially equal to `l`.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `i` is less than `int(input())`.
   - `array` is updated to a list of integers input by the user using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `alp` is a list of alphabets starting from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `rev_array` is the reversed version of the updated `array`.
   - `l` is updated to the new integer input (this is redundant as `l` is already defined as an input integer).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is currently equal to `l`, the loop will not execute because `range(l)` will generate numbers from 0 to `l-1`, and `j` cannot be equal to `l` for the loop to iterate.
   - We need to set `j` to 0 and ensure `l` is a positive integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` to 0 and `l` to a value greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0**
