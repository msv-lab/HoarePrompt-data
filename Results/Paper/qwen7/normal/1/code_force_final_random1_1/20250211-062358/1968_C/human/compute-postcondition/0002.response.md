Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `x`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
