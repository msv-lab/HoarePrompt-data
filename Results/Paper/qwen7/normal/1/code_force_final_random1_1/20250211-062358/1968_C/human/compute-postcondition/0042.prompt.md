Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 1000
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` will be updated such that for every index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` will be the sum of `a[0]` (which is initially 1000) and the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `x`.

This means that `a[i]` will contain the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of `x`, starting from 1000. For example, if `x = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `n = 4`, then after the loop, `a` will be `[1000, 1001, 1004, 1008]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The list `a` will be transformed such that each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will hold the sum of the first `i` elements from the list `x`. Specifically, `a[i]` will be equal to the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.

For example, if `x = [10, 20, 30, 40]` and `n = 5`, then after the loop completes, `a` will be `[1000, 110, 130, 160, 200]`. Here's how it breaks down:
- `a[1] = 1000 + x[0] = 1000 + 10 = 1010`
- `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 1010 + 20 = 1030`
- `a[3] = a[2] + x[2] = 1030 + 30 = 1060`
- `a[4] = a[3] + x[3] = 1060 + 40 = 1100`

So, the final state of `a` will be a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `x`, starting with `1000` as the first element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 1000, and each subsequent element being the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `x`. `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer; `i` is `n`.

To explain this output state in natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have been updated such that the first element remains 1000, and each element from the second to the last will be the cumulative sum of 1000 plus the sum of all elements in `x` up to that point. The variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
