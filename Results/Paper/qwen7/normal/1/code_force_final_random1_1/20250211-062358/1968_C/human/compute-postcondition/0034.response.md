Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 1000, the second element being `1000 + x[0]`, and all other elements being 0; `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer; `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the element `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given that initially `a[1]` (which corresponds to `a[i]` since `i` is 1) is 1000 and all other elements are 0, and `x[0]` is the first element of the list `x`, `a[1]` is updated to `1000 + x[0]`. The value of `i` is then incremented to 2.
