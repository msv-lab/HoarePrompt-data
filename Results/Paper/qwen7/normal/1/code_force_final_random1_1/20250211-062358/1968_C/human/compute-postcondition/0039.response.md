Output State: `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 1000 and all other elements being the cumulative sum of 1000 and the corresponding elements of `x` up to the (n-1)th position; `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer; `i` is `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have its first element as 1000, and each subsequent element will be the sum of 1000 and all the elements in `x` up to that point. For example, if `a` has 5 elements and `x` is `[10, 20, 30, 40]`, then `a` will be `[1000, 1010, 1030, 1060, 1100]`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, the length of the list `a`.
