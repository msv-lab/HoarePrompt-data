Output State: **`a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state where `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `n`, and `n` must be at least 2, the only change is that `a[i]` now holds the value of `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
