Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1` (since the loop condition is `range(1, n)`).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 because `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value does not affect the loop execution directly, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
   - `i` will start from 1, but since we are adjusting the state before the loop starts, we don't need to specify its initial value explicitly as it will be set by the loop itself.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be at least 2.
- `i` will start from 1, but we don't need to specify this explicitly since it is determined by the loop itself.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`n` must be at least 2**.
