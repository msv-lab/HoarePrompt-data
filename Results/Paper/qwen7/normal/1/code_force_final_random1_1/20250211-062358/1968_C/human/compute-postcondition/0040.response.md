Output State: `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 1000, and each subsequent element being the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `x`. `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer; `i` is `n`.

To explain this output state in natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have been updated such that the first element remains 1000, and each element from the second to the last will be the cumulative sum of 1000 plus the sum of all elements in `x` up to that point. The variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
