Output State: **The value of `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, while `n` remains at least 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. However, the initial state specifies that `n` must be at least 2, which means `n` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `n` remains unchanged, and only `a[i]` is updated based on the given formula.
