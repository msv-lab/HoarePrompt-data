Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [2, 0, 1], `tot` is 4, `pow` is 4, `t` must be greater than 3, `n` is 0, `m` is 1**

Explanation: The code `L.append(m)` appends the value of `m` (which is 1) to the list `L`. Initially, `L` is `[2, 0]`. After appending `m`, `L` becomes `[2, 0, 1]`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `tot`, `pow`, `t`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
