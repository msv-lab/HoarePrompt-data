Output State: **`a` is 0, `L` is [2], `k` is less than or equal to 4, `pow` is 8, `tot` is 2, `n` is 1, `m` is 1**

Explanation: The code `m = (n + 1) // 2` calculates the value of `m` by adding 1 to `n` (which is 1) and then performing integer division by 2. Since both `n` and `1` are integers, the result of `1 + 1` is 2, and when divided by 2, it results in 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
