Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases where each test case contains integers t, n, and k such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it processes these integers and returns a value based on the given constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing three integers: `t`, `n`, and `k`. The function processes these integers according to the specified constraints and returns a value (or values) for each test case.
