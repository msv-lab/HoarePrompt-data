Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `L` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `L`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
