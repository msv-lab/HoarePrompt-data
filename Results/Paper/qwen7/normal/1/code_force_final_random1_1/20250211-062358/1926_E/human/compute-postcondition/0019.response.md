Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `L` is a list containing the values `[2, m, m]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `pow` is 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `pow` to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
