Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `L` is a list containing up to three elements `[n + 1 // 2, m, m]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero. After each iteration, `n` is reduced by `m`, where `m` is set to `(n + 1) // 2`. This process continues until `n` becomes 0. At this point, the loop terminates. Since `n` is reduced by half (rounded down) in each iteration, it will eventually reach 0. The list `L` accumulates the values of `m` from each iteration, with a maximum of three elements based on the provided information.
