Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for a in L:`. The objects involved here are `a` and `L`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `a` is initially set to the first element of `L`.
   - `L` is a list `[2, 0, 1]`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements left in the list `L`.
   - Since `a` takes on the values of each element in `L` one by one, the loop will start with `a` being 2 (the first element of `L`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `a` is set to the first element of `L`, which is 2.
   - We also need to ensure that `L` still has elements to iterate over.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `a` and `L`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`a` is 2, `L` is [2, 0, 1]**
