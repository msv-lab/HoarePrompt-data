Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all test cases specified by `t` are processed. After all iterations, the final output will depend on the last test case's values of `n` and `k`. If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, the final state will be that `s` is the sum of all values added to it during each iteration of the loop, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is 1, `g` is the sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) for each iteration, `f` is \(k - g\), and `y` is calculated as \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times (k - g) - 1)\). If `k \leq (n + 1) // 2`, then `s` remains 0, `i` remains 0, `d` remains `n`, `h` remains `n`, `p` remains 1, `g` remains 0, and `f` remains \(k - g\).

The final output for each test case will be printed as `y`, which is determined based on whether `k` is greater than or less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).
