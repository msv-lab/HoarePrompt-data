Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    i = 0
    d = n
    h = n
    p = 1
    g = 0
    if k > (n + 1) // 2:
        while s < k and d > 0:
            s += (d + 1) // 2
            d -= (d + 1) // 2
            i += 1
        while p <= i - 1:
            g += (h + 1) // 2
            h -= (h + 1) // 2
            p += 1
        f = k - g
        y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
        print(y)
    else:
        print(2 * k - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). If `k > \frac{n + 1}{2}`, then `s` is the sum of all values added to it during each iteration of the loop and equals \(k - \frac{n + 1}{2}\), `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed and equals \(n\), `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is \(k - g\), and `y` is \(2^{(n-1)} \cdot (2 \cdot (k - g) - 1)\). If `k \leq \frac{n + 1}{2}`, then `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `f` is \(k - g\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). If `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), then `n` must be greater than 1 and less than \(4k - 1\), `s` is equal to the sum of \((d + 1) // 2\) iterated `i` times, `d` is reduced to 0 after all iterations, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is equal to the sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) for each iteration, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times (k - g) - 1)\). Otherwise, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is assigned the value of `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `input_value - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and either `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\) where `g` is the sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) for each iteration, `h` is reduced by \((h + 1) // 2\) for each iteration until `d` becomes 0, `p` is equal to the total number of iterations `i`, `d` is 0, `s` is incremented until it reaches or exceeds `k`, `i` is the total number of iterations performed, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1)\), or `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
