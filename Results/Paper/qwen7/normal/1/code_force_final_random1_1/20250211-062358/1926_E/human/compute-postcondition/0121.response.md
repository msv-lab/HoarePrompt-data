Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [1], `tot` is 4, `pow` is 8.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute until `L` is empty. From the given information, we can deduce the following:

- After the first iteration, `a` is set to the first element of `L`, which is 2, and then `a` is updated to the next element in `L`, which is 0.
- After the second iteration, `a` is set to 0, and then `a` is updated to the next element in `L`, which is 1.
- After the third iteration, `L` becomes empty, so the loop terminates.

At this point, `tot` has accumulated the sum of elements in `L` (2 + 0 + 1 = 3), but since the last element added was 1, `tot` becomes 4. The variable `pow` is multiplied by 2 for each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `pow` is \(2^3 = 8\).

Since `L` is now [1] and will be empty after the next iteration, the loop will terminate. Therefore, the final state of the variables is `a` is 1 (the last element of the original list `L`), `L` is [1] (but will become empty after the next iteration), `tot` is 4, and `pow` is 8.
