Output State: **`a` is 0, `L` is [0], `k` is less than or equal to 4, `pow` is 8, `tot` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers, assigning the first input to `n` and the second input to `k`. The values of `a`, `L`, `k` (which was already defined before the input), `pow`, and `tot` remain unchanged.
