Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `L` is a list containing two elements `[n + 1 // 2, m]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The code `L.append(m)` appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Given that `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2` and `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `n` becomes 0. Therefore, `m` also becomes 0. Initially, `L` contains one element `(n + 1) // 2`, which is now 0. After appending `m` (which is also 0), `L` now contains two elements: `[0, 0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.
