Output State: **`a` is 2, `L` is [2, 0, 0], `k` is less than or equal to `tot` + 2, `pow` is multiplied by 2.**

Explanation: The code `pow *= 2` multiplies the value of `pow` by 2. However, the initial value of `pow` is not specified in the initial state, so we only know that `pow` has been updated. The other variables (`a`, `L`, `k`, and `tot`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
