Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `h` is initialized to `n`.
   - `d` is set to 0.
   - `p` is set to the total number of iterations `i`.
   - `s` is incremented until it reaches or exceeds `k`.

2. **Loop:**
   - For each iteration, `g` is updated as the sum of `(h + 1) // 2`.
   - `h` is reduced by `(h + 1) // 2`.
   - This loop continues until `d` becomes 0. Since `d` is initially 0 and no other operations change it, this loop does not run.

3. **Final Values:**
   - `i` is the total number of iterations performed, which is the same as `p`.
   - `f` is calculated as `k - g`.
   - `y` is calculated as \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1)\).

Given these steps, let's determine the values:

- `h` starts as `n` and is reduced by `(h + 1) // 2` in each iteration. Since `d` is never changed to a non-zero value, the loop does not run, so `h` remains `n`.
- `g` is the sum of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, but since the loop does not run, `g` is 0.
- `f` is `k - g`, so `f` is `k - 0 = k`.
- `i` is the number of iterations, which is the same as `p`.
- `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1)\). Substituting the values, we get \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times k - 1)\).

Therefore, the print statement will output:

Output: **2**(i - 1) \* (2 \* k - 1)
