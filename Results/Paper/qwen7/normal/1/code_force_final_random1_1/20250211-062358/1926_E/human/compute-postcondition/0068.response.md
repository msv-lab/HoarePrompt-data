Output State: **`a` is 2, `L` is [2, 1, 1], `pow` is 2**

Explanation: The initial state includes `a` being 2, `L` being [2, 1, 1], and `tot` being equal to `tot` + 2 (which implies `tot` is now 4). The code snippet `pow *= 2` doubles the value of `pow`. Since `pow` was not initially defined, it is assumed to be 1 (the default value for multiplication operations without an initial value). After executing `pow *= 2`, `pow` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
