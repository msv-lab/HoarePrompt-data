Output State: **`a` is 2, `L` is [2, 0, 1], `pow` is multiplied by 2**.

The initial state includes `a` being 2, `L` being `[2, 0, 1]`, and `tot` being `tot` + 2. The code snippet `pow *= 2` multiplies the value of `pow` by 2. Since the initial value of `pow` is not specified, we only know that it has been multiplied by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
