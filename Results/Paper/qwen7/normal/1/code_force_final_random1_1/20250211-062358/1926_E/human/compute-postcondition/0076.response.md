Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is explicitly given as 1.
- `L` is explicitly given as a list containing the single element 1.

However, the code snippet includes variables `pow`, `k`, and `tot` which are not defined in the initial state. Since these variables are not provided, we cannot determine their values and thus cannot compute the exact output of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

Therefore, the output will be a placeholder expression indicating the form of the output based on the undefined variables.

Output: **pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)**
