The loop condition is `while n:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is non-zero. Given that `n` is currently 0, we need to adjust `n` to be non-zero for the loop to execute one more time.

Let's break down the states:

- `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000: This state does not affect the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed.
- `n` is 0: To make the loop execute again, `n` must be non-zero. We can set `n` to 1 (or any non-zero value).
- `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split: This state does not affect the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed.
- `L` is a list containing two elements `[n + 1 // 2, m]`: Since `n` is 0, `L` is currently `[1, m]`. This state does not affect the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed.
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`: With `n` being 0, `m` is currently 1. This state does not affect the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `L` is a list containing two elements `[n + 1 // 2, m]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2**
