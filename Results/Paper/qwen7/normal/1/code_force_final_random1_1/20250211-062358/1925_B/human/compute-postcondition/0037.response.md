Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

3. **Check the Initial State:**
   - `q` is set to `k + 1`.
   - `ans` is set to `1`.
   - `x` is an integer from the input.
   - `n` is an integer from the input.

4. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will start as long as `1` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

5. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be at least `1`.
   - This implies that `sqrt(x)` must be non-negative, which means `x` must be non-negative.
   - Additionally, since `i` starts from `1`, the loop will always execute as long as `x` is non-negative.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `x` is non-negative for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`q`, `ans`, and `n`) do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

- `x` must be non-negative.

**Final State:**
State: **`q` is `k + 1`, `ans` is 1, `x` must be non-negative, `n` is an integer from the input**
