Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value among all possible `i` values (from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`) that satisfy either of the two conditions within the loop, and `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `x` and `n` remain the same as their initial values.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the maximum value of `i` that satisfies either of the two conditions specified in the loop body. The variable `i` will take the final value it was assigned in the last iteration of the loop, which is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. The values of `x` and `n` will remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
