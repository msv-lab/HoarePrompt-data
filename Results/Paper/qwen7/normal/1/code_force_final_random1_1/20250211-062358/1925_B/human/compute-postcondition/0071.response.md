Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to `sqrt(x) + 1`, `q` is incremented by 1, `x` and `n` are now integers read from input.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` to 1. The values of `i`, `q`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states since no operations were performed on them. Therefore, `ans` is set to 1, and the other variables retain their previous values.
