Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` and `n` are integers input from the user.
   - `ans` is updated based on the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the specified range.

5. **Check the Range**:
   - The loop will stop when `i` reaches `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

6. **Update the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless the condition is met during the current iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `ans` remains unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `x // i` if the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is true; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1 and still within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`**.
