Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user split by space, `n` is an integer input from the user split by space**.

Explanation: The code `x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts based on spaces, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `n`. The initial state's information about the variables being in a specific condition (like being positive or negative) is not applicable here since the values are directly assigned from user input.
