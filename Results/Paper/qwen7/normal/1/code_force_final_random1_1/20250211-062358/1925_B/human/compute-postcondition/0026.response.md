Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, and `i` must be within the range 1 to int(sqrt(x)) + 1; `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by setting it to the maximum value between its current value and `x // i`. The values of `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition for `i` remains the same, being within the range 1 to int(sqrt(x)) + 1. The variable `ans` is updated based on the new value of `x // i`.
