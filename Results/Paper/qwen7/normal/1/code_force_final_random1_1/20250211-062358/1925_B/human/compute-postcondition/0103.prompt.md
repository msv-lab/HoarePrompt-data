Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(int(input())):
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x
                 // i) == 0:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The value of `ans` will be the maximum value it attains during any iteration of the loop where the conditions `x % i == 0` and either of the two conditions inside the loop body are satisfied. Specifically, these conditions are:

1. \( x - n \cdot i \geq 0 \) and \( (x - n \cdot i) \% i == 0 \)
2. \( x - n \cdot (x // i) \geq 0 \), \( x // i > 0 \), and \( (x - n \cdot (x // i)) \% (x // i) == 0 \)

The output state after the loop executes all iterations is the final value of `ans` that satisfies the above conditions for any valid `i` within the range \(1\) to \(\text{int}(\sqrt{x}) + 1\).

In simpler terms, `ans` will hold the largest value among all possible `i` values that meet the specified conditions during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all its iterations, `x` remains an integer, `i` becomes the largest integer less than or equal to `sqrt(x) + 1`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and any `i` that satisfies the conditions within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is the maximum value among all possible `i` values (from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`) that satisfy either of the two conditions within the loop, and `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `x` and `n` remain the same as their initial values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
