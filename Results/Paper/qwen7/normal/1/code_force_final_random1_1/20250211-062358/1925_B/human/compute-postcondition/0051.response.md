Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and `i`. After executing the if statement, if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` holds true, `i` is incremented by 1 and must still be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. If the condition does not hold, `i` remains unchanged and the same conditions apply.
