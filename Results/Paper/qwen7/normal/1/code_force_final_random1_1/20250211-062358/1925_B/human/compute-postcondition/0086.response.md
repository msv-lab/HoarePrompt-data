Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `x` is the same as before, `n` is the same as before, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum between its current value (`ans`) and the new value of `i` (`k + 1`). The other variables (`x` and `n`) remain unchanged.
