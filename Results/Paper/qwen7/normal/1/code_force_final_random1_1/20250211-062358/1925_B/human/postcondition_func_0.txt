The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(n\). It then finds the maximum integer \(i\) such that \(x - n \cdot i \geq 0\) and both \(x - n \cdot i\) and \(x\) are divisible by \(i\), for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(\sqrt{x}\). After processing all test cases, it prints the maximum value of \(i\) found for each test case.
