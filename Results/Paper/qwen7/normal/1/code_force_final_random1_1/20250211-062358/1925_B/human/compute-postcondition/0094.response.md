Output State: **`ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `i`, `i` is `k + 2`, `x` is the same as before, `n` is the same as before.**

This means that `ans` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `i`, which is `k + 2`. The values of `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
