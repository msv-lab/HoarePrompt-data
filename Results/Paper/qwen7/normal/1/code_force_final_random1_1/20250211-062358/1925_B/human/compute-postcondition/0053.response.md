Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to the maximum value between the current `ans` and `x // i`. Since `i` is a divisor of `x`, `x // i` is an integer. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 and must still be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, but the exact value of `i` is not specified. The precondition that `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` is not directly used here, but it ensures that `i` is a valid divisor of `x` when the condition is met. The output state reflects the updated value of `ans` and the fact that `i` is incremented.
