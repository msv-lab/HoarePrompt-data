Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer input from the user split by space, `n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `ans` is 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
            i) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` and `n` are integers input from the user. `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i` if the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is true; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `x // i` if `x % i == 0` and the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is true; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and `i` is incremented by 1 and still within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, and `i` must be within the range 1 to int(sqrt(x)) + 1; `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
