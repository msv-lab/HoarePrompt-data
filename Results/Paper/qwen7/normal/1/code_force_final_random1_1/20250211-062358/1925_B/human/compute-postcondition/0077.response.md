Output State: **`i` is an integer, `x` and `n` are integers read from input, the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, and the value of `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and is also divisible by `i`; `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `i`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. The conditions on `x` and `n` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them.
