Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and `i`. After the if-else block executes, `i` is incremented by 1 and must still be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. If `x % i == 0` and the conditions `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, `x // i > 0`, and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` are met, then `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the current `ans` and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
