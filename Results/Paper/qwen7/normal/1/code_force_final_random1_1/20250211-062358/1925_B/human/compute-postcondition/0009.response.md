Postcondition: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be a positive integer, and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `x`. The variable `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i` if the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is true; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
