Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `c1`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments by 2 each time.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(path_ba) - c1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `c1` is unchanged (no specific value given, but it remains the same).
   - `ops` now contains the tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`.

4. **Calculate the next value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.
   - Given `i` is now 3, the condition becomes `3 < len(path_ba) - c1`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` is set to 3.
   - `c1` remains unchanged.
   - `ops` does not change based on the loop head variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `c1` is unchanged, `ops` now contains the tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`**
