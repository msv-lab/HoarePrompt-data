Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `ci`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < ci + 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `ci` is 1
   - `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop condition is `i < ci + 1`, the loop will execute once more because `0 < 1 + 1` is true.
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `ci` remains unchanged at 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `ci` remains 1.
   - The state of `ops` does not change based on the loop head variables.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `ci` is 1**
