Output State: **`u` is an integer from the input split minus 1, `v` is an integer from the input split minus 1**.

Explanation: The value of `v` is decremented by 1. Since `u` was initially an integer from the input split minus 1, and `v` was an integer from the input split, now both `u` and `v` are their respective input integers minus 1.
