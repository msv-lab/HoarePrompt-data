Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, and `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. Since `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, and `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, these relationships remain unchanged. The only new information is that `b` now holds the value of `func_1(d)`.
