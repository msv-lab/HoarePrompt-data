Output State: `n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1, -1, ..., -1]` (with `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates).

Explanation: The loop continues to append `n` to `path_ba` until `n` equals `-1`. Since the condition for breaking the loop is `if n == -1`, and we know that the loop has executed at least 3 times and `n` is `-1` each time, it implies that `n` will continue to be `-1` in subsequent iterations as well. Therefore, `path_ba` will keep appending `-1` until the loop terminates, which happens when `n` finally becomes `-1` again, satisfying the loop's termination condition. Given that the loop has already executed 3 times and `n` is `-1` each time, it suggests that `n` will remain `-1` for all further iterations, making `path_ba` a list filled with `-1`s.
