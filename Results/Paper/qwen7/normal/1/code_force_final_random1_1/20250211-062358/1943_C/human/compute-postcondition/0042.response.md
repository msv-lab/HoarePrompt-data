Output State: **`n` is -1 and is appended to `path_ba`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1]`**.

Explanation: The line `path_ba.append(n)` appends the value of `n` (which is -1) to the list `path_ba`. Since the condition `if n == -1:` is met, the value of `n` remains -1 and is appended to `path_ba`. The other variables (`a`, `d`, `_`, `b`, and `path_ba`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
