Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, and `previous` is the previous node in the bfs traversal.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d` to the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, and assigns the result of the bfs function call (which returns a tuple of two values) to the variables `d` and `previous`. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it was already assigned the result of `func_1(d)` in the initial state. The variable `_` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state but not used in the current code snippet.
