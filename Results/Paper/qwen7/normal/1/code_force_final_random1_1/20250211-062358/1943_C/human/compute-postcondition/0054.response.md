Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < ci + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `ci` is 1
   - `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 1)` where `c` is the current value of `ci`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute again**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `ci` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `ci + 1`.
   - Since `i` is 1 and `ci` is 1, `i` is equal to `ci + 1` (which is 2), so the loop cannot execute again.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop cannot execute again, no changes are needed for the loop head variables `i` and `ci`.

6. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The states of `i` and `ci` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 1; `ci` is 1; `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 1)` where `c` is the current value of `ci`**.
