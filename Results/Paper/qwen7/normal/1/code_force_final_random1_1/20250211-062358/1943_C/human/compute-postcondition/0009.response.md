Output State: **`u2vs[u]` is a list containing `v`, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing both `u` and the original value of `v`, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. It does not modify the lists `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` directly, but it does add to their respective structures by including the new integer. The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
