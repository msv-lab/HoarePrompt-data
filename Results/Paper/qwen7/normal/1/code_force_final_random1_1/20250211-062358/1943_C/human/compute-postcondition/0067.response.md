Output State: **`i` is 3; `c1` is unchanged; `ops` now contains the tuples (`c1`, 3), (`c2`, 1), and (`c2`, 3)**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `c2` is equal to 1 (from the initial state), the new tuple added is `(1, 3)`. The value of `i` remains 3, and `c1` remains unchanged. Therefore, `ops` now contains the tuples (`c1`, 3) and (`c2`, 1) from the initial state plus the new tuple (`c2`, 3).
