Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `ci + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop will start with `i` being 0 (since `range(ci + 1)` generates values from 0 to `ci` inclusive).

3. **Determine the Value of `ci`**: From the given state, `ci` is 1.

4. **Calculate the Range of the Loop**: Given `ci` is 1, the range will be `range(1 + 1)`, which means `i` will take the values 0 and 1.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is 0 and that the condition `ci + 1` is satisfied. Since `ci` is 1, `ci + 1` is 2, but the loop will only iterate up to 1 (inclusive).

6. **Check the Initial State**: The initial state of `i` should be 0, and `ci` should be 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `ci`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `ci` is 1**
