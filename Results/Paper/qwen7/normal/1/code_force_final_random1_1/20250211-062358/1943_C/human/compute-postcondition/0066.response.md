Output State: **`i` is 3; `c1` is unchanged; `ops` now contains the tuples (`c1`, 3) and (`c2`, 1)**

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c1, i))` appends a new tuple to the list `ops`. Since `i` is currently 3, the tuple added is (`c1`, 3). The value of `c1` remains unchanged, and the existing tuple (`c2`, 1) in `ops` is also still present. Therefore, the updated state includes the new tuple in `ops` along with the unchanged values of `c1` and `c2`.
