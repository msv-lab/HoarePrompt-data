Output State: **`u2vs[u]` is a list containing `v` and the original value of `v`, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing both `u` and the original value of `u`, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is an integer which is 1 less than the original input integer `u`, `v` is decreased by 1 and `u2vs[v]` now contains both `u` and the original value of `u`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `u2vs[u]` contains `v` and the original value of `v`.
- `u2vs[v]` contains both `u` and the original value of `u`.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `u` is an integer which is 1 less than the original input integer `u`.
- `v` is decreased by 1.
- After executing `u2vs[v].append(u)`, `u2vs[v]` now includes `u` and its original value, making it a list containing both `u` and the original value of `u`.
