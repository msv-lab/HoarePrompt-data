Output State: **`u2vs[u]` is a list containing `v` and the original value of `v`, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing both `u` and the original value of `u`, `n` is 1, `u` is 1 less than the original input integer `u`, `v` is the integer input after decrementing by 3, and `u2vs[u]` is updated to include `v`.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `u2vs[u]`. Initially, `u2vs[u]` contains `v` and the original value of `v`. After appending `v`, `u2vs[u]` now contains `v` twice (both the new and the original value). The values of `u2vs[v]`, `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states.
