Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b]`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is -1; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1]` and `n` is appended to `path_ba`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is -1 and is appended to `path_ba`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1]`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
