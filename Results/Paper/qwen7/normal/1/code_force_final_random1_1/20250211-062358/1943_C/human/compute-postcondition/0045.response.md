Output State: **`n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1, -1, -1]`.**

Explanation: The provided code initializes an empty list `ops`. However, this line does not affect any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. The loop and conditions described in the initial state remain unchanged. Since the loop has already appended `-1` three times to `path_ba` and the condition `if n == -1` is met, `path_ba` will no longer change. Therefore, the final state of `path_ba` is `[b, -1, -1, -1]`, and `n` remains `-1`.
