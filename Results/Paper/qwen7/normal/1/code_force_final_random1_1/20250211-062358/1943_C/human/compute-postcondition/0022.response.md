Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = func_1(d)` assigns the result of calling the function `func_1` with the argument `d` to the variable `a`. The values of `d` and `_` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `a` and retains the original values of `d` and `_`.
