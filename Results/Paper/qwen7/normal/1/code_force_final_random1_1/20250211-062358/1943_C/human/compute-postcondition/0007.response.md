Output State: **`u2vs[u]` is a list containing `v`, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now contains both `u` and the original value of `v`.**

Explanation: The code appends `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`. Initially, `u2vs[v]` contains only `v`. After executing the code, `u2vs[v]` will contain both `v` and `u`. The other variables remain unchanged.
