The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least one more time regardless of the current state of the variables.

Since the loop head does not depend on any specific variables, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1]` and `n` is appended to `path_ba`**
