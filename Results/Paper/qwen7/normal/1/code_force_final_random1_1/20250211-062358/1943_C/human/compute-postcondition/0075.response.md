Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is either 1 or 6.
   - `ci` is either 1 or unchanged.
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples.

2. **Conditions for `ops`:**
   - If `len(path_ba)` is odd, then:
     - `i` is 1.
     - `ci` is 1.
     - `ops` is a list containing three tuples: \[(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)\].
   - Otherwise:
     - `i` is 6.
     - `ci` is unchanged.
     - `ops` contains the tuples: \[(c1, 3), (c2, 1), (c2, 3), (c1, 5), (c2, 5), (c1, 7), (c2, 7)\], where `c1` and `c2` are the values they had before the loop.

3. **Determine `ops` based on the value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is either 1 or 6, let's consider both cases:
     - If `i` is 1, then `ops` is \[(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)\].
     - If `i` is 6, then `ops` is \[(c1, 3), (c2, 1), (c2, 3), (c1, 5), (c2, 5), (c1, 7), (c2, 7)\].

4. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`.
   - The lambda function formats each tuple `(x, y)` into a string `f'{x + 1} {y}'`.
   - The result is printed with each formatted string on a new line using `sep='\n'`.

5. **Calculate the Output:**
   - If `i` is 1:
     - `ops` is \[(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)\].
     - The lambda function applied to each tuple results in:
       - \((1, 1) \rightarrow f'{1 + 1} {1}' = '2 1'\)
       - \((1, 1) \rightarrow f'{1 + 1} {1}' = '2 1'\)
       - \((1, 1) \rightarrow f'{1 + 1} {1}' = '2 1'\)
     - The output will be:
       ```
       2 1
       2 1
       2 1
       ```
   - If `i` is 6:
     - `ops` is \[(c1, 3), (c2, 1), (c2, 3), (c1, 5), (c2, 5), (c1, 7), (c2, 7)\].
     - The lambda function applied to each tuple results in:
       - \((c1, 3) \rightarrow f'{c1 + 1} {3}' = f'{c1 + 1} 3'\)
       - \((c2, 1) \rightarrow f'{c2 + 1} {1}' = f'{c2 + 1} 1'\)
       - \((c2, 3) \rightarrow f'{c2 + 1} {3}' = f'{c2 + 1} 3'\)
       - \((c1, 5) \rightarrow f'{c1 + 1} {5}' = f'{c1 + 1} 5'\)
       - \((c2, 5) \rightarrow f'{c2 + 1} {5}' = f'{c2 + 1} 5'\)
       - \((c1, 7) \rightarrow f'{c1 + 1} {7}' = f'{c1 + 1} 7'\)
       - \((c2, 7) \rightarrow f'{c2 + 1} {7}' = f'{c2 + 1} 7'\)
     - The output will be:
       ```
       {c1 + 1} 3
       {c2 + 1} 1
       {c2 + 1} 3
       {c1 + 1} 5
       {c2 + 1} 5
       {c1 + 1} 7
       {c2 + 1} 7
       ```

Given that `i` is either 1 or 6, and since the problem does not specify which case applies, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the most precise answer based on the given conditions is:

Output: **2 1\n2 1\n2 1** (if `i` is 1) or **{c1 + 1} 3\n{c2 + 1} 1\n{c2 + 1} 3\n{c1 + 1} 5\n{c2 + 1} 5\n{c1 + 1} 7\n{c2 + 1} 7** (if `i` is 6).
