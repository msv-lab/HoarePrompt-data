Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tc` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is updated from user input, `dp` is True, `n` is now the length of `arr` minus 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` must be at least 1, `i` is now within the range [1, n-1], `n` is now at least 2, `arr` is updated from user input, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `dp` is a boolean value determined by `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the current `dp` value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `dp` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or not the previous value of `dp`; `i` is 3; `n` must be greater than 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
