Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to `n`.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This means `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n`.

4. **Check the initial value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to `n`, and `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `i` starts at the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be at least 1. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1.

5. **Ensure the loop can execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `i` is in the range `[1, n]`. Given that `i` starts at `n` and decreases, the loop will run as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` must be at least 1 for the loop to start.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for `i` to be in the valid range.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is at least 1, `n` is at least 1**
