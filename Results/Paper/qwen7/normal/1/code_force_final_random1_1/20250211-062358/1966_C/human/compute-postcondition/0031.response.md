The loop head is `while tc > 0`, which means the loop can execute as long as `tc` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` is at least 0. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `tc` is greater than 0.

State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `dp` is a boolean value determined by the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the previous value of `dp` for every `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, inclusive.**
