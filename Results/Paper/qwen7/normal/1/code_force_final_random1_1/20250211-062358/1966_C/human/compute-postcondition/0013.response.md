Output State: `tc` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of integers in descending order with 0 appended as the last element, `dp` is the result of applying the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` iteratively from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, which is the second-to-last index of the list `arr`. The variable `dp` will hold the final boolean value determined by applying the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` for each iteration of the loop, starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n-1`.
