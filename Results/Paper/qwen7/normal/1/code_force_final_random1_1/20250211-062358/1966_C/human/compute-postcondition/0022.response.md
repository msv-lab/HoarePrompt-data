Output State: **`tc` must be at least 1, `i` is now within the range [1, n-1], `n` is now at least 2, `arr` is updated from user input, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp` based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Since `i` is within the range `[1, n-1]`, `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` are valid indices for the array `arr`. The value of `dp` is now determined by the expression `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. All other variables (`tc`, `i`, `n`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
