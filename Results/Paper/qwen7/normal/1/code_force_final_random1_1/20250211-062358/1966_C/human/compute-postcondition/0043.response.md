Output State: `dp` will be the result of evaluating the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` or not `dp`, `i` will be `n-1`, `n` remains at least 1.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `dp` will hold the final boolean value determined by evaluating the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` or the negation of the previous value of `dp`. The variable `i` will be set to `n-1`, indicating the last iteration of the loop. The variable `n` remains at least 1, as it was initialized and has not been modified within the loop.
