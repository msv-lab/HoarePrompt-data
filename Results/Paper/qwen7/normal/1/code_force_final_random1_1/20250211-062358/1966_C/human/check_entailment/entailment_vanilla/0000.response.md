Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program sorts the unique pile sizes in descending order and appends a zero.
   - This sorting and appending are unnecessary because the logic doesn't rely on the order of the elements after the first one.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic:**
   - The variable `dp` is initialized to `True`.
   - The loop iterates through the array starting from index 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each element, it checks if the difference between the current element and the next element is greater than 1 or if `dp` is `False`.
   - The result of this check is assigned back to `dp`.

4. **Determining the Winner:**
   - If `dp` is `True` after the loop, it prints "Alice".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Bob".

### Correctness Analysis:

#### Problem Understanding:
- The game involves removing the same number of stones from all non-empty piles simultaneously.
- A player loses when they cannot make a move (i.e., all piles are empty).
- Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move.

#### Key Insight:
- The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes).
- If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy.
- If the Nim-sum is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program attempts to use a dynamic programming approach to determine the winner.
- However, the logic used in the loop is flawed and does not correctly implement the Nim-sum strategy.

### Example Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Piles: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`
   - Nim-sum: \(3 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 = 0\)
   - Expected Output: "Bob"

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Piles: `[1, 7]`
   - Nim-sum: \(1 \oplus 7 = 6\)
   - Expected Output: "Alice"

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Piles: `[1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]`
   - Nim-sum: \(1 \oplus 3 \oplus 9 \oplus 7 \oplus 4 \oplus 2 \oplus 100 = 100\)
   - Expected Output: "Alice"

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Piles: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Nim-sum: \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0\)
   - Expected Output: "Bob"

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the Nim-sum strategy to determine the winner. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
