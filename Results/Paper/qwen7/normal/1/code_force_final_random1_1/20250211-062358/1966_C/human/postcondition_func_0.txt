The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It then sorts these integers in descending order, appends a zero at the end, and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1 or if the previous result was false. Based on this check, it prints either "Alice" or "Bob". After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the number of test cases processed (`tc`) is zero.
