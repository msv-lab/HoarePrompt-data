Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `dp` is True, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order followed by 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `n` to the length of the list `arr` minus 1. This means `n` now holds the index of the last element in the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
