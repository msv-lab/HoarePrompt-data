Output State: **`tc` is at least 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `dp` is a boolean value determined by the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the previous value of `dp` for every `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `tc -= 1` decrements the value of `tc` by 1. Since `tc` must be at least 1 initially, after decrementing, `tc` will be at least 0. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `dp`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
