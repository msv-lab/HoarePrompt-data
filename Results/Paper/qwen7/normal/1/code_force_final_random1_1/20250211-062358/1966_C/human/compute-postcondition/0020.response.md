Output State: **`tc` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is updated from user input, `dp` is True, `n` is now the length of `arr` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(arr) - 1` calculates the length of the list `arr` and subtracts 1 from it, assigning the result to the variable `n`. This means that `n` is now updated to the length of `arr` minus 1. All other variables (`tc`, `i`, `arr`, and `dp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
