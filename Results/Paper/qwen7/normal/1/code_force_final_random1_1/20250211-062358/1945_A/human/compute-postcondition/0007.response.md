Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - There are exactly `t` lines of input, each containing three non-negative integers separated by spaces.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting the third line of input.
   - `b` is increased by `c`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The expression inside the `print` function is a tuple `(a - -b // 3, -1)`.
   - The second element of this tuple is `-1`.
   - The first element of the tuple is `a - -b // 3`.
   - The condition `c < b % 3` determines which element of the tuple will be printed.

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - `b % 3` gives the remainder when `b` is divided by 3.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, then the element at index 0 of the tuple will be printed.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, then the element at index 1 of the tuple will be printed, which is `-1`.

5. **Possible Values**:
   - Since `b` is increased by `c`, `b` could be any non-negative integer.
   - `b % 3` can be 0, 1, or 2.
   - Therefore, `c < b % 3` can be either `True` or `False`.

6. **Final Output**:
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the output will be `a - -b // 3`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the output will be `-1`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **a - -b // 3 if c < b % 3 else -1**
