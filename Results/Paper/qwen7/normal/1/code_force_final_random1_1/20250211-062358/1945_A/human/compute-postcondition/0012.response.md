Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and there are exactly `t` lines of input processed. For each line, `a` is the first integer, `b` is the second integer plus the third integer, and `c` is the third integer. The loop processes each line sequentially, updating `b` by adding `c` and printing the result of `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` for each line.**

This means that after all iterations, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each line will be used in the print statement to produce the output, with `b` being updated by adding `c` for each line.
