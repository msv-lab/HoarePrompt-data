Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and there are exactly `t` lines of input, each containing three non-negative integers separated by spaces; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting the third line of input; `b` is increased by `c`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, s.split())` takes the third line of input (stored in `s`), splits it into three parts, and converts them into integers. These integers are then assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. After this assignment, `b` is increased by the value of `c`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the precondition about the number of lines of input and their format also remains valid.
