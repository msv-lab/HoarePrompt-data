Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and there are exactly `t` lines of input, each containing three non-negative integers separated by spaces; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting the third line of input; `b` is increased by `c`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b += c` increases the value of `b` by the value of `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions and the structure of the input remain the same.
