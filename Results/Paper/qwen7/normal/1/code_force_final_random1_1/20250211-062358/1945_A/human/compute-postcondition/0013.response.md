Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, if the number of introverts (a) and extroverts (b) is within the range 1 to 10^4, and the number of universals (c) is within the range 0 to 10^9, the function returns the count of valid test cases. Otherwise, it returns an error message indicating that the test case is invalid.**
