Output State: **`i` is 2 * `n` - 1, `score` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `score` to 0. It does not affect the values of `i` or `l`. Therefore, `i` remains as `2 * n - 1`, `score` is now 0, and `l` remains as a sorted list of integers entered by the user.
