Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `score` is the original `score` plus `l[0]`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 0 up to `2 * n` (exclusive) with a step of 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

4. **Calculate the value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be `1 + 2 = 3`.

5. **Determine the value of `n`**:
   - We know that `i` must be less than `2 * n` for the loop to continue.
   - Since `i` is now 3, `2 * n` must be greater than 3.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.5, which means `n` must be at least 2 (since `n` is typically an integer).

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.5, so we can say `n` must be at least 2.

7. **Final state**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `score` remains the original `score` plus `l[0]` because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `score` in the given context.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `score` is the original `score` plus `l[0]`, `n` must be at least 2**
