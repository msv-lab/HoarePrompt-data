Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to `2 * n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `score` is the original `score` plus the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2 * (n - 1).

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the value of `score`.

The value of `score` is the original `score` plus the sum of elements at even indices in the list `l`. Specifically, these indices are 0, 2, 4, ..., 2 * (n - 1).

Since the exact list `l` and the original value of `score` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `score` in terms of the sum of elements at even indices of `l`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **score (where score is the original score plus the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2 * (n - 1) in the list l)**
