Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest two numbers available on the whiteboard. Since the list is sorted, the smallest two numbers at each iteration are `l[i]` and `l[i+1]`, and their minimum is added to the score. This ensures that the score is maximized because the sum of the smallest elements is always greater than or equal to the sum of any other pair of elements. The program handles all given examples and potential cases as described in the problem statement.
