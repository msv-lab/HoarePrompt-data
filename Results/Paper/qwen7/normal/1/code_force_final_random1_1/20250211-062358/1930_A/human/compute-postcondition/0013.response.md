Based on the initial state provided, the value of `score` is the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element, up to the last element that can be accessed within the loop's range. This means `score` is the sum of `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, ..., `l[2*n-2]`, where `n` is the number of such elements in the list `l`.

Given this, the print statement will output the value of `score`, which is the sum of the even-indexed elements in the list `l`.

Output: **score (where score is the sum of all even-indexed elements in the list l)**
