Output State: **`i` is 3; `score` is the original `score` plus `l[3]`; `n` must be at least 2**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `score` is updated to its original value plus `l[3]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and still must be at least 2.
