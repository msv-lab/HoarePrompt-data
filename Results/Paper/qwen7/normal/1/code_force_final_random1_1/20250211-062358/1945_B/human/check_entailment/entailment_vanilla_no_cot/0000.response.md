Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in its calculation of the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The current logic calculates the sum of the divisions of `mn` by `a` and `b`, which does not correctly account for the overlaps and simultaneous visibility of fireworks from both installations.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. The LCM will give us the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. We should then calculate how many fireworks can be visible within that interval, considering their visibility period `m + 1`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks visible at any given time
        # The number of intervals of length lcm_ab that fit into the visibility period m + 1
        max_visible = (m + 1) // lcm_ab
        
        # Each interval can have fireworks from both installations, plus the initial overlap
        total_visible = 2 * max_visible - 1
        
        print(total_visible)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected function uses the least common multiple (LCM) to determine the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously and calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen at the same time.
