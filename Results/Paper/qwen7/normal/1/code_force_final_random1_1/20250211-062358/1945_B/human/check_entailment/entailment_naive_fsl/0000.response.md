Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Specifically, the logic used to calculate `mn` and the subsequent division operations do not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
6 7 4
```
- The first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes.
- The second installation launches fireworks every 7 minutes.
- Each firework is visible for 5 minutes after launch.

According to the problem description, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` plus `m` to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. However, the current implementation does not correctly compute the LCM.

A correct approach would involve calculating the LCM of `a` and `b` and then using it to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        max_visible = lcm_ab // a + lcm_ab // b - 1
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected version uses the least common multiple (LCM) to ensure that the calculation reflects the actual maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
