Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
3. It calculates `mn` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
4. The logic to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is as follows:
   - If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, the formula used is `(mn // a) + (mn // b) + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the formula used is `(mn // a) + (mn // b)`.
5. This logic is based on the principle that the number of fireworks visible at any given time is the sum of the number of fireworks from each installation that are currently in the sky, considering their periodicity and visibility duration.
6. The program does not retain any state between test cases, which is appropriate since the inputs are independent of each other.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
