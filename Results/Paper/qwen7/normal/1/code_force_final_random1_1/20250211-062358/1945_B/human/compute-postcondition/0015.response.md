Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
