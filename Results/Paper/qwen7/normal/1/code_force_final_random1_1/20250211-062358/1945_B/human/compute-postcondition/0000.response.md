Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and now `t` is set to the integer value entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, after executing the code, `t` will hold the integer value entered by the user, which must still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
