### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It calculates `mn = min(a, b) + m`.
   - If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is indeed flawed.
   - The formula `mn // a + mn // b + 1` does not correctly account for the overlapping visibility period of fireworks from both installations.
   - The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is unnecessary and incorrect for determining the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM of `a` and `b` gives us the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
   - The number of fireworks visible at any given time is the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the interval plus one additional firework for the overlap.

5. **Correct Formula:**
   - The correct formula should be: `LCM(a, b) // a + LCM(a, b) // b - 1`.

6. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary mentions that the function calculates a value based on the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`, and prints either \(\frac{mn}{a} + \frac{mn}{b} + 1\) or \(\frac{mn}{a} + \frac{mn}{b}\) depending on certain conditions.
   - This summary does not accurately reflect the intended logic for finding the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. The provided solution uses an incorrect approach and formula, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Answer:
