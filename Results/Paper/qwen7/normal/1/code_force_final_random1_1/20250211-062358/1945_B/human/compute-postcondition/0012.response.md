Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `mn` is the minimum of `a` (updated to the first input integer) and `b` (updated to the second input integer) plus `m` (updated to the third input integer)**.

Explanation: The code updates `a`, `b`, and `m` to the values of the first, second, and third input integers, respectively. It then calculates `mn` as the minimum of the updated `a` and `b` plus the updated `m`. The conditions and values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
