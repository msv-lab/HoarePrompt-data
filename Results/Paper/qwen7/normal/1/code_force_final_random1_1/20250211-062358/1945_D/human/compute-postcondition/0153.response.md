Output State: **`total` is 10, `best` is 10, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `v` is equal to `na_frente`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Given the initial state, `total` is 0, and since `v` is equal to `na_frente`, `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is added to `total`. The problem statement mentions that `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, but this does not affect the calculation of `total`. The value of `total` becomes 10, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
