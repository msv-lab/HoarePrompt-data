Output State: **`total` is incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is either updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, or remains 10, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `v` is now `v - 1` and less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other variables (`best`, `na_frente`, and `v`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions and constraints. `v` is updated to `v - 1` and still needs to satisfy the condition of being less than or equal to `pos_final`. The value of `best` may have been updated if the new value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current `best`, but if it is not, `best` remains 10.
