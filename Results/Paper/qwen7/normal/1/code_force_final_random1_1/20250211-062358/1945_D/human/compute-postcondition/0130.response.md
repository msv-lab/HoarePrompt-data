Output State: **`v` is -1, `best` is the maximum value between 10 and the accumulated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` from the previous iteration, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is 0, and `pos_final` is an input integer - 1; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `pos_final -= 1` decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
