Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `custo` is the sum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, depending on whether `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to `b_values[y]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it means that the loop or conditional block that was calculating the value of `custo` has been exited. The values of `y` and `custo` remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not modify these variables.
