Postcondition: `custo` is an integer plus the value of `b_values[y]`, `y` is one less than the final value of `custo`. If `y` equals 1, then `custo` is incremented by `a_values[0]` and `y` is updated to one less than the new final value of `custo`. If `y` does not equal 1, then no changes are made to `custo` and `y` remains as one less than the final value of `custo`.
