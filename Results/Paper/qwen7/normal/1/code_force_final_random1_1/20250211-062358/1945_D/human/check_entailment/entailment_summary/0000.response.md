Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.
2. It properly extracts the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case and adjusts them to zero-based indices.
3. The program initializes variables to keep track of the total cost and the best cost found so far.
4. It iterates backward through the positions from \(na_frente\) to 0, calculating the minimum cost to reach or stay within the allowed final position \(pos_final\).
5. At each position, it checks whether moving to a previous position (using \(a_i\)) or staying in the current position (using \(b_i\)) is cheaper and updates the total cost accordingly.
6. The logic ensures that the cost is minimized while ensuring Kirill ends up in a position no worse than \(pos_final\).
7. The program correctly prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Given the execution summary and the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
