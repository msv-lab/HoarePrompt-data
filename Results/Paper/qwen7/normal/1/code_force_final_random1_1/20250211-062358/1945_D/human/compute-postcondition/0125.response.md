Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for c in range(cases)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `c` and `cases`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over the range defined by `cases`. The variable `c` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `cases - 1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `v` is -1.
   - `best` is updated to the maximum value between 10 and the accumulated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
   - `na_frente` is less than or equal to -1.
   - `total` is the cumulative cost based on the conditions specified in the loop body.

4. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `c` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `c` will be 0 if it was -1 at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `cases` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `v` will remain -1 because the loop does not change the value of `v`.
   - `best` will be the maximum value between its initial value of 10 and any updated values during the loop. Since the loop is about to start, `best` will still hold the value from the previous iteration.
   - `na_frente` will remain less than or equal to -1 because the loop does not change the value of `na_frente`.
   - `total` will be the cumulative cost based on the conditions specified in the loop body, but since the loop is about to start, `total` will be reset to 0 for the new iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`v` is -1, `best` is the maximum value between 10 and the accumulated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` from the previous iteration, `na_frente` is less than or equal to -1, and `total` is 0**.
