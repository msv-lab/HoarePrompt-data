Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two positive integers \(n\) and \(m\), and two lists of \(n\) positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost to move from position \(na_frente\) to position \(pos_final\) using either the cost from list \(a\) or list \(b\), depending on which is cheaper at each step. The function then prints the minimum cost found for each test case.**
