Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, and the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are still valid.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input for the number of test cases, which is stored in the variable `cases`. However, it does not affect the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, which remain as specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cases` and retains the original conditions for the other variables.
