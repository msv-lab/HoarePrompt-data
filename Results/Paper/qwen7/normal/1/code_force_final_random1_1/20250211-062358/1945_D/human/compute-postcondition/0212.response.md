Output State: **`y` is 1, `y` must be greater than or equal to 0, `custo` is the sum of `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to 0 plus `a_values[0]`, and `a_values[0] + b_values[1]` is less than or equal to `a_values[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[0]` adds the value of `a_values[0]` to the current value of `custo`. Given the initial conditions, `y` is 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0. The value of `custo` is updated to include `a_values[0]`. The condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]` remains valid for `y = 1`, which translates to `a_values[0] + b_values[1]` being less than or equal to `a_values[1]`.
