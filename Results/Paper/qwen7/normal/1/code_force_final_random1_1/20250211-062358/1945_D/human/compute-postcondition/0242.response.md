Output State: **`custos` is a list containing the final value of `custo` after the loop has completed, and `custo` is the total accumulated cost based on the specified conditions over all iterations of the loop until `y` is no longer greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the final value of `custo` to the list `custos`. This means that `custos` now contains the last computed value of `custo` after the loop has finished executing. The value of `custo` itself remains unchanged after the append operation, as it is only updated within the loop. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `custos` list and the final value of `custo` which is the total accumulated cost.
