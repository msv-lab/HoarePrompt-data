Output State: **`v` is `v - 1`; `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `total` are unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `best` is updated to be the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The values of `v`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `total` remain unchanged from their initial states.
