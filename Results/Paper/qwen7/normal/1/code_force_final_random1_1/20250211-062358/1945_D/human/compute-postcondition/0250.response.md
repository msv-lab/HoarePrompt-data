Based on the initial state provided, `custos` must contain at least one element. However, no specific value or further details about `custos` are given. Since `c` is not defined in the initial state and there's no context suggesting what `c` might be, we can only conclude that `c` is not explicitly defined or initialized with any value in the given information.

Given this, we cannot determine the exact value of `c` to print. Therefore, the output will be undefined based on the provided information.

Output: **undefined**
