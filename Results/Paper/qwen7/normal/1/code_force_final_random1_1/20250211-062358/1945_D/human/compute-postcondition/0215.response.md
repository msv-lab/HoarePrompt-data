Postcondition: `y` is `max_p - 1`, `y` must be greater than or equal to 0, `custo` is the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, depending on whether `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, and `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`.
