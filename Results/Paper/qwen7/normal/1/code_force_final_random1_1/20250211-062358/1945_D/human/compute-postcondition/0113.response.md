Postcondition: **`v` is -3, `na_frente` must be greater than -1, `best` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-3]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[-3]` depending on whether `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-3]`, and `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[-3]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[-3]` accordingly.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. If the condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is true, then `v` becomes `-3`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-3]` if this value is greater than the current `best`, and `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-3]`. If the condition is false, the state remains unchanged.
