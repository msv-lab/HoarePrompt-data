Postcondition: `custo` is an integer, and `y` is one less than its final value after the if-else block. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is true, then `custo` is incremented by the value of `b_values[y]`, and `y` is updated to one less than the new value of `custo`. If `y` equals 1, `custo` is further incremented by `a_values[0]`. If the condition is false, `custo` is incremented by `a_values[y]`, `y` is updated to one less than the new value of `custo`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
