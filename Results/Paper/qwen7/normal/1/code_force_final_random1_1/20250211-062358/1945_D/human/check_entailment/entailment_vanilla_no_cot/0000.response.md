Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes necessary variables like `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total`, and `best`.
3. **Iterative Calculation**: The program iterates backward from the last person to the first, calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the allowed range (`m`).
4. **Cost Calculation**: For each position, it checks whether moving Kirill to that position directly or passing through intermediate positions would incur less cost.
5. **Updating Best Cost**: It updates the `best` cost to ensure that the minimum cost is tracked correctly.
6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the minimum cost for each test case.

The logic and flow of the program align with the problem statement and correctly computes the required result. Therefore, the given program is correct.
