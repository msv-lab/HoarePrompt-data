Output State: **`custo` is the value of `custo` plus `a_values[0]`, `y` is one less than the final value of `custo` plus the value of `b_values[y]`**.

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[0]` increments the value of `custo` by the value of `a_values[0]`. The value of `y` remains unchanged as it was set to be one less than the final value of `custo` before the increment operation. Therefore, `y` is still one less than the new value of `custo`.
