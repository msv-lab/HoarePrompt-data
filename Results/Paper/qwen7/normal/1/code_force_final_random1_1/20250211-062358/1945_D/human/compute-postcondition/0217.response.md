Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `custo` is the sum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, depending on whether `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to `b_values[y]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `custo += a_values[y]` increments the value of `custo` by `a_values[y]`. Given the initial state, `y` is `max_p - 1`, and `custo` is the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the specified range, depending on the condition. After executing the code, `custo` is updated to include `a_values[y]` for the current `y`. The value of `y` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
