Output State: **`total` is incremented by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is either updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, or remains 10, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `v` is now `v - 1` and less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables (`best`, `na_frente`, and `v`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions or constraints. The value of `v` is updated to `v - 1`, and it still needs to satisfy the condition of being greater than or equal to -1 and less than or equal to `pos_final`.
