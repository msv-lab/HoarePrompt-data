Output State: **`custo` is an integer increased by `a_values[y]`, `y` is one less than the new value of `custo`.**

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[y]` increases the value of `custo` by `a_values[y]`. Since `y` is defined as being one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, after the increment, `y` will be updated to be one less than the new value of `custo`. The exact values of `a_values[y]` and the updated `custo` depend on the initial state and the specific values within `a_values`, but the relationships between the variables are as described.
