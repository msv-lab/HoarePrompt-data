Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `v` and `na_frente`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `na_frente` to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `v` starts at `na_frente` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Determine the new state of `v`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was decremented by 1, so `v` is now `v - 1`.

4. **Check the loop continuation condition**: For the loop to continue executing, `v` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `v` is now `v - 1`.
   - `na_frente` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, it stays the same.
   - The postconditions related to `total`, `best`, and `na_frente` being greater than or equal to `-1` are already satisfied by the loop's condition.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `v` and `na_frente`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is incremented by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `v` is now `v - 1` and greater than or equal to -1**.
