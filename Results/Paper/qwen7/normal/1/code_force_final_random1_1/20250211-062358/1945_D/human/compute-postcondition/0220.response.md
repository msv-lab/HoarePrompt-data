Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable `y` is the only variable in the loop head.

2. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop iterates over `y` in the range from `max_p - 1` down to `1`.

3. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and `custo` is calculated based on the values of `a_values` and `b_values` as described.

4. **Determine the next value of `y`**: Since the loop is iterating in reverse (from `max_p - 1` down to `1`), the next value of `y` would be `y - 1`.

5. **Adjust the state of `custo`**: The value of `custo` needs to be recalculated based on the new value of `y`. 

Given these points, let's adjust the state:

- If `y` was `max_p - 1` in the previous iteration, the next value of `y` will be `max_p - 2`.
- If `y` was 1 in the previous iteration, the next value of `y` will be 0.

Since the loop starts from `max_p - 1` and goes down to `1`, the next value of `y` will be `max_p - 2` if it was `max_p - 1` previously. For the purpose of adjusting the state, we need to consider the general case where `y` decreases by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`y` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `custo` is the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2`, depending on whether `a_values[y]` is less than or equal to `b_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is the sum of `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to 0 plus `a_values[0]`. If `y` is `max_p - 2`, `custo` is the sum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2`.**
