Output State: **`v` is an integer less than or equal to `pos_final`; `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`**.

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v` remains an integer less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` remains greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` remains less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
