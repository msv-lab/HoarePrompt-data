Output State: **`total` is either incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `v` is now `v - 1` and less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `best` variable to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if this new value is less than the current `best`. The other variables (`total`, `na_frente`, and `v`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The value of `v` is decremented by 1.
