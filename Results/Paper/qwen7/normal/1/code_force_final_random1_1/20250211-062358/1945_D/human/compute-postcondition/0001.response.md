Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head: The loop head is `for c in range(cases)`.
   - The variable `c` is being initialized and incremented within this loop.
   - The variable `cases` is used as the upper bound for the range.

2. Determine which states need to be adjusted:
   - The variable `c` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
   - The variable `cases` determines how many times the loop will run. It must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

3. Consider the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`:
   - These variables are mentioned as having "initial conditions," but they are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop's execution.

4. Formulate the final state:
   - `c` should be set to 0.
   - `cases` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `c` and `cases`.

State: **`c` is 0, `cases` must be greater than 0**
