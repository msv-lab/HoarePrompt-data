Postcondition: **`v` is -3, `na_frente` must be greater than -1, `best` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[-2]` depending on whether `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]`, and `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[-3]` accordingly.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. It indicates that `v` is now `-3`, `na_frente` remains greater than `-1`, `best` is updated based on the minimum cost between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` and `total + custo_pra_passar_b[-2]`, and `total` is increased by the chosen cost (`custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[-3]`).
