Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, m, a, and b, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, n and m are positive integers with 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and a and b are lists of n integers each, with each element in the lists ranging from 1 to 10^9. The function returns a value based on the processing of these inputs.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a series of test cases defined by the variables t, n, m, a, and b, and returns a result after processing these inputs according to the specified constraints.
