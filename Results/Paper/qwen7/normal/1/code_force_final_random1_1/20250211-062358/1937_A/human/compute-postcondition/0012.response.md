Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `n` is log2(n_cases), `power` is 3**.

Explanation: The initial state includes that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `n` is log2(n_cases), and `power` is 2. The code `power += 1` increments the value of `power` by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
