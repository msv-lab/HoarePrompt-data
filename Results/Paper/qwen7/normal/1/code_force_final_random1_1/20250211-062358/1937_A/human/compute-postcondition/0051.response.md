Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 1 if `n` is 1, otherwise `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `n` is 1 if `n_cases` must be 1, otherwise `n` is greater than 8 and `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\), and `power` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `power = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `power`. This changes the value of `power` from its previous state (which was 4 if `n` is 1, otherwise 8) to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
