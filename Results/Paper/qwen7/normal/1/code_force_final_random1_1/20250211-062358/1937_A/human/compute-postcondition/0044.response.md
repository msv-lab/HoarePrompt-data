Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n_cases` is an input integer (not used in the print statement)
- `i` is 3 (not used in the print statement)
- `n` is greater than 7 (not used in the print statement)
- `power` is 7

The print statement is:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

Here, `power` is explicitly given as 7. Therefore, the expression `2 ** power` evaluates to \(2^7\).

Calculating \(2^7\):
\[2^7 = 128\]

So, the print statement will output the value 128.

Output: **128**
