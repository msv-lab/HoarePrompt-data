The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, `power`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is an input integer.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is 1 if `n` equals 1, otherwise `n_cases` must be greater than 8 and `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\).
- `power` is 4 if `power` equals `n`, otherwise `power` is 3.

After executing the code, the value of `n` is updated to the integer input, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `n` is 1 if `n` equals 1, otherwise `n_cases` must be greater than 8 and `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\), and `power` is 4 if `power` equals `n`, otherwise `power` is 3; `n` is the integer input.**
