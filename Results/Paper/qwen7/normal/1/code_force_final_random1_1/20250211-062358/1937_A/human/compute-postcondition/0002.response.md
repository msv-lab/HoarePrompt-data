Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of `t`, `n_cases`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
