Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `n`, `n` is 1 if `n` equals 1, otherwise `n_cases` must be greater than 8 and `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\), and `power` is 4 if `power` equals `n`, otherwise `power` is 3; `n` is the integer input. If `n` is 1, `i` remains 2 and `power` is 4. Otherwise, `i` becomes 3, `n` is greater than 7, and `power` is 8.**
