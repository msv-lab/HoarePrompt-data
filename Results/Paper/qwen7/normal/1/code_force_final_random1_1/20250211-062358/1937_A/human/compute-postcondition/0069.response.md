Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is the total number of cases processed (equal to `n_cases`), `n` is the last input integer processed, and `power` is the final value determined based on the last `n` processed.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n_cases`, indicating that all cases have been processed. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last input integer processed. The variable `power` will be set to the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n` if `n` is not 1, or it will be set to 4 if `n` is 1. All other variables from the initial state will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
