Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n_cases`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n_cases`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is 1 if `n` equals 1, otherwise `n_cases` must be greater than 8 and `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\).
   - `power` is 4 if `power` equals `n`, otherwise `power` is 3.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n_cases`. Therefore, `n_cases` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n_cases` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (either 1 or \(\log_2(n_cases)\) depending on the value of `n_cases`).
   - `power` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (either 4 or 3).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `n` is 1 if `n` equals 1, otherwise `n_cases` must be greater than 8 and `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\), and `power` is 4 if `power` equals `n`, otherwise `power` is 3.**
