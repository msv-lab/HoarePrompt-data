The code snippet `n = log2(n)` is applied to the variable `n`. Given the initial conditions, `n` is either 1 if `n_cases` is 1, or greater than 8 and equal to \(\log_2(n_cases)\) otherwise. Since `n` is defined as \(\log_2(n_cases)\) when `n_cases` is not 1, we will consider the case where `n_cases` is not 1 (as the case where `n_cases` is 1 would make `n` equal to 1, which does not fit the condition of being greater than 8).

For the case where `n_cases` is not 1, `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\) and is greater than 8. Applying the code `n = log2(n)` means that `n` is now the base-2 logarithm of itself. Since `n` is already \(\log_2(n_cases)\), taking the base-2 logarithm of `n` will give us the exponent to which 2 must be raised to get `n`. In other words, `n` becomes the value of \(\log_2(\log_2(n_cases))\).

The other variables remain unchanged: `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` remains an input integer, `i` is 1 if `n` is 1, otherwise `i` is 2, and `power` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 2 because `n` is \(\log_2(\log_2(n_cases))\) and is greater than 1, `n` is \(\log_2(\log_2(n_cases))\), and `power` is 1.**
