The function accepts a list of integers and an integer representing the length of the list. It processes the list by reducing certain elements based on their neighbors, ensuring that `list[1]` becomes 0 and `list[2]` and `list[3]` become -3. If `func_1(list, n)` returns False, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. Regardless of the outcome, the final state of the list is `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is -3, and `list[3]` is -3.
