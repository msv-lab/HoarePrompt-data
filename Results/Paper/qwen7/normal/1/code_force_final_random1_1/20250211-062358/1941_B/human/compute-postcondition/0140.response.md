Output: **YES**

Explanation: The print statement simply outputs the string 'YES'. No other variables or objects are involved in this print statement, so their values do not affect the output. The values of `stop`, `i`, `opNum`, `a`, `numTest`, `a[len(a) - 1]`, and `a[len(a) - 2]` are provided but they are not used in the print statement.
