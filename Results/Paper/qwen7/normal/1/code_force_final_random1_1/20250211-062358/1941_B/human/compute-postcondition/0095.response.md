Output: **YES**

Explanation:
Based on the initial state provided, the print statement `print('YES')` simply outputs the string `'YES'`. No other variables or objects need to be evaluated since the print statement does not depend on any of them. The values of `stop`, `i`, `opNum`, `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, `a[i + 2]`, `numTest`, `a[len(a) - 1]`, and `a[len(a) - 2]` are not required to determine the output of this specific print statement.
