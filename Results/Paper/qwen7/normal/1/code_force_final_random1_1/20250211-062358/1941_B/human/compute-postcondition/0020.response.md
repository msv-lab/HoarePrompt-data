Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter and converting each element to integer**.

Explanation: The code takes a string input, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and then converts each string in the list to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The original values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged, while `b` is updated to a list of integers derived from the input string.
