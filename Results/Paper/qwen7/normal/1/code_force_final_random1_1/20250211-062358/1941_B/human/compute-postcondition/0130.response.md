Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `5`, `opNum` is `a[5] - 2 * opNum`, `a[5]` is `a[5] - 2 * opNum`, `a[6]` is `a[6] - 2 * opNum`, `a[7]` is `a[7] - (a[5] - 2 * opNum)`**

Explanation:
- Initially, `a[i + 2]` is `a[7]` which is equal to `a[6] - 2 * opNum`.
- After executing `a[i + 2] -= opNum`, `a[7]` is updated to `a[6] - 2 * opNum - opNum`, which simplifies to `a[6] - 3 * opNum`.
- The value of `opNum` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`stop`, `i`, `a[5]`, `a[6]`) also remain unchanged from their initial states.
