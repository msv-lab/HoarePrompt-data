Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `2`, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3] - opNum - 2 * opNum`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code updates `a[i + 1]` by subtracting `2 * opNum` from its current value. Given that `i` is `2`, `a[i + 1]` refers to `a[3]`. The value of `opNum` is `a[1]`, so `a[3]` is updated to `a[3] - 2 * a[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
