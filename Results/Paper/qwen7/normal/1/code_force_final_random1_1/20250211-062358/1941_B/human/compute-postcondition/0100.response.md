The code `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. This list replaces the existing list `a`. The initial values of `stop`, `i`, `opNum`, `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, `a[i + 2]`, `numTest`, and `n` remain unchanged. The output state will include these unchanged variables along with the new list `a`.

Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`, `a[i]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3]`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input.**
