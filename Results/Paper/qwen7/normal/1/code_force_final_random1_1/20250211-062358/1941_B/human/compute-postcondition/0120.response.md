Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `4`, `opNum` is `a[3]`, `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3] - 2 * opNum - opNum - opNum`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, `a[3]` is `a[3] - opNum`, `a[4]` is `a[4] - 2 * opNum`, `a[6]` is `a[6] - opNum`**

Explanation: The code updates `a[i + 2]` by subtracting `opNum`. Given that `i` is `4`, `i + 2` equals `6`. So, `a[6]` is updated by subtracting `opNum`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
