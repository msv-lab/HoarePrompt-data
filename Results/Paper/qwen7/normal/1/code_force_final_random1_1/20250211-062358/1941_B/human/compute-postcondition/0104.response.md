Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The initial state indicates that `stop` is `False`, `i` is `1`, and `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`.
- The values of `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are defined in terms of `a[n - 3]`, but these specific values are not needed to determine the output of the `print` statement.
- `numTest` is being decremented, but its exact value is not relevant to the output.
- The value of `a[i]` (which is `a[1]` since `i` is `1`) is less than 0, but this information is also not needed to determine the output of the `print` statement.
- The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output is **NO**.
