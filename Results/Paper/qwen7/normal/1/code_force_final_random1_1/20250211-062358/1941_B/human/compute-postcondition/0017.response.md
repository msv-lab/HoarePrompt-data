Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is the new input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the split input string. If the first element of `b` is an odd number and does not differ from the second element by 2, or if the last element of `b` is an odd number and does not differ from the second last element by 2, then the conditions remain as they are. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they are.
