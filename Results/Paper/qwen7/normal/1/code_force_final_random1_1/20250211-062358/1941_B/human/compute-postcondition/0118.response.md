Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `3`, `opNum` is `a[3]`, `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[1] is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3] - 2 * opNum - opNum - opNum`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, `a[3]` is `a[3] - opNum`**.

Explanation: The code `a[i] -= opNum` updates the value of `a[i]` by subtracting `opNum` from its current value. Given that `i` is `3`, the value of `a[3]` is updated to `a[3] - opNum`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
