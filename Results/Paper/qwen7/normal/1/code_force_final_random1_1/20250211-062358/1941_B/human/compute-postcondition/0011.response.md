Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition given is about the states of `t`, `a`, and `b`. However, these variables are not directly modified within the loop head. The loop itself does not change the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

3. **Determine the New State**: Since the loop head only involves `int(input())`, the only thing that changes with each iteration is the number of iterations left. The loop will run one less time than it did in the previous iteration.

Given that the loop runs `int(input())` times, if we are at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will run one less time in the next iteration. Therefore, `int(input())` will be decremented by 1.

Since no other variables are directly affected by the loop head, their states remain unchanged.

**Step-by-Step Adjustment**:
- `t` must still be greater than 0.
- `a` remains the same input integer.
- `b` remains the list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

**Final State**:
- The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, the loop will run `int(input()) - 1` times**.
