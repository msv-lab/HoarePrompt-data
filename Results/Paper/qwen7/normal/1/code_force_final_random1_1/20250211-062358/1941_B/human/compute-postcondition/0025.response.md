Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the total number of test cases (an integer greater than 0), `a` will be the last input integer received, and `b` will be the list of integers corresponding to the last input string split by spaces. For each test case, if the first element of `b` is an odd number and does not differ from the second element by 2, or if the last element of `b` is an odd number and does not differ from the second last element by 2, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.**

This means that after processing all test cases, the final values of `t`, `a`, and `b` will reflect the last test case's input, and the loop's output ('YES' or 'NO') will be determined based on the conditions specified for the last input list `b`.
