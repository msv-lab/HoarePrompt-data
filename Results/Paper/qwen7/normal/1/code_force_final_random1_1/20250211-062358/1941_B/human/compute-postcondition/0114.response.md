Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `3`, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3] - opNum - 2 * opNum - opNum`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `stop` is reassigned to `True`, which does not change its value since it was already `True`. The other variables (`i`, `opNum`, `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `numTest`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
