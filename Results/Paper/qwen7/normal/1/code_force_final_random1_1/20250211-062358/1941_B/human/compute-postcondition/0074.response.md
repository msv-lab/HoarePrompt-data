Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`, `a[i]` is `-2 * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[n - 2] - 4 * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 3]`, `numTest` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` subtracts `2 * opNum` from `a[i + 1]`. Given that `opNum` is equal to `a[n - 3]`, the operation becomes `a[i + 1] -= 2 * a[n - 3]`. Since `a[i + 1]` was originally `a[n - 2] - 2 * a[n - 3]`, after the subtraction, it becomes `a[n - 2] - 4 * a[n - 3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
