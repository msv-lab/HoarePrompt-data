Postcondition: **`stop` is `False`, `i` is `1`, `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`, `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3]`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than 0**
