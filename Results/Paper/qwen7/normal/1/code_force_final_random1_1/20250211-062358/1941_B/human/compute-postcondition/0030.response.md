Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 4, `stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `stop`. Instead, it indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the variables retain their initial states, and the `break` statement is noted as having been executed.
