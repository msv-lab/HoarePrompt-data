Output State: **`p` is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`; `ans` is a list containing all intermediate values of `p` computed during each iteration of the loop in reverse order.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `p` will hold the result of multiplying all elements in the list `b` together, with the result taken modulo `m`. The list `ans` will contain all the values of `p` that were computed during each iteration of the loop, starting from the last computed value and going backwards, effectively storing the history of `p`'s values as the loop progressed.
