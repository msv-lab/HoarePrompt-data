Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not compute the product of the array elements modulo `m` before appending the result to the list `b`. Instead, it simply appends the values of `a[l]` or `a[r]` to the list `b` without performing any modulo operation. This means that `b` will contain the original values of the array elements rather than their products modulo `m`.

To fix this, the product calculation should be performed inside the loop where the values are appended to `b`. Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    p = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the product of the remaining elements modulo m
        p = (p * a[i]) % m
        b.append(p)
        # Remove the leftmost or rightmost element based on the command
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
    return b
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected according to the problem statement.
