Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` involves appending an element from list `a` at index `r` to list `b`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about lists `a` and `b`, or the value of `r`. Therefore, none of the variables `i` or `n` are affected by this operation. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
