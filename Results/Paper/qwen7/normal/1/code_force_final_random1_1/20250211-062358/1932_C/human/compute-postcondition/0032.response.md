Output State: **`p` is the value of `p` multiplied by the last element of `b` (which is `v`) modulo `m`; `ans` contains the value of `p` appended.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. The value of `p` remains unchanged after this operation. The initial state of `p` being the value of `p` multiplied by the last element of `b` (which is `v`) modulo `m` is preserved.
