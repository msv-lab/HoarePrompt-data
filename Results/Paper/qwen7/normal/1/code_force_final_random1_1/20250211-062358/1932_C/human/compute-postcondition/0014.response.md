Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The given code snippet `b.append(a[l])` attempts to append an element from list `a` at index `l` to list `b`. However, the code snippet does not provide the definitions of `b`, `a`, and `l`, nor does it show how `i` and `n` are related to these undefined variables. Since `i` is initially 1 and `n` must be greater than 0, and there is no operation that changes the values of `i` or `n`, their states remain unchanged. The code does not affect the values of `i` and `n`, so they stay as defined in the initial state.
