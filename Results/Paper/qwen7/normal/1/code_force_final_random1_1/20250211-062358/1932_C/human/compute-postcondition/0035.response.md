Output State: **`ans` contains the value of `p` appended, `p` is updated to `p * v % m`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. The values of `p` and `ans` are updated as follows:
- `p` is updated to `p * v % m`.
- `ans` now contains the previous value of `p` appended to its existing contents.

The initial conditions are preserved except for the updates mentioned above.
