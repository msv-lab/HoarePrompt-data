To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while j < len(s) - 1:
```
This means the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than the length of the string `s` minus one.

### Given States
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `s` is an input string
- `count` is 2
- `flag` is True
- `j` is 1
- Either `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', or there is no change in the values of `s[j]` and `s[j + 1]` since the else part does not execute.

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < len(s) - 1`.
2. **Current Value of `j`**: `j` is currently 1.
3. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented and still satisfy the condition `j < len(s) - 1`.

Given that `j` is currently 1, the next value of `j` would be 2. For the loop to continue, `j` (which will be 2 in the next iteration) must still be less than `len(s) - 1`.

### Conclusion
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `j`. Specifically, `j` must be such that `j < len(s) - 1` in the next iteration. Since `j` is currently 1, it will become 2 in the next iteration, so we need to ensure that `2 < len(s) - 1`.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` must be less than the length of `s` minus one**.

However, since `j` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `2 < len(s) - 1`, which simplifies to `len(s) > 3`.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` must be less than the length of `s` minus one (or equivalently, `len(s) > 3`)**.
