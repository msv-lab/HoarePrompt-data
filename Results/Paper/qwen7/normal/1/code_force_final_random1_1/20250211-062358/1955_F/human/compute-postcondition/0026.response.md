Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first three elements are equal and odd, and the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `x` is the first element of `a`, `cnt` is increased by the floor division of `x` by 2, `cnt` is equal to `math.floor(x / 2)`**.

In natural language: `a` remains a list of integers with the first three elements being equal and odd, and the first element being a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\). `x` is the first element of `a`. The variable `cnt` is increased by the floor division of `x` by 2, making `cnt` equal to `math.floor(x / 2)`.
