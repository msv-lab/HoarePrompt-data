Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a set of four non-negative integers p_i (representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence) where each p_i is between 0 and 200, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Based on these inputs, the function returns specific values or performs certain operations without modifying the input parameters directly.**
