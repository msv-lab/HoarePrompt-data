Output State: `a` is a list where all elements are equal and odd, the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `cnt` is the sum of the floor divisions of each element in `a` by 2, after the loop has completed all its iterations.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `cnt` will be the total sum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor\) for each element \(x\) in the list `a`. This is because the loop processes each element of `a` exactly once, adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor\) to `cnt` for every element. Given that all elements in `a` are equal and odd, each element contributes either 0 or 1 to `cnt` when divided by 2 and floored. Therefore, the final value of `cnt` will be the sum of these contributions from all elements in `a`.
