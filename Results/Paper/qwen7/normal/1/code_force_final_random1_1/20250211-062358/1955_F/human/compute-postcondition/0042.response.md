Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list that must contain at least 3 elements.
   - The first three elements of `a` are equal and odd.
   - The first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `cnt` is increased by the floor division of the next element `x` by 2.
   - `cnt` is now equal to the original `cnt` plus the floor division of `x` by 2.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.
   - The only variable in the loop head is `x`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over the list `a`, the next value of `x` will be the next element in the list.
   - The list `a` must still contain at least 3 elements.
   - The first three elements of `a` must still be equal and odd.
   - The first element of `a` must still be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `cnt` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a` must still contain at least 3 elements.
- The first three elements of `a` must still be equal and odd.
- The first element of `a` must still be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `cnt` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.

Since the loop is about to execute another iteration, the next element `x` will be the fourth element of the list `a` (if it exists).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`a` is a list that must contain at least 4 elements, the first four elements of `a` are equal and odd, the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `cnt` is increased by the floor division of the fourth element of `a` by 2**.
