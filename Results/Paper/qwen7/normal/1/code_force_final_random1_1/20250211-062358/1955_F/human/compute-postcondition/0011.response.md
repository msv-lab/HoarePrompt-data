Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively. It returns the total count of these numbers.**

This means the function takes four integers as inputs indirectly through a list or tuple, calculates the sum of these integers, and returns the total count.
