Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is explicitly given as 2.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be greater than 2, but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement.
- `k` is explicitly given as 1.
- `res` is an input string, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Substituting the known values:
- `'?'` remains as `'?'`.
- `k` is 1.
- `best` is 2.
- `k` again is 1.
- `i` is 3.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 1 2 1 3'**
