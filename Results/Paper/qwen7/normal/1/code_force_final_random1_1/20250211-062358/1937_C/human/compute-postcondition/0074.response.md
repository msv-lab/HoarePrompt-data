Output State: **`best` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `res`. The values of `best`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 is still valid.
