Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `res` is an input string (this variable is not directly involved in the loop condition).
   - If the current value of `res` is '<', then `k` is set to 2 (this condition does not affect the loop execution).

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 3 (since `i` is now 3).

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `total` is not mentioned, so it remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `res` and `k` are not directly affected by the loop condition and remain as they were.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
