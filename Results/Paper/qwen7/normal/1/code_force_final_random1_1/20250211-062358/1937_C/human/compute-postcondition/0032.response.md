Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is explicitly given as 1.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is stated to be greater than 1 but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement.
- `k` is explicitly given as 1.
- `res` is an input string with its current value being '<'.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` is 1.
- `best` is 1.
- `k` is 1 again.
- `i` is 2.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output these values in sequence.

Output: **'? 1 1 1 2'**
