To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the variables involved.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

From this, we can identify the following:
- `_` is a placeholder used as the loop variable, which is typically ignored in the loop body since it is not used.
- `int(input())` is the condition that determines how many times the loop will run. This means the loop will run as many times as the integer value entered by the user when prompted.

### Variables Involved
- The loop variable `_` is not used inside the loop, so no state adjustment is needed for it.
- The number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`, which means the state of the input buffer must be adjusted to provide a valid integer value.

### Required Adjustments
Since the loop runs based on the integer value entered by the user, the state of the input buffer must be set to a valid integer value. This integer value will determine the number of iterations the loop will perform.

### Conclusion
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input buffer to provide a valid integer value.
