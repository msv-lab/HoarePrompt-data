The function interacts with an external entity to determine a permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) through a series of up to 3n queries. It finds indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. After completing the queries, it outputs the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that achieve this maximum XOR value.
