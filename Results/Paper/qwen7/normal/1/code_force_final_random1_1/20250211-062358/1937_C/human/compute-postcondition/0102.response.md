Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `n` (exclusive), meaning `i` starts at 2 and increments until it is no longer less than `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is the input provided by the user.
   - If `res` is equal to '<', then `k` is set to `i`.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 2`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is defined by the variable `i`, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1` for the next iteration.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

6. **Consider the postcondition**: The postcondition mentions `k` being set to `i` if `res` is '<'. However, this does not affect the loop itself; it only affects the state outside the loop.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` is the input provided by the user, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**.
