Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is stated to be greater than 3 but no specific value is provided for `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a string literal.
- `0` is an integer literal.
- `k` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information. We will leave it as `k`.
- `0` is another integer literal.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by `0`, then `k`, then `0`, and finally `3`.

Output: **'? 0 k 0 3'**
