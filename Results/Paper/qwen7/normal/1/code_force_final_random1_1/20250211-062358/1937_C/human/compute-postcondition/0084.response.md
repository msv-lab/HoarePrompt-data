Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is `i`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `k` is `n-1`
- `res` is an input string, and it does not equal '<' (since no change occurs).

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values being printed:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` is `n-1`.
- `best` is `i`, and since `i` is `n-1`, `best` is also `n-1`.
- `k` is `n-1`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

So, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? n-1 n-1 n-1 n-1'**
