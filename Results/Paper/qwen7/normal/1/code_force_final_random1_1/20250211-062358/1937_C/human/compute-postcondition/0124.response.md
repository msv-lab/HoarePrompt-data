Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is explicitly given as 1.
- `res` is explicitly given as '<'.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `k` is defined as `n-1`, where `n` is an input integer provided by the user.
- `n` is the input integer provided by the user.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` is `n-1`.
- `best` is 1.
- `k` again is `n-1`.
- `i` is 2.

So, the print statement will output a string with these components.

Output: **'? [n-1] 1 [n-1] 2' (where n is the input integer provided by the user)**
