You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

The solution for the first test case can look as follows:

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        
        print(z)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to `a-1`, `x` and `y` will be the last input integers provided during the loop's execution, `z` will be the final calculated value based on the last iteration's `y` and `x`, and `m` will be the result of `15 * z - y * 4`. If the condition `m < a` was met during the last iteration, `z` will be adjusted accordingly.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Specifically, the logic for calculating `z` and `m` does not accurately reflect the constraints of the problem. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `10 10`
- Expected Output: `3` (since 10 * 2 × 2 icons take up 10 * 4 = 40 cells, and 15 - 4 = 11 cells can fit 1 * 1 icons, so we need 3 screens: 2 for 2 × 2 icons and 1 for 1 × 1 icons).

However, the program's logic does not account for the remaining space after placing the 2 × 2 icons, leading to incorrect results. For instance, the program might incorrectly calculate the number of 1 × 1 icons that can fit into the remaining space, which can lead to an underestimation or overestimation of the total number of screens needed.
