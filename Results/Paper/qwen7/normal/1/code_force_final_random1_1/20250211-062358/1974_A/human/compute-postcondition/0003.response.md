Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The variable `z` is assigned the value of `(y + 1) // 2`. Since `y` is an input integer, `z` will be the result of adding 1 to `y` and then performing integer division by 2. The values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged.
