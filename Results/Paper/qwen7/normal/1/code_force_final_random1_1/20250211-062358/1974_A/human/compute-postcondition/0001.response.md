Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head:
   - The loop head is `for i in range(a):`
   - The variables involved are `i` and `a`.

2. Determine the initial state of these variables:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but this variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution directly.
   - `a` is an input integer.

3. Understand the condition for the loop to execute:
   - The loop will execute as long as `a` is a positive integer (since `range(a)` will generate numbers from 0 to `a-1`).

4. Adjust the states accordingly:
   - Since the loop depends on `a`, `a` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 in the first iteration, so no specific value is needed for `i` at the start.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `a` must be a positive integer.

State: **`a` must be a positive integer**
