Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The variable `i` was initially set to 1 and is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` remains 1, while `x` and `y` are assigned the integer values from the input.
