Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` and `y` are input integers.
   - `z` is initially set to \((y + 1) // 2\).
   - `m` is set to \(15 \times z - y \times 4\).

2. **Condition Check:**
   - If `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15\).

Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the possible scenarios:

- Since `i` is 2, it does not directly affect the calculation of `z` or `m`.
- `z` is initially \((y + 1) // 2\), which means `z` is the integer division of `(y + 1)` by 2.
- `m` is calculated as \(15 \times z - y \times 4\).

The key point is the condition check `if m < a:`. Without knowing the value of `a`, we cannot definitively determine if this condition is true or false. However, since the problem asks us to determine what will be printed, and the only output is `z`, we need to consider the initial value of `z`.

Since the condition `if m < a:` might or might not change `z`, the final value of `z` will be the initial value unless the condition is met. Given no specific value for `a` is provided, we assume the initial value of `z` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the value of `z` that will be printed is \((y + 1) // 2\).

Output: **(y + 1) // 2**
