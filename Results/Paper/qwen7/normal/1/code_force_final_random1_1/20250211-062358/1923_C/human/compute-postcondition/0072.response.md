Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the first element of `l`, `i` is `x` + the original value of `i`, `j` remains unchanged if `x` is not 1, otherwise `j` is increased by 1, and `p` is a list containing `i`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. The value of `i` is updated to `x +` the original value of `i`, where `x` is the first element of the list `l`. The value of `j` remains unchanged unless `x` is 1, in which case `j` is increased by 1. All other variables retain their original states.
