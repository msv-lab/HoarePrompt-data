Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user**.

Explanation: The code splits the input (which must be two positive integers separated by a space) into two parts and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
