Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be the last element in the list `l`, `i` will be the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` will be the count of 1s in `l`, `p` will be a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l` up to each element, and `c` will be a list containing the count of 1s encountered so far for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition is false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` is `m - 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the condition holds as is. Otherwise, the condition also holds as is.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` is `m - 2`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
