Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the third element of `l`, `i` is the third element of `l` + the original value of `i`, `j` is increased by 1 if the third element of `l` is 1, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`, `c` is a list containing `j + 1` if the third element of `l` is 1, otherwise it contains `j`, `i` is updated to `i + x**.

Explanation: The code `i += x` updates the value of `i` by adding the value of `x` (which is the third element of `l`) to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
