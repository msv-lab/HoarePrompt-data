Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the second element of `l`, `i` is the second element of `l` + the original value of `i`, `j` is increased by 1, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`, `c` is a list containing `j`**.

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `l` remains a non-empty list of integers, `x` remains the second element of `l`, `i` remains the second element of `l` plus the original value of `i`, and `j` is increased by 1. The lists `p` and `c` contain the updated values of `i` and `j`, respectively.
