Output State: **`x` is equal to the first element of `l` and is currently 1, `i` is increased by 1 and is now 2, `j` is increased by 1 and is now 2, `p` is a list containing the value 2.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. Initially, `i` was increased by `x` (which is 1) making `i` equal to 2. After appending, `p` contains the value 2. The values of `x` and `j` remain unchanged.
