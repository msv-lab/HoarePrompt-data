Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- The condition `s - (b - a + 1) < i` holds true.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
