Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the first element of `l`, `i` is `x` + the original value of `i`, and `j` remains unchanged if `x` is not 1, otherwise `j` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `i` is updated to be the sum of its original value and the first element of the list `l` (which is stored in `x`). The value of `j` is only increased by 1 if `x` is equal to 1; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.
