Output State: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(), `m` is 0, `a` is the same as the last value of `a` from the previous iteration, `b` is the same as the last value of `b` from the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `s` is the same as the last value of `s` from the previous iteration, `p` is a list containing 0, `c` is a list containing 0.**

This output state reflects that the variables `i` and `j` have been initialized to 0, while the other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
