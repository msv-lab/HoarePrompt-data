You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` will be 0 because `m` is decremented in each iteration of the inner loop until it reaches 0. The variables `a` and `b` will contain the values from the last input pair of integers provided during the loop's execution. The variable `i` will be `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, which represents the count of 1s between indices `a-1` and `b` inclusive. The variable `s` will be `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, representing the sum of elements between indices `a-1` and `b` inclusive. The condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i` will be evaluated for the last input pair, and either 'YES' or 'NO' will be printed based on the result. The lists `p` and `c` will be fully constructed based on the input sequence `l`, with `p` containing cumulative sums and `c` containing cumulative counts of 1s. Variables `j` and the input list `l` will remain unchanged from their initial states as they are not affected by the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the length of the array `c` and the number of queries.
   - It then reads the array `c` of length `n`.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program initializes two lists `p` and `c`. 
     - `p` is used to store prefix sums of the array `c`.
     - `c` is used to store the count of `1`s up to each position in the array `c`.
   - It iterates through the array `c` to fill these lists:
     - `p[i]` stores the sum of the first `i` elements of `c`.
     - `c[i]` stores the count of `1`s in the first `i` elements of `c`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `a` and `b` which define the subarray.
   - It calculates:
     - `i`: the count of `1`s in the subarray `c[a-1]` to `c[b]`.
     - `s`: the sum of the subarray `c[a-1]` to `c[b]`.
   - It checks if the subarray is good:
     - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures the subarray has more than one element.
     - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the count of `1`s in the subarray.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Prefix Sums and Count of `1`s:**
   - The prefix sums (`p`) and count of `1`s (`c`) are correctly computed.
   - These values help in efficiently calculating the sum and count of `1`s in any subarray.

2. **Subarray Goodness Check:**
   - The check `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is crucial. This condition ensures that the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` where:
     - The sum of the subarray remains the same.
     - Each element in the subarray is different from the corresponding element in the original subarray.
     - Each element in the new subarray is positive.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the subarray has only one element (`b - a + 1 <= 1`). In such cases, the subarray cannot be good because it cannot satisfy the condition `a_i ≠ b_i` for all `i`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The preprocessing step ensures efficient computation, and the query processing step accurately checks the subarray goodness.
