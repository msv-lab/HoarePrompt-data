Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`
- The difference between `s` and the length of the segment `(b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`
- The length of the segment `(b - a + 1)` is greater than 1

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
