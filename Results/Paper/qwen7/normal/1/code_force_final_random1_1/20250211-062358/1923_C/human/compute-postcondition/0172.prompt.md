Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `l` has been fully iterated over. The variable `i` holds the sum of all elements in `l`. The variable `j` is the count of how many times an element in `l` equals 1. The list `p` contains the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to each index. The list `c` contains the cumulative count of 1s encountered up to each index.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If the difference between `s` and the length of the segment `(b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i` and the length of the segment `(b - a + 1)` is greater than 1, then the conditions remain as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the conditions match those specified in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `a` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer, `s` is updated to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions also remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `a` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer, `s` is updated to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions also remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
