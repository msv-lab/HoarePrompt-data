Output State: **`m` is `m - 2`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = p[b] - p[a - 1]` does not change any variables. It simply reassigns the value of `s` to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, which was already defined in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
