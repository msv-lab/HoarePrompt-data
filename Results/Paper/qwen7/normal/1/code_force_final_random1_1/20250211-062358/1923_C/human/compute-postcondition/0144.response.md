Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 4, `p` is [2, 2 + (next element in `l`)], `c` is [2, 3], if `x` equals 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += x` increments the value of `i` by the value of `x`. Given that `x` is equal to 1, `i` which was initially 2 + (next element in `l`) becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
