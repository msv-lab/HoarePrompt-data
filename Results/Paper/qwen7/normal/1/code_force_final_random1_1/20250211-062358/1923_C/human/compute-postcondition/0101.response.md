Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `m`, `c`, `p`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the conditions and values of `m`, `c`, `p`, `i`, and `s` remain the same as they were before the code was executed.
