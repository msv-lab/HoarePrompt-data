Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the first element of `l`, `i` is `x` + the original value of `i`, `j` remains unchanged if `x` is not 1, otherwise `j` is increased by 1, and `p` is a list containing `i`, `c` is a list containing `j`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. The values of `l`, `x`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `j` changes only if `x` is 1, in which case it is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged. Therefore, `c` now contains the updated value of `j`.
