Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the third element of `l`, `i` is the third element of `l` + the original value of `i`, `j` is increased by 1 if the third element of `l` is 1, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`, `c` is a list containing `j + 1` if the third element of `l` is 1, otherwise it contains `j`, `i` is updated to `i + x, p.append(i), c.append(j)**

Explanation: 
- `x` remains the third element of `l`.
- `i` is updated to `i + x`.
- `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`.
- `c` is a list containing `j + 1` if the third element of `l` is 1, otherwise it contains `j`.
- `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`.

Since the code only appends the current value of `j` to `c`, the output state includes the updated values of `i`, `p`, and `c`.
