Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the second element of `l`, `i` is the second element of `l` + the original value of `i`, `j` is increased by 1 if the second element of `l` is 1, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`, `c` is a list containing `j + 1` if the second element of `l` is 1, otherwise it contains `j`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. Whether `j` is increased by 1 depends on whether the second element of `l` is 1. If it is 1, `j` is increased by 1 before being appended to `c`. If it is not 1, `j` remains unchanged and is appended to `c`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
