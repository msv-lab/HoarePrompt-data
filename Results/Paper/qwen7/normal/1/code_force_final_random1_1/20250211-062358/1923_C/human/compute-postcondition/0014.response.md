Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in l`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `l`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `x`: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was set to 1. Since `x` is taken from the list `l`, it means `x` will be the next element in the list `l`.
   - `l`: The list `l` is a non-empty list of integers. For the loop to execute again, `l` must still be a non-empty list.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - `x` will be the next element in the list `l`. Since `x` was 1 in the previous iteration, the next element in `l` will be the new value of `x`.
   - `l` must remain a non-empty list for the loop to continue executing.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`x` is the next element in the list `l`, `l` is a non-empty list of integers**
