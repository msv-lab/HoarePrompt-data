Output State: **`i` is increased by `x`, `x` is the next element in the list `l`, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, and if `x` equals 1, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged; `p` is a list containing the value of `i` after it was increased by `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `i` (after it was increased by `x`) to the list `p`. The values of `i`, `x`, `l`, and `j` remain as per the initial conditions unless `x` equals 1, in which case `j` would be increased by 1. The new information is that `p` now contains the updated value of `i`.
