Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t`, followed by an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `m` queries. Each query involves two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, the function calculates the sum of elements and the count of 1s within the specified range `[l_i, r_i]` in the list `c`. It then checks if the difference between the sum and the length of the range is greater than or equal to the count of 1s. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries for a test case, the function moves to the next test case.**
