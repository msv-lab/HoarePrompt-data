Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `m` is `1` - 1 which is `0`; `a` is the same as the last value of `a` from the previous iteration; `b` is the same as the last value of `b` from the previous iteration; `i` is the same as the last value of `i` from the previous iteration; `s` is the same as the last value of `s` from the previous iteration.**

This output state reflects that `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input, `m` is decremented by 1 making it 0, while `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` retain their values from the previous iteration.
