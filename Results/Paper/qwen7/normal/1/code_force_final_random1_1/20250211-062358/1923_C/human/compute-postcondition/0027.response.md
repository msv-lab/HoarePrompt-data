Output State: **`i` is increased by the next element in `l` and equals the previous value of `i` plus the next element in `l`; `x` is the next element in `l`; `j` remains unchanged; `l` is a non-empty list of integers; `p` is a list containing the value of `i` after it was increased by the next `x`; `c` is a list containing the value of `j`; `c` is appended with the current value of `j`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. The values of `i`, `x`, `l`, `p`, and `j` remain unchanged from their previous states.
