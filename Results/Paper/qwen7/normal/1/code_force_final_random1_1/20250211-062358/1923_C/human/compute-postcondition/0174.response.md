Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` will be 0, indicating that all queries have been processed. The variables `a` and `b` will contain the values from the last query input by the user. The variable `i` will be `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, representing the count of 1s between indices `a-1` and `b` inclusive. The variable `s` will be `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, representing the sum of elements between indices `a-1` and `b` inclusive. The lists `p` and `c` will be updated to include the cumulative sums and counts of 1s up to the last index `b`. The variable `j` will remain unchanged from its initial state, as it is not affected by the loop.
