Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- `s` is initially `p[b] - p[a - 1]`
- `a` and `b` are then updated to new input integers
- `s` is updated to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
