Postcondition: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. The difference between `s` and the length of the segment `(b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, and the length of the segment `(b - a + 1)` is greater than 1.**
