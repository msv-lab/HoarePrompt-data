Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is `m + 1`, `a` and `b` are updated based on the new input, `i` and `s` are recalculated using the updated `a` and `b`, `p` and `c` are updated to reflect the new cumulative values.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. It does not affect the values of `a` and `b`, but since they are updated based on the new input, their values are now dependent on the new inputs. Similarly, `i` and `s` are recalculated using the updated `a` and `b`, and `p` and `c` are updated to reflect the new cumulative values based on the new `a` and `b`.
