Output State: **`nx` is a string that has been updated to include 'S', `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `1`, and `i` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. The values of `j`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
