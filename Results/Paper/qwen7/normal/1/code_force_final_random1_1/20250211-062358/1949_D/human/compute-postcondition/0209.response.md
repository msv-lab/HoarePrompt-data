Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nx` is a string.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - The value of `nx` is determined based on the conditions inside the loop.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - For each `j` from 1 to `n + 1`, the loop body sets `nx` based on the conditions given.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The variable `j` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `i`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `nx` remains unchanged as it is set within the loop body and not modified outside the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` is set to `n + 1` at the start of the loop, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `nx` is a string (unchanged).
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged).
- `i` will be `n + 1` (as it was set to `n + 1` at the start of the current iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`nx` is a string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `n + 1`**.
