Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `nx` is an empty string (this variable is not used in the loop head).
   - `i` is `n + 1`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1` (inclusive).

4. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - The variable `j` will start at 1 and increment until it reaches `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `nx` is not used in the loop head, its state does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `i` is `n + 1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head.
   - The variable `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**State: **`nx` is an empty string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n + 1`**.
