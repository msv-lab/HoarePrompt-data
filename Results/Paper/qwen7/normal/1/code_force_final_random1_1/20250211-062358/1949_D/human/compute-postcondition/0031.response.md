Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `b[i]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is 1, `b[1]` is increased by 1. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition related to `x[1]` (whether it equals 'F' or 'S') does not affect the current operation since it only modifies `b[i]`.
