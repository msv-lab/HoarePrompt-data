Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `x` is a list, `b[i]` is incremented by 1.**

The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. The initial state of `j` is `n + 1`, `x` is a list, and no changes are needed for `a[j]` or `b[j]` since the loop has completed. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged except for `b[i]` which is incremented by 1.
