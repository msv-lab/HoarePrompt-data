Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - From the given state before the loop starts, `j` is `n + 1`.
   - The state of `nx` (which is not used in the loop) is irrelevant for this adjustment.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `j` is within the range specified by `range(1, n + 1)`. This means `j` should be between 1 and `n + 1` (inclusive).

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since `j` is currently `n + 1`, it is not within the range `1` to `n + 1` (assuming `n` is a non-negative integer). Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to be within this range for the loop to execute.

Given that `j` should be within the range `1` to `n + 1`, and considering the initial value of `j` as `n + 1`, we need to adjust `j` to be `1` (the smallest possible value in the range).

5. **Final state after adjustment**: The state of `nx` remains unchanged, and `j` is adjusted to `1`.

So, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`nx` is an empty string, `j` is 1, `n` must be a non-negative integer**
