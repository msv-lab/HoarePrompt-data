Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` remains the same, `xx[i][0]` is `'?'`, and `nx` is `'FF'`.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` was previously determined based on the conditions involving `i` and `3` being in the first quarter of `sa`. After executing `nx += 'F'`, `nx` appends the character 'F' to its current value. Since the initial value of `nx` was either `'F'` or `'FS'` depending on the condition, appending 'F' to both results in `nx` becoming `'FF'`. The other variables (`j`, `n`, and `xx[i][0]`) remain unchanged.
