Output State: **`nx` is now the string `xx[i][j - 1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**.

Explanation: The code appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is updated to include this character. The values of `n`, `i`, and the condition about `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged.
