Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is at least 2; `j` is 2; `a[1]` is increased by 1.**

The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `a` by 1. Given that `i` is 1, the value at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n` and `j`) are not affected by this operation.
