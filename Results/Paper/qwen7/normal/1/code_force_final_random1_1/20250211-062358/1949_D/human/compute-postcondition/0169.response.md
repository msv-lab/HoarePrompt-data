Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `n` must be between 2 and 24, `xx[i][j - 1] == '?'`, and neither `i` is in `sa[:n // 4]` nor `j` is in `sa[:n // 4]`.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is concatenated with the string `'S'`, making `nx` equal to `'S'`. The conditions on `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the indices `i` and `j` relative to the list `sa` remain unchanged.
