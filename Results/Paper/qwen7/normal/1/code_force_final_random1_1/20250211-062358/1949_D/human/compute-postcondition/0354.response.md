Postcondition: `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `j` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the character at position `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is equal to '?'. If either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'. If the condition `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'` is true, then `nx` is the string formed by appending `xx[i][j - 1]` to the end of the empty string, `j` is 2, and `n` remains a non-negative integer.
