### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to fill in the undecided transition videos (`?`) such that no matter the order of scenarios, no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type are shown.
   - The input provides an initial plan where some transitions are already decided (`F` for funny, `S` for scary), and others are undecided (`?`).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the input and counts the number of `F` and `S` for each scenario.
   - It then categorizes scenarios into two lists (`sa` and `sb`) based on the count of `F` and `S`.
   - Depending on the size of these lists, it decides whether to prioritize `F` or `S` for the undecided transitions.
   - For each scenario, it constructs the final output string by checking if the current or target scenario is in the prioritized list. If so, it adds `F` or `S`; otherwise, it adds the opposite type.

3. **Issues Identified:**
   - The logic for determining the prioritized list (`sa` or `sb`) is flawed. The condition `if len(sa) >= len(sb):` does not necessarily ensure that the solution will meet the requirement.
   - The code does not consider the global constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type.
   - The logic for filling in the undecided transitions is overly simplistic and may not guarantee the required constraint.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the first example with \( n = 5 \).
   - The initial plan is:
     ```
     .?F??
     ?.???
     F?.S?
     ??S.?
     ????.
     ```
   - The code would categorize and fill in the undecided transitions, but it does not ensure the constraint is met for all permutations.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type are shown for any permutation of scenarios. The logic for deciding the type of undecided transitions is insufficient and may lead to invalid outputs.

**Correctness: False**
