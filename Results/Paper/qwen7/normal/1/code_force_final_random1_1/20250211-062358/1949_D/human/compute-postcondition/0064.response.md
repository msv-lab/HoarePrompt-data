Output State: **`x` is an array, `a[j]` is an integer + 2, `b[j_end + 1]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j_end + 2`, and `n` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `a[i]` was initially an integer + 1, after the operation, `a[j]` will be an integer + 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
