Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `a[i]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is 1, `a[1]` is increased by 1. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition related to `x[1]` and `a[2]` or `b[1]` does not affect the current state since `i` is 1.
