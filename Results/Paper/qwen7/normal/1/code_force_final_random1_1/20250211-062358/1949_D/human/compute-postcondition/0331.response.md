Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'.
   - `j` is `j + 1`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is either 'Sxx[i][j - 1]' or 'Fxx[i][j - 1]'.
   - Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `nx` becomes either 'SF' or 'FF'.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - We need to check the condition for `j + 1` to determine the new value of `nx`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - We need to check the condition for `j + 1` to determine the new value of `nx`.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, let's denote the current value of `j` as `j_current`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j_current + 1`.

Since the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`, and assuming `j` is currently at `j_current`, the next value of `j` will be `j_current + 1`.

The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change in `j` and the potential change in `nx` based on the conditions provided.

**State:**
- `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'.
- `j` is `j_current + 1`.
- If `xx[i][j_current]` is not '?', then `nx` is either 'Sxx[i][j_current]' or 'Fxx[i][j_current]'.
- Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j_current + 1` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `nx` becomes either 'SF' or 'FF'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `j` is `j + 1`, if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is either 'Sxx[i][j - 1]' or 'Fxx[i][j - 1]', otherwise if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` remains unchanged, otherwise `nx` becomes either 'SF' or 'FF'**.
