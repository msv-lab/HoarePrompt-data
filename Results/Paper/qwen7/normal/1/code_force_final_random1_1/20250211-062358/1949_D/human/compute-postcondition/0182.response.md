Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Determine the New State of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j = 1` and increments `j` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Check the New Value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was within the range `[1, n]`. After incrementing `j` by 1, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

5. **Check the New Value of `nx`**: The value of `nx` depends on the conditions involving `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, and `j` relative to `sa`. However, since `j` is incremented by 1, the condition `xx[i][j - 1]` will now refer to `xx[i][j]`.

6. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the state reflects the new value of `j` and the potential change in `nx`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `j` and the possible unchanged or updated value of `nx`.

**New State**:
- `nx` is either 'FF' or 'FS' or 'SF' or 'SS'
- `n` must be between 2 and 24 (unchanged)
- `xx[i][j]` is either 'F' or 'S' (since `j` is incremented by 1, this changes from `xx[i][j - 1]` to `xx[i][j]`)
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if either `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is either 'FF' or 'SF'. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'FS' or 'SS'.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`nx` is either 'FF' or 'FS' or 'SF' or 'SS', `n` must be between 2 and 24, and `xx[i][j]` is either 'F' or 'S'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if either `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is either 'FF' or 'SF'. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'FS' or 'SS'.**
