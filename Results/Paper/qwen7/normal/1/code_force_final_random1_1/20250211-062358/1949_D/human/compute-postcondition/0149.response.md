Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `j` is not equal to 1, `sa` is a list containing all integers from 6 to n with 1 appended and 3, `sb` is a list containing all integers from 6 to n, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, then no change occurs.
