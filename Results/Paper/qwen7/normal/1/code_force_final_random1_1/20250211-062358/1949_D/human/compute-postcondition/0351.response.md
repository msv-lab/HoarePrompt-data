Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `j` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the character at position `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` is not equal to '?', and `i` is not in the first quarter of `sb` and `j` is not in the first quarter of `sb`.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` was initially an empty string. After executing `nx += 'F'`, `nx` now contains the string 'F'. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `xx[i]`, `i`, and `sb`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
