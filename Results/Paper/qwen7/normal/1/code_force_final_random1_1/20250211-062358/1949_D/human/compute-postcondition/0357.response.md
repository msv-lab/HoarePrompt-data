Output State: **`nx` is either 'SS' or 'SF' or 'FS' or 'FF', `j` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 1) in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `j-1` (which is 1) in the list `xx[i]` to the string `nx`. Since `j` is 2, the character at index 1 is appended to `nx`. The initial value of `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'. After appending the character, `nx` can become 'SS', 'SF', 'FS', or 'FF'. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition about the character at position `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` not being '?' remains valid.
