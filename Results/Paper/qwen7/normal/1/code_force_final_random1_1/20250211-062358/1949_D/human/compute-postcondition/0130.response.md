Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 6
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 24
   - `j` is not equal to `n + 1`
   - `sa` is a list containing the integer 6
   - `sb` is a list containing the integer 6
   - If `b[6] > 0` and `a[6] == 0`, no changes are made.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `7`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 7.
   - The other variables (`j`, `sa`, `sb`) are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` becomes 7
   - `n` must be an integer between 7 and 24 (since it must be greater than or equal to 7 and still within the original range)
   - `j` is not equal to `n + 1`
   - `sa` remains a list containing the integer 6
   - `sb` remains a list containing the integer 6
   - The postcondition about `b[6]` and `a[6]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 7, `n` is an integer between 7 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`, `sa` is a list containing the integer 6, `sb` is a list containing the integer 6**
