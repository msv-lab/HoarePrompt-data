Postcondition: **`nx` is either 'S' concatenated with the original value of `nx` if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or 'F' concatenated with the original value of `nx` if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`. Additionally, `j` is within the range 3 to \( n \), and \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, stating that the value of `nx` depends on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`. If either is in the first quarter, `nx` becomes 'S' concatenated with its original value. Otherwise, `nx` becomes 'F' concatenated with its original value. The values of `j` and `n` remain within their specified ranges.
