Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be at least 2; `j` is 1; `a[j]` is increased by 1; the current value of `x[j - 1]` is 'F'.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, this means `a[1]` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously mentioned states.
