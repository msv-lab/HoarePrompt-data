Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` remains the same, `xx[i][0]` is `'?'`, `nx` is `'FS'`**.

Explanation: Initially, `j` is 3, `n` remains unchanged, `xx[i][0]` is `'?'`, and `nx` is determined based on whether `i` or 3 is in the first quarter of `sa`. After executing `nx += xx[i][j - 1]`, since `j - 1` equals 2, `xx[i][2]` is `'?'`. Therefore, `nx` becomes `'FS'`. The other variables remain unchanged.
