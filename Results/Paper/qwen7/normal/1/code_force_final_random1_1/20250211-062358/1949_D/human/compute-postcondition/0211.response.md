Output State: **`nx` is "F" + the original string of `nx`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` was initially a string, appending 'F' to it results in a new string that includes the original string of `nx` followed by 'F'. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
