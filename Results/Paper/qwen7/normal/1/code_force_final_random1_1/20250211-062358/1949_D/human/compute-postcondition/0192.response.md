Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1 - 1`, meaning it iterates over the range `[1, n]`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `nx` is a string of length `n`, composed of characters 'F' and 'S'.
   - `i` is the current index being processed in the loop.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `nx` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `i` needs to be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.

Given that `i` was the last index processed, the next index `i` should be `i + 1`. For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be within the range `[1, n]`.

Since no specific value for `i` was given in the example, let's assume `i` was the maximum value it could be in the previous iteration (which would be `n`), then for the next iteration, `i` would be `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`nx` is a string of length `n`, composed of characters 'F' and 'S', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n + 1`**.

However, since `n` itself does not change within the loop, the condition `n` must be greater than or equal to `n + 1` is always false. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the loop will terminate if `i` reaches `n + 1`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`nx` is a string of length `n`, composed of characters 'F' and 'S', `i` is `n + 1`**.
