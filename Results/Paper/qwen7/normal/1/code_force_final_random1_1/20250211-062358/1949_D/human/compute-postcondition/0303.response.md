Output State: **`nx` is 'S' concatenated with the original value of `nx`; `j` is within the range 3 to \( n \), \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24; the conditions for `nx` remain the same.**

Explanation:
- The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`.
- Since `nx` was previously determined to be either incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', 'S' concatenated with the original value of `nx` if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or 'F' concatenated with the original value of `nx` if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, appending 'S' to `nx` means that `nx` is now 'S' concatenated with the original value of `nx`.
- The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
