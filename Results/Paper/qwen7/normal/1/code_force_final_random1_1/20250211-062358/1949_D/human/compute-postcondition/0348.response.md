Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `j` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, and either the character at position `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` is equal to '?' and `i` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the existing string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'S'. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition involving `i` and the lists `xx` and `sb` also remains the same.
