Output State: **`nx` is either 'SF' or 'FF', `j` is `j + 1`**

Explanation: The initial state is that `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', and `j` is incremented by 1. The code `nx += 'F'` appends 'F' to the current value of `nx`. Since `nx` could initially be 'S' or 'F', after appending 'F', `nx` will be either 'SF' or 'FF'. The value of `j` remains as `j + 1` because no further operations are performed on `j`.
