Output State: **`j` must be within the range [1, n], `x` is a list where the element at index `j - 1` is 'S', `b[j]` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `b[j]` has been increased by 1, while the conditions and values of `j`, `x`, and `b[i]` remain as they were in the initial state. The element at index `j - 1` in the list `x` is still 'S', and `b[i]` is incremented by 1 but not `b[j]`.
