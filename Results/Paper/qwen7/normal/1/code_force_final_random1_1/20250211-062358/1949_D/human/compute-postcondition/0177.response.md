Output State: **`nx` is either 'FS' or 'SS', `n` must be between 2 and 24, and `xx[i][j]` is either 'F' or 'S'.**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is concatenated with 'S'. Since `nx` could initially be either 'F' or 'S', after the operation, `nx` will be either 'FS' or 'SS'. The values of `n` and `xx[i][j]` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
