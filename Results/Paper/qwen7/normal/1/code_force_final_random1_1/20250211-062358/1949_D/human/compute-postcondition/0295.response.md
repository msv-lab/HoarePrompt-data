Output State: **`j` is within the range 2 to \( n \), \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24, and `nx` is 'F' concatenated with the original value of `nx`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the current value of `nx`. Since the initial condition does not specify the exact value of `nx` before this operation, we only know that it gets appended with 'F'. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged as no operations affecting them are performed.
