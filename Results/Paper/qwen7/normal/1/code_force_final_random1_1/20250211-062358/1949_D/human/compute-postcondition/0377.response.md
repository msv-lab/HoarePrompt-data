Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes an input consisting of n lines, each containing n characters representing a partial transition video plan. Each character can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no transition video specified). The function ensures that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided, and all other characters are undecided (?). Based on this input, the function determines the state of the transition video plan.**

This means the function takes no explicit parameters but operates on an input that is described by the constraints given, analyzing the partially filled transition video plan to check the state of decision-making for each slot.
