Output State: **`nx` is either 'FF' or 'FS' or 'SF' or 'SS', `n` must be between 2 and 24, and `xx[i][j]` is either 'F' or 'S'.**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by concatenating it with the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Since `nx` can initially be either 'F' or 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` can also be either 'F' or 'S', the possible new values for `nx` are 'FF', 'FS', 'SF', or 'SS'. The values of `n` and `xx[i][j]` remain unchanged.
