Postcondition: `x` is an array, and `a[i]` and `a[j]` are integers. If the value at index `j-1` in `x` is 'F', then `a[i]` is increased by 1 and `a[j]` is increased by 1. If the value at index `j-1` in `x` is 'S', then the value at index `j` in `x` remains 'S' and if the element at index `j` in `x` is not already incremented, it is incremented by 1.
