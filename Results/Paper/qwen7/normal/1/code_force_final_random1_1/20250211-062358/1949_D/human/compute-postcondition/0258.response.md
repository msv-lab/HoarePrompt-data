Postcondition: **`j` is 4, `n` remains the same, `xx[i][0]` is `'?'`, and `nx` is updated as follows: if `xx[i][3]` is not `'?'`, `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][3]`. Otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, `nx` is a string with an additional 'F' appended to it; otherwise, `nx` is a string with an additional 'S' appended to it.**
