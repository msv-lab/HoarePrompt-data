Postcondition: `nx` is either 'SS' or 'FS' or 'SF' or 'FF', `j` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 1) in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'.

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, stating that regardless of whether the condition `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'` is true or false, the final state of `nx`, `j`, and `n` will adhere to the specified conditions.
