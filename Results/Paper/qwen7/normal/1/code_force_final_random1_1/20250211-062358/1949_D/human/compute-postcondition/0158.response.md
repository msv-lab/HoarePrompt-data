Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since the loop starts at `j = 1`).

3. **Initial state of variables**:
   - `i` is 1 (not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 24.
   - `nx` is an empty string (not relevant to the loop execution).

4. **Determine necessary adjustments**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 1`, `n` must be at least 1. Given that `n` is already specified to be between 2 and 24, this condition is inherently satisfied.
   - The variable `j` is initialized to 1 within the loop itself, so no adjustment is needed for `j`.

5. **Conclusion**: The only variable that needs to be considered for the loop to execute is `n`, and since `n` is already constrained to be between 2 and 24, no further adjustment is necessary.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be between 2 and 24**
