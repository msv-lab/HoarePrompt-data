Output State: **`nx` is 'S' followed by either 'S' or 'Sxx[i][j - 1]' or 'Fxx[i][j - 1]', `j` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation: 
- The initial state of `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'.
- The line `nx += 'S'` appends 'S' to the end of `nx`.
- Since `nx` initially could be 'S' or 'F', appending 'S' to it results in 'S' followed by either 'S' or 'Sxx[i][j - 1]' or 'Fxx[i][j - 1]'.
- The value of `j` is incremented by 1 due to `j += 1`.
- The conditions related to `xx[i][j - 1]` and the quarters of `sb` do not affect the immediate outcome of `nx += 'S'`, so they remain as part of the initial conditions.
