Postcondition: `j` is within the range 1 to n, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, and `nx` is either incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', or is set to 'S' followed by the original value of `nx` if either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or is set to 'F' concatenated with the previous value of `nx` if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.
