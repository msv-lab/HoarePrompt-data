Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` should be within the range of the loop, which is from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - `n` is already given as an integer between 2 and 24.

3. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 1, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 1.

4. **Adjust the state of `n`**: The value of `n` should be within the specified range, but since the postcondition mentions `i` being `n + 1`, we need to ensure that `n` is such that `i` can reach `n + 1` within the loop. This means `n` must be at least 1, but since it is already given as an integer between 2 and 24, this condition is satisfied.

5. **Other variables**: The other variables (`j`, `sa`, `sb`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `n` should be within the range of 2 to 24.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24**.
