Reasoning:

1. **Functionality and Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input and initializes necessary variables to store counts of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario. This part is correct.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S'**: The function correctly accumulates the counts of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario, storing them in arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Categorizing Scenarios**: The function categorizes scenarios into two lists, `sa` and `sb`, based on whether they have more 'F' or 'S'. This step ensures that the logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to undecided transitions (`?`) is based on the majority of 'F' or 'S' in the initial data.

4. **Handling Undecided Transitions**: The function handles undecided transitions (`?`) by ensuring that the majority type (either 'F' or 'S') is used. This is done by checking if the current scenario or the destination scenario is in the majority list (`sa` or `sb`). This ensures that the condition of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type is met.

5. **Output Generation**: The function generates the final output by iterating over the input and replacing undecided transitions (`?`) with the appropriate type ('F' or 'S'). The logic ensures that the output respects the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Given the detailed analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The provided code meets all the requirements and constraints mentioned in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
