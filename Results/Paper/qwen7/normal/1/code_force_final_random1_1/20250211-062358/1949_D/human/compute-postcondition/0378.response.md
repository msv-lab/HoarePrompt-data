Functionality: **The function processes an input consisting of \( n \) lines, each containing \( n \) characters representing a partial transition video plan. Each character can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?', or '.' (no transition video specified). The function counts the cumulative occurrences of 'F' and 'S' for each position and categorizes positions into two lists: `sa` for positions with more 'F's than 'S's, and `sb` for positions with more 'S's than 'F's. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the function generates a string of 'F's; otherwise, it generates a string of 'S's. The function then prints the generated string.**
