Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` remains the same, `xx[i][0]` is `'?'`, and either `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`; `nx` is `'F'`**.

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `j`, `n`, and `xx[i][0]` remain unchanged. The condition about `i` or `j` being in the first quarter of `sa` also remains valid.
