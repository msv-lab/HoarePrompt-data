Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is either 1 or 2.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `xx[i][0]` is `'?'`.
   - `nx` is determined based on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, and at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is either 1 or 2, the next value of `j` will be 2 or 3 (if `n` is at least 3).
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `xx[i][0]` remains `'?'`.
   - `nx` will be recalculated based on the new value of `j`.

Given that `j` was either 1 or 2, the next value of `j` will be 3 if `n` is at least 3. Therefore, we need to consider both cases where `j` could be 3.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be 3 (since it starts from 2 and goes to `n`).
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `xx[i][0]` remains `'?'`.
   - `nx` will be recalculated based on whether `i` or `j` (now 3) is in the first quarter of `sa`.

Since `nx` depends on the values of `i` and `j`, and `j` is now 3, we need to consider the new value of `nx` based on the new `j` value.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is 3, `n` remains the same, `xx[i][0]` is `'?'`, and `nx` is determined as follows: if either `i` or 3 is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is `'F'`; otherwise, `nx` is a string with an additional 'S' appended to it.**
