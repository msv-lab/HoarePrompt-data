Output State: **`x` is an array where the value at index `j-1` is 'F', and the value of `a[i]` is increased by 1.**

The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of array `a` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the specific value of `a` or `i`, so we only know that the value at index `i` of array `a` has been increased by 1. The value at index `j-1` of array `x` remains 'F'.
