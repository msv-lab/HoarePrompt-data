Output State: **`n` is an input integer, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, but it does not affect any other variables. The precondition that at least half of the transition videos are decided and the rest are undecided remains unchanged. However, since the exact values of the characters in the transition video plan are not provided, they remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `n` now holds the value input by the user, which is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive.
