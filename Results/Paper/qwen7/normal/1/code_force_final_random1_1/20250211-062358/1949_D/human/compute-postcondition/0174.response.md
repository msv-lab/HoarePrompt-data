Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range specified by `range(1, n + 1)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value, and `n` was such that `j` was within the range.

3. **Update the State:**
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be the current value of `j` plus 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification of `n` is mentioned, it stays the same.

Given the postconditions and the loop head, let's update the state:

- `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'.
- `n` must be between 2 and 24.
- `xx[i][j - 1]` is either 'F' or 'S'.

Since `j` was in the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it `j + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`nx` is either 'F' or 'S', `n` must be between 2 and 24, and `xx[i][j]` is either 'F' or 'S'.**
