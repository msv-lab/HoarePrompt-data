Postcondition: `i` is 7, `n` is an integer between 7 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`, `sa` is a list containing the integers 6 and 7, `sb` is a list containing the integers 6 and 7, and if `b[7] > 0` and `a[7] == 0`, then no changes are made to `sb`; otherwise, `sb` remains unchanged as a list containing the integers 6 and 7.
