Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `len(ar) - 1`
- `mex` is unchanged
- `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`
- If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` remains `mex - ar[i]` and `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` and `res[i]` remain unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop starts from `i = len(ar) - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` becomes -1.
- The loop variable `i` is the only object in the loop head that changes with each iteration.

### Current State:
- `i` is currently `len(ar) - 1`.
- Since the loop is decrementing `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `len(ar) - 2`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` will be `len(ar) - 2`.
- `mex` remains unchanged.
- `res` remains a list of `None` values with length `n`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `mex` is unchanged, and `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`**
