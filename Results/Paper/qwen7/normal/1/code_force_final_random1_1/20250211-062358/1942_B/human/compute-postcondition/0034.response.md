Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, and `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Since `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, the value of `i` remains unchanged. Similarly, `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`, which is already given as the current value of `res[i]`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `mex`, which is now `mex - ar[i]`.
