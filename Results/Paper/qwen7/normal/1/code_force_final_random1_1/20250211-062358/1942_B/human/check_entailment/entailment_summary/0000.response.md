Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) from an array \( a \) such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

2. **Key Points in the Given Program**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes a result list `res` with `None` values.
   - It iterates backward through the array \( a \) and calculates \( res[i] \) as \( mex - a[i] \), where \( mex \) is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current adjusted list.

3. **Analysis of the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating \( mex \) in the reverse iteration ensures that the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of \( p \) is correctly determined.
   - By setting \( res[i] = mex - a[i] \), the program attempts to reconstruct the permutation \( p \).
   - The use of `mex` correctly handles the requirement of finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current list.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program should handle all valid permutations since it guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists.
   - The reverse iteration ensures that the smallest missing integer is correctly identified and used to form the permutation.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program logic aligns with the problem statement and correctly reconstructs the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).
   - The reverse iteration and calculation of \( mex \) ensure that the constraints and requirements are met.

Correctness: **True**
