Output State: **`mex` will be 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is calculated as `n - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `i` will be `-1`; `n` is now an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
