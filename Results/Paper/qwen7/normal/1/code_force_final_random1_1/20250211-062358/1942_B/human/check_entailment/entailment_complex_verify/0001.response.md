### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \).
   - The value of \( a_i \) is defined as \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
   - The MEX (Minimum EXcluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - We need to ensure that the constructed permutation \( p \) satisfies the condition for each \( a_i \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes a result list `res` with `None` values.
   - It calculates the MEX value for the remaining part of the permutation and updates the result list accordingly.

3. **Key Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic to calculate the MEX and update the permutation is flawed.
   - The code attempts to compute the MEX in reverse order but does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation.
   - The MEX calculation and updating of the permutation do not align with the problem requirements.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve constructing the permutation directly while ensuring the MEX condition is satisfied.
   - One common method is to use a greedy algorithm where we place the smallest available number that does not violate the MEX condition.

5. **Example Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the first test case: \( n = 5 \), \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \).
   - The expected permutation \( p \) is \( [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \).
   - The MEX values should be calculated as follows:
     - \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 \)
     - \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1]) - 1 = 1 \)
     - \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = -2 \)
     - \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 1 \)
     - \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 2 \)

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code states that the loop runs in reverse order, setting `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`.
   - However, the logic to update `mex` and ensure the correct permutation is not implemented correctly.
   - The `if` condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` does not serve the intended purpose of updating `mex` correctly.

7. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The code does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).
   - The logic to calculate the MEX and update the permutation is flawed and does not satisfy the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given code is incorrect because it does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).

### Final:
**False**
