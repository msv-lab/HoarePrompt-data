Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `mex` will be 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is calculated as `n - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `i` will be `-1` (though this value is not used outside the loop).**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `mex` variable will be reduced to 0 by subtracting each element of the `ar` list from it. The `res` list will contain the values `n - ar[i]` for each index `i` in the `ar` list. The variable `i` will be decremented until it reaches `-1`, but this value does not affect the final state of the `res` list or `mex`.
