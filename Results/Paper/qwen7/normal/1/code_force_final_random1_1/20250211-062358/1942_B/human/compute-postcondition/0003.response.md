Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `None`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `res` with `n` elements, all set to `None`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `ar` retains its original state as a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.
