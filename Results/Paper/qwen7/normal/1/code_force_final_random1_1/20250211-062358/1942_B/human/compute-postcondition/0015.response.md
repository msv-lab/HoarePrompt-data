Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `mex` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least one element
- `res` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `n - ar[i]`
- `i` is `len(ar) - 3`
- `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

2. **Current State of Variables**:
   - `i` is currently `len(ar) - 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` starts at `len(ar) - 3` and decreases by 1 in each iteration.
   - To continue the loop, `i` must be adjusted to `len(ar) - 4` (the next value).

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `mex`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `res` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body. Since the loop body is omitted, these variables stay the same.

### Updated State:
- `i` is now `len(ar) - 4`.
- `mex` remains `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`.
- `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `ar` remains a list of integers that must have at least one element.
- `res` remains a list of `n` elements, all set to `n - ar[i]`.
- `res[i]` remains `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`mex` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 4`, `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`.**
