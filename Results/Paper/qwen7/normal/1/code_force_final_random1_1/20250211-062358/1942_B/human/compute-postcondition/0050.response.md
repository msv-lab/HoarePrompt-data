Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 1`; `mex` is `n`; `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Since `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `res[i]` specifically becomes `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
