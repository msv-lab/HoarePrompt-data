Output State: **`mex` is `n`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`. Since `mex` is initially `n`, `res[i]` becomes `n - ar[i]`. The value of `i` is decremented by 1 because `i` was originally `len(ar) - 1`, so now `i` is `len(ar) - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
