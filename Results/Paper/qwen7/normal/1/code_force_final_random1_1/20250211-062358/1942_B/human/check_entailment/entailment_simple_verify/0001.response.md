### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \).
   - The value of \( a_i \) is defined as \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
   - The MEX (Minimum EXcluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - We need to ensure that the constructed permutation \( p \) satisfies the condition for each \( a_i \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes a result list `res` with `None` values.
   - It calculates the MEX value for the remaining part of the permutation and updates the result list accordingly.

3. **Key Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic to calculate the MEX and update the permutation is flawed.
   - The code attempts to compute the MEX in reverse order but does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation.
   - The MEX calculation and updating of the permutation do not align with the problem requirements.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve constructing the permutation directly while ensuring the MEX condition is satisfied.
   - One common method is to use a greedy algorithm where we place the smallest available number that does not violate the MEX condition.

5. **Example Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the first test case: \( n = 5 \), \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \).
   - The expected permutation \( p \) is \( [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \).
   - The MEX values should be calculated as follows:
     - \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 \)
     - \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1]) - 1 = 1 \)
     - \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = -2 \)
     - \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 1 \)
     - \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 2 \)

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code states that the loop runs in reverse order, setting each element of `res` based on the current `mex` value and the corresponding `a_i`.
   - However, the logic to update `mex` is flawed. The `if` condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is always true, and `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`, which is incorrect because `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array up to that point.

7. **Correct Implementation:**
   - A correct implementation would involve maintaining a set of used numbers and updating `mex` based on the current set of used numbers.
   - For each position `i`, we should find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set of used numbers and assign it to `res[i]`.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to construct the permutation properly and does not ensure the MEX condition is met for each element.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
