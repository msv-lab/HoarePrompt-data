Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `-1`, `mex` remains unchanged if it was never updated to a value greater than `mex - ar[i]` during any iteration, and each element in `res` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` where `i` ranges from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `-1`, indicating that the loop has finished. The `mex` (minimum excluded) value will retain its last known state unless it was updated to a larger value during the loop's execution. Each element in the `res` list will be set to `mex - ar[i]` for every index `i` starting from the last element of `ar` and moving backwards to the first element.
