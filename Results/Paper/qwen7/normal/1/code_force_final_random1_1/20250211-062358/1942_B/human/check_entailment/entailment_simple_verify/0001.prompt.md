You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ a_i ≤ n, and there exists at least one valid permutation p that satisfies the given conditions.

        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = [None] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):

            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `-1`, `mex` remains unchanged (it could be any non-negative integer depending on the input but will be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the adjusted list `ar`), `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`, and `ar` remains unchanged.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will become `-1` because the loop decrements `i` starting from `len(ar) - 1` until it reaches `-1`. The value of `mex` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is only modified within the if condition which does not alter `mex` if the condition is false. The list `res` is filled such that for each index `i`, `res[i]` equals `mex - ar[i]`. The list `ar` remains unaltered as it is not modified within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \).
   - The value of \( a_i \) is defined as \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
   - The MEX (Minimum EXcluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - We need to ensure that the constructed permutation \( p \) satisfies the condition for each \( a_i \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes a result list `res` with `None` values.
   - It calculates the MEX value for the remaining part of the permutation and updates the result list accordingly.

3. **Key Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic to calculate the MEX and update the permutation is flawed.
   - The code attempts to compute the MEX in reverse order but does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation.
   - The MEX calculation and updating of the permutation do not align with the problem requirements.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve constructing the permutation directly while ensuring the MEX condition is satisfied.
   - One common method is to use a greedy algorithm where we place the smallest available number that does not violate the MEX condition.

5. **Example Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the first test case: \( n = 5 \), \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \).
   - The expected permutation \( p \) is \( [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \).
   - The MEX values should be calculated as follows:
     - \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 \)
     - \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1]) - 1 = 1 \)
     - \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = -2 \)
     - \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 1 \)
     - \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 2 \)

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to construct the permutation properly and does not ensure the MEX condition is met for each element.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).
