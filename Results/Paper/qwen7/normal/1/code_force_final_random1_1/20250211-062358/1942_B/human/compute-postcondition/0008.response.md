Output State: **`mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, and `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Here, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, meaning `i` is the second-to-last index of the list `ar`. The value of `mex` is now `mex - ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
