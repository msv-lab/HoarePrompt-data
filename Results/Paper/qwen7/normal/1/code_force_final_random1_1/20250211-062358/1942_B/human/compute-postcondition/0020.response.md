Based on the initial state provided:

- `mex` will be 0 after the loop executes all iterations.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is calculated as `n - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- `i` will be `-1` (though this value is not used outside the loop).

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
```

Given that `res` is a list of `n` elements, each element being `n - ar[i]`, the `print` statement will join these elements into a single string with spaces between them.

Since the exact values of `n` and `ar` are not specified, we can only describe the general form of the output.

Output: **a space-separated string of n elements, each element being n minus the corresponding element in ar**
