Reasoning:
1. The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).
2. The logic of the program is to calculate each element of \( p \) from the end to the beginning using the formula \( p_i = \text{mex} - a_i \).
3. The variable `mex` is initialized to `n` and is updated only if the current `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest non-negative integer not present in the adjusted list `ar`.
4. The final values in `res` are correctly calculated according to the problem statement, ensuring that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:
- The `mex` calculation should be done after updating `res[i]` to ensure that the `mex` value reflects the correct state of the permutation up to that point.
- The current implementation updates `mex` before calculating `res[i]`, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this, we need to update `mex` after setting `res[i]` and ensure that `mex` reflects the correct state of the permutation up to that point.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect due to the flawed `mex` update logic.

Correctness: **False**
