Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly generate a valid permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). The logic in the loop is flawed, particularly in how it calculates and updates `mex`.

Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`**: The variable `mex` is supposed to represent the minimum non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of \( p \). However, the current implementation does not correctly update `mex` based on the values already placed in \( p \).

2. **Reversing the Loop**: The loop iterates in reverse order (`for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1)`), which is not appropriate for constructing the permutation \( p \) directly. Instead, we should iterate forward through the indices while maintaining the correct `mex` value.

3. **Updating `mex` Incorrectly**: The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is unnecessary and incorrect. It doesn't properly handle the update of `mex` based on the values already assigned to \( p \).

To fix this, we need to maintain a set of used numbers and calculate `mex` dynamically as we build the permutation \( p \).

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
```

This version correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) by ensuring that each element \( p_i \) is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used, adjusted by the value of \( a_i \).
