Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `len(ar) - 1`, `-1`, and `-1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`. The loop starts from `len(ar) - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` reaches `-1`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - `i`: This variable starts at `0` but the loop will start when `i` is set to `len(ar) - 1`.
   - `len(ar) - 1`: This is a constant derived from the length of the list `ar`. It does not change during the loop execution.
   - `-1`: This is the decrement value and does not need adjustment.
   - `-1`: This is the stop value and does not need adjustment.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `len(ar) - 1` at the start of the loop. Since `i` is initially `0`, we need to adjust it to `len(ar) - 1`.

4. **State the final state**:
   - `i` should be `len(ar) - 1`.
   - `mex` is `n` and does not change within the loop.
   - `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n` and does not change within the loop.
   - `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and its length is used in the loop condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `mex` is `n`, `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user**
