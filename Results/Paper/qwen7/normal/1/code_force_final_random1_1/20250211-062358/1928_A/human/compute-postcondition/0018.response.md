Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, and if both `a` and `b` are even, the function does not change `a` and `b`. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd, and the function ensures that the difference between `a` and `b` is not equal to zero and satisfies `(a - b) % 2 != 0`, or the difference between `a` and `b` is zero and satisfies `(a - b) % 2 == 0`.
