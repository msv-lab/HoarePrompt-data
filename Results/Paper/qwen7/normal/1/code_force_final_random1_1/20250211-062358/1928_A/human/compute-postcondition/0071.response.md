Postcondition: `t` is 9999, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input. If either `a` or `b` is even, then `a` and `b` are each divided by 2, resulting in `a1` and `b1` respectively, both being `a // 2` and `b // 2`. If `b1` (which is `b // 2`) is not equal to `a`, the condition holds as specified. Otherwise, `t` remains 9999, `_` remains 2, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
