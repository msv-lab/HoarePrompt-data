### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads two integers `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Conditions for Output**:
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle:
     - If both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`), it prints 'yes'.
     - If the difference between `a` and `b` is exactly equal to the smaller dimension (`(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`), it prints 'no'. This condition is incorrect and should be simplified to `a == b`.
     - If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd (`(a - b) % 2 != 0`), it prints 'yes'. This condition is also incorrect and should be simplified to `(a - b) % 2 > 0`.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Condition for Even Dimensions**:
   - The condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` is correct. If both dimensions are even, Bob can always split them into smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form another rectangle.

2. **Condition for Difference Equal to Smaller Dimension**:
   - The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect. It should be simply checking if `a == b` (i.e., the dimensions are equal).

3. **Condition for Odd Difference**:
   - The condition `(a - b) % 2 != 0` is incorrect. It should be `(a - b) % 2 > 0` to check if the difference is odd.

4. **General Case**:
   - The general case should handle all other scenarios where neither of the above conditions are met. However, the current implementation is flawed due to the incorrect conditions mentioned above.

#### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('no')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b) % 2 == 1:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the original program is incorrect. The corrected version provided above addresses the problems in the original conditions and ensures the program works as intended.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final: False**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the conditions in the original program were incorrect, leading to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.
