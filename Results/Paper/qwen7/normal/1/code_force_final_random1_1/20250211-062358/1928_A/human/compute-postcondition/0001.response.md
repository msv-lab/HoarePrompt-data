Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the specified range, while `a` and `b` are set to the first and second integers inputted respectively.
