The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2`.**
