Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- If `b` is even, `b` is divided by 2 and assigned to both `b1` and `b2`.
- If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the condition holds as is.

The print statement is `print('No')`.

Given this information, the print statement directly outputs the string `'No'`. There are no variables or conditions that would alter this output based on the provided initial state.

Output: **No**
