Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the input for the range function, which is an integer input.

2. **Determine the initial state**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is the first integer input.
   - `b` is the second integer input.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations. This means the loop will run as long as the input integer is non-negative and within the specified range.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `b` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

5. **Determine the new input for the loop**:
   - The new input for the loop will be the next integer input, which determines the number of iterations for the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should include:
- `t` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The new input for the loop will determine the number of iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
