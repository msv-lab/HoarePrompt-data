Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is explicitly defined as 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input.
- `b1` is defined as `b // 2`.
- `b2` is defined as `b // 2`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
