### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided function step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b`.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: If both `a` and `b` are even, the function prints 'yes'. This is correct because an even-sized rectangle can always be split into smaller even-sized rectangles, allowing for the formation of another rectangle.
   - **Case 2**: If `a` and `b` differ by exactly `a` or `b` (i.e., `a - b == -a` or `b - a == -b`), the function prints 'no'. This is incorrect because it checks if `a - b` is equal to `-a` or `-b`, which is not a valid condition. Instead, it should check if `a - b == 0` (i.e., `a == b`), meaning the rectangle is a square, and squares cannot form another rectangle unless they are split into smaller squares.
   - **Case 3**: If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, the function prints 'yes'. This is incorrect because the presence of an odd difference does not guarantee that a new rectangle can be formed. For example, a 3x5 rectangle can be split into 3x2 and 3x3, but neither can form a new rectangle without further splitting.
   - **Case 4**: The default case prints 'no', which is also incorrect because it doesn't handle the general case where a new rectangle can be formed.

### Correct Implementation:
A more accurate approach would be:
- Check if either `a` or `b` is 1 (since a 1xN rectangle can only form a 1xM rectangle).
- Check if `a` and `b` are both even (since an even-sized rectangle can always be split into smaller even-sized rectangles).
- Check if `a` and `b` are both odd (since an odd-sized rectangle cannot be split into smaller odd-sized rectangles without forming a square, which is not allowed).

### Revised Function:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('yes')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')
```

### Conclusion:
The provided function is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling the cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
