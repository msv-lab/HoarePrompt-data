Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` and its helper functions do not ensure that the array is maximized to the full potential allowed by the operations. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Base Case Handling**: The function `func_1` does not handle the base case properly. When `l == r`, it should directly check if `a[l]` is 0 and update it if necessary. However, the current implementation sets `a[l]` to 0 and then calls itself recursively, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. This condition is too restrictive and does not always lead to the optimal solution. For example, consider an array `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The function might not correctly identify that setting all elements to 100 would yield a higher sum.

3. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` applies operations but does not always choose the optimal value to set the subarray to. It uses the maximum value in the subarray but does not consider the possibility of setting all elements to a smaller value that could still maximize the sum.

To illustrate, let's consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

However, the provided program might not produce this output because it does not correctly handle the operations to maximize the sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not guarantee the optimal solution for all inputs.
