The function processes a list `a` of non-negative integers and updates it based on the indices `l` and `r`. It appends operations to the list `ops` that describe the changes made. Specifically, if `a[l]` is not zero and within the range `[l, r]`, it sets `a[l]` to zero and records the operation. If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it updates all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation. The function recursively processes the subarray defined by `l + 1` to `r`.
