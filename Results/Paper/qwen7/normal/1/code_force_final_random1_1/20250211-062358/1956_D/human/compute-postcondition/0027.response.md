Postcondition: **`s` is the sum of elements from index `l` to index `r` inclusive in list `a`. If `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, then `i` will be `r + 1`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and all elements from index `l` to index `r` in list `a` will be set to the value `r - l + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and if `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.**
