Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an array `a` of integers.
   - We can perform operations where we choose a subarray `[l, r]` and set all elements in this subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - Setting a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray can help increase the overall sum of the array.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function recursively sets the entire subarray from `l` to `r` to the MEX value of that subarray.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if the element is not 0 and sets it to 0 if true.
   - This function is used to update the array during the operations.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - It returns the sum of the array and the number of operations performed.

5. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:**
   - This function is supposed to maximize the sum of the subarray `[l, r]`.
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray and compares it with \((r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)\).
     - If the sum is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)\), it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to the MEX value.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays before and after the position of the maximum value.

6. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result along with the operations.

### Verification of Correctness

- **Base Case Handling:** The base case handling in `func_1` ensures that individual elements are correctly updated.
- **Recursive Logic:** The recursive logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` seems to handle the subarray updates correctly by considering the sum and MEX values.
- **Operations Count:** The operations count is managed within the constraints, ensuring no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) operations are used.
- **Sum Calculation:** The sum calculation in `func_2` is correct and reflects the updated array state.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the functions and their interactions, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array using the allowed operations.

**Correctness: True**
