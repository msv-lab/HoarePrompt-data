Output State: `ops` is a list that contains exactly as many tuples as the number of iterations the loop has executed.

In Natural Language: The `ops` list will contain a tuple for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop has executed all its iterations, `ops` will have a number of tuples equal to the total number of iterations the loop was designed to run.
