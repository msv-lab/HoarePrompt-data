Output State: **`s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`.**

Explanation: The code finds the position of the maximum value (`mx`) within the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and adds `l` to it to get the position `pos` in the original list `a`. The values of `s` and `mx` remain unchanged.
