The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two parameters: `l` (a list of non-negative integers) and `r` (a list used to store operations). The list `l` contains non-negative integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 18, inclusive, and each element in the list is between 0 and \(10^7\), inclusive. The list `r` is used to store operations performed during the process.

The function returns the maximum possible sum that can be achieved by performing certain operations on the elements of list `l`, as recorded in list `r`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `l` containing non-negative integers and a list `r` to store operations. It returns the maximum possible sum achievable by performing operations on the elements of `l` as specified in `r`.**
