Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for (l, r) in ops:
   ```
   The variables in the loop head are `(l, r)` and `ops`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are tuples in the list `ops`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ops` is a list that must contain at least one tuple.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must still contain at least one tuple.
   - After processing one tuple from `ops`, `ops` will have at least one fewer tuple than before.

5. **Determine the New State**:
   - Since we are removing one tuple from `ops` during each iteration, `ops` must still contain at least one tuple for the loop to continue.
   - Therefore, `ops` should be a list containing at least one tuple, but it will have one fewer tuple than it did at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the above reasoning, the new state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ops` is a list that must contain at least one tuple**
