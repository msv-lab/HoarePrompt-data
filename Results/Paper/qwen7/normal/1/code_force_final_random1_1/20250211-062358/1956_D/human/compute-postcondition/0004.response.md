Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the tuple `(l, r)` which is being iterated over from the `ops` list. Therefore, the variables involved are `l`, `r`, and `ops`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ops`**: The variable `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(l, r)`. For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one such tuple.

3. **Initial State of `l` and `r`**: Since `l` and `r` are the elements of the tuples in `ops`, they will be initialized as part of the tuples within `ops`. Hence, the initial values of `l` and `r` are not directly set but are derived from the tuples in `ops`.

4. **State Adjustments**: We need to ensure that `ops` contains at least one tuple to allow the loop to execute. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `s`, `m`, and `ops`) do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `ops` to ensure it contains at least one tuple.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ops` is a list that must contain at least one tuple**
