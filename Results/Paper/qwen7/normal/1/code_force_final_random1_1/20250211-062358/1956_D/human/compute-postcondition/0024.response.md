Output State: **Postcondition: `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. `pos` is not equal to `r`, and the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` calls the function `recursive_maximize_sum` with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`. This does not change the values of `s`, `mx`, `pos`, `l`, or `r`. Therefore, the postconditions remain the same as the initial state, except for the addition of the call to the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)`.
