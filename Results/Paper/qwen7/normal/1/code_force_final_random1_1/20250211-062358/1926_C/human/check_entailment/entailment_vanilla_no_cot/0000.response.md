Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect and inefficient for solving the given problem:

1. **Pre-computation**: The program pre-computes the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`. This is unnecessary and inefficient because the input size can be up to \(2 \times 10^5\), and the pre-computed values are not needed for each test case individually.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of digits of a number. However, it is used in a way that does not optimize the solution.

3. **Incorrect Approach**: Instead of pre-computing, the program should directly calculate the sum of digit sums for each test case. This approach is more efficient and aligns with the problem requirements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digits(num):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))

t = int(input())
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    total_sum = sum(sum_of_digits(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
    results.append(total_sum)

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This version directly computes the sum of digit sums for each number from 1 to \(n\) for each test case, which is both correct and efficient.
