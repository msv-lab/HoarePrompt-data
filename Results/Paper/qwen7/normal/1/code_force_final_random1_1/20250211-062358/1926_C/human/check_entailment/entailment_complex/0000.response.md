Reasoning:
- The provided code initializes an array `A` and a variable `sum` to store intermediate results, which is unnecessary for solving the problem. Instead, the code should directly compute the required sum for each test case without precomputing values for all numbers up to 200,000.
- The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of digits of a given number.
- The main part of the program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1` for each number from 1 to `n` and accumulating the results. However, this approach is inefficient due to repeated computation for each test case.
- A more efficient approach would be to compute the sum of transformed numbers for each test case independently without storing intermediate results.

Given these observations, the current implementation is not optimal but still logically correct for the problem statement. However, it can be optimized to avoid redundant computations.

Correctness: **False**
