Output State: **`a` is equal to `2 * (num % 10)`, `num` is a positive integer such that 0 <= num <= 20000 and `num` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `a` by adding `num % 10` to its current value. Since `a` was initially equal to `num % 10`, the new value of `a` becomes `a + num % 10`, which simplifies to `2 * (num % 10)`. The other variables (`num`) remain unchanged, and the condition that `num` is a positive integer such that 0 <= num <= 20000 and `num` must be greater than 0 still holds.
