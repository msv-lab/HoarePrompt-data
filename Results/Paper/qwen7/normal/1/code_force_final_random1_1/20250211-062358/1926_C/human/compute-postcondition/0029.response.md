Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in str(i):`. This means the loop variable `j` is derived from the string representation of `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is "400003"
   - `j` is "0" (since it's the first character of `str(i)`)
   - `pd['400003']` is 400007 (this is derived from `int('400003') + 4`)

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `str(i)`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `j` will be the next character in `str(i)`.
   - `pd['400003']` is already updated and does not change within the loop.

Given that `j` is currently "0" and the next character in `str(i)` is "4", the new state will be:

- `i` remains "400003".
- `j` changes to "4".
- `pd['400003']` remains 400007.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is "400003", `j` is "4", `pd['400003']` is 400007**
