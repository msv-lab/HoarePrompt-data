The only variable in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the integer value of `num` divided by 10. For the loop to be executed one more time, `num` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `num` to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`a` is equal to `num` modulo 10, `num` is a positive integer such that 0 <= num <= 20000 and `num` must be greater than 0**
