Output State: **`i` is "400003", `j` is "0", `pd['400003']` is `int('400003') + 4`, `pd['400003']` is 400007**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pd['400003']` by adding the integer value of `j` (which is 0) to its current value (`int('400003') + 4`). Since `int('400003')` is 400003, adding 0 to it does not change its value, but the expression `int('400003') + 4` remains as 400007. All other variables remain unchanged.
