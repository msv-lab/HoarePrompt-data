Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in str(i):`. This means the loop will iterate over each character in the string representation of `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` is initially "400003".
   - `j` is initially "0".
   - `pd['400003']` is 8.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop will start with `j` being the first character of `str(i)`, which is "4".
   - After the first iteration, `j` will be "0" (the second character of `str(i)`).

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the characters of `str(i)`, the initial value of `j` should be the first character of `str(i)`, which is "4".
   - The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is the input to the loop, and its string representation will be used for iteration.
   - The variable `pd['400003']` is not directly involved in the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should remain "400003".
- `j` should be "4".

**State: **`i` is "400003", `j` is "4"**
