Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a, b)` plus the new element which is `winner`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)**.

This means that the `results` list has been updated by appending the `winner` value, which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `winner` remain unchanged from their initial states.
