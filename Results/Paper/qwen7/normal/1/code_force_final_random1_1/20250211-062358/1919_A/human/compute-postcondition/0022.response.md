Output State: **`t` is 0, `results` is a list of 1000 elements, each being the result of calling `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of integers input during the loop's iterations.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because the range function starts at a value between 1 and 1000 and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The `results` list will contain 1000 elements, each being the result of calling `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of integers input during the loop's iterations.
