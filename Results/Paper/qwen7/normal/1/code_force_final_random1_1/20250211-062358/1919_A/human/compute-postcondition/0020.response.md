Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved here are `result` and `results`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the `results` list to iterate over. Since `result` is set to the second element in the `results` list at the end of the previous iteration, it means the loop has already processed the first element.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**: For the loop to execute one more time, `result` should be set to the next element in the `results` list. Since `result` was the second element, the next element would be the third element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `result` should now be the third element in the `results` list.
   - `results` remains the same list but is now one element shorter because the second element has been processed.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`result` is the third element in the `results` list**
