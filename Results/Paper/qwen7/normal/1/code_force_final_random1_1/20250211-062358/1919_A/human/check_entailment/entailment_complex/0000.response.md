Reasoning:
1. **Problem Description Analysis**: The problem describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing one coin from their wallets, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses. The key to determining the winner lies in the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets.
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: This function correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets. If the sum is even, `func_1` returns 'Bob', indicating that Bob would win if both play optimally. If the sum is odd, `func_1` returns 'Alice', indicating that Alice would win under the same conditions.
3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**: This function correctly processes the test cases as per the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
4. **Overall Program Correctness**: Given that `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins, and `func_2` correctly processes and prints the results for each test case, the overall program meets the requirements of the problem.

Conclusion:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct.
- The logic in `func_2` is correct.
- The program as a whole correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
