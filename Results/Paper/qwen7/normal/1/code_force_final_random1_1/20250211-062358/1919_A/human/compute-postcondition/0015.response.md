Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, `results` is a list containing 1000 elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. The variable `a` represents the first integer input for each iteration, `b` represents the second integer input for each iteration, and `winner` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration and is the last element in the `results` list.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because the range function will stop once it reaches `t` (which starts at a value between 1 and 1000 and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0). The `results` list will contain 1000 elements, each being the result of calling `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of integers input during the loop's iterations.
