Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a, b)` plus the new element which is `winner`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, and `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `results`, `a`, `b`, and `winner` remain as per the initial state, but now `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input.
