Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a, b)` plus the new element which is `winner`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` and is also the last element in the `results` list.**

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_1(a, b)` to the variable `winner`. This means `winner` now holds the result of `func_1(a, b)`, and this value is added to the `results` list. The values of `t`, `results`, `a`, `b`, and the new value of `winner` are updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
