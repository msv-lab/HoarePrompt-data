State: **`t` must be a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, results is an empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains two objects: `_` (a placeholder variable) and `t`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
3. Since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, it must be within this range for the loop to execute.
4. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution condition.
5. The variable `results` is not relevant to the loop's execution condition and remains as given (an empty list).

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `t` to ensure it is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `results` remains an empty list.
