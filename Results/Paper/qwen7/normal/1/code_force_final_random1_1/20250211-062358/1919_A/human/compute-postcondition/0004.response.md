Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `results` is an empty list, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**.

This means that the function `func_1(a, b)` has been called with the inputs `a` and `b`, and its return value has been assigned to the variable `winner`. The values of `t`, `results`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
