Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `results` is an empty list, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**

The code `a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())` reads two integers from the user input, splits them based on whitespace, and converts them to integers. It then assigns these integers to `a` and `b`. The initial state of `t` and `results` remains unchanged.
