Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of coins Alice and Bob have in their wallets.
- The key observation is that the game essentially boils down to the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets. If the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This is because the game involves alternating moves, and the parity of the sum changes with each move. If the sum starts even, it will remain even after Alice's move (since she removes a coin), and Bob will make the next move with an even sum, ensuring he can always respond to Alice's moves until the end.
- The `func_1` function correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and returning the appropriate winner.
- The `func_2` function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1(a, b)` and printing the results. It correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the winners as required.
- Given that both functions work as intended and correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
