### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`. It also correctly parses the positions `a` and times `b`.
   - **Correct**: The parsing logic is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and `b` and stores them in `ad` and `bd` respectively.
   - **Correct**: The distances are correctly calculated and stored.

3. **Speed Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the speed between consecutive points using the formula `speed = distance / time` and stores these speeds in the list `v`.
   - **Correct**: The speeds are correctly calculated and stored.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where the query point `ql` lies.
   - **Correct**: The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate for finding the correct segment.
   - If `ql` exactly matches a known position in `a`, it directly outputs the corresponding time from `b`.
   - **Correct**: This handling is appropriate and ensures correct output when `ql` is an exact match.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the remaining distance within the identified segment and computes the total time taken to reach `ql`.
   - **Correct**: The calculation of the remaining distance and the total time is accurate.

5. **Time Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the time taken to travel the remaining distance within the identified segment and adds this to the time taken to reach the previous known position. The result is then rounded down to the nearest integer.
   - **Correct**: The rounding down is handled correctly, ensuring the output is as required.

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the results for each query in the required format.
   - **Correct**: The output formatting is correct and follows the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
After carefully analyzing the program against the problem description and the annotated code, it is evident that the program correctly implements the logic described. There are no logical errors or omissions in the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
