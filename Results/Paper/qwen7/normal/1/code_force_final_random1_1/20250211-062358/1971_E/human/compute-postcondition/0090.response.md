Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and the list `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(b)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - The list `bd` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body and its definition does not depend on `i`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `bd` remains as a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`**
