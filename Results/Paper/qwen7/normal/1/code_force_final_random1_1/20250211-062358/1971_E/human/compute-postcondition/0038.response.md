Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `l` is 0
   - `m` is 0
   - `s` is `bisect_left(a, ql)`
   - The current value of `a[s]` is equal to `ql`

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(b[s], end=' ')`

From the initial state, we know:
- `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, which means `s` is the index in list `a` where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list sorted.
- The value of `a[s]` is equal to `ql`.

However, the variable `b` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its contents directly from the given information. Since `b[s]` is what we need to print, and without knowing the content of `b`, we can only refer to it as `b[s]`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `b[s]`.

Output: **b[s]**
