The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is 0, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer, `l` is `q + 1`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`**
