Output State: **`a` is updated to a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input, `l` is `len(a) - 1`, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (a[len(a) - 1] - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]`, `i` is `1`, `ql` is `q - a[s - 1]`, `s` is `bisect_left(a, q)`, `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))**, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `b` by taking the first element as 0 and appending the integers from the input. All other variables remain unchanged except for `b`, which now includes the newly added list of integers.
