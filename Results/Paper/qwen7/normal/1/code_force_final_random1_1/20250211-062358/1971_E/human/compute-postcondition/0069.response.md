Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is `b[s - 1]`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `m` is incremented by the value of `b[s - 1]`. The other variables (`i`, `l`, and `ql`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `l` remains 2, `m` becomes `b[s - 1]`, and `ql` remains `ql - a[s - 1]`.
