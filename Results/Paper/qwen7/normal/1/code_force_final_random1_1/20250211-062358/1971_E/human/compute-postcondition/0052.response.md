Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is 0, we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop continues, the values of `i`, `l`, and `m` remain unchanged. The only impact is that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.
