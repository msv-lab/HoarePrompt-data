Let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `m` step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `q` is equal to `len(a)`, but the value of `a` is not explicitly given.
   - `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, where `ql` is an input integer reduced by `a[s - 1]`.
   - `l` is `q + 1`.

2. **Calculation of `m`:**
   - `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`.
   - Here, `b`, `bd`, and `ad` are lists, and `s` is determined by the `bisect_left` function, which returns the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list sorted.

3. **Understanding `ql`:**
   - `ql` is an input integer reduced by `a[s - 1]`. This means `ql = input_integer - a[s - 1]`.

4. **Value of `m`:**
   - Since the exact values of `b`, `bd`, and `ad` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `m`. However, we know that `m` is composed of the last element of `b` before `s`, the value at position `s` of `bd`, and a fraction involving `ql` and the value at position `s` of `ad`.

Given this breakdown, the print statement will output the integer part of `m`.

Output: **int(b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s]))**
