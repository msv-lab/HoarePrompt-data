Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `s` is `bisect_left(a, ql)` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
