Output State: **`i` is 3; `v` contains the value `ad[2] / bd[2]`**

Explanation: The code `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])` appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Given that `i` is initially 2, the expression `ad[i] / bd[i]` becomes `ad[2] / bd[2]`. After executing this line, `i` is incremented (assuming `i` is incremented after the append operation), making `i` equal to 3. The value of `v` now includes the computed value. The precondition that `len(b)` must be at least 1 remains valid, but since no changes were made to `b`, it is not explicitly updated in the output state.
