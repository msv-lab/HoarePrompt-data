Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `len(a)`, `v` contains the list `[ad[2] / bd[2], ad[4] / bd[4], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`.

In this final output state, the variable `i` has been incremented to `len(a)`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The list `v` contains the accumulated results of the division operation `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each iteration of the loop, starting from `i = 2` up to `i = len(a) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` is `m + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])`, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer reduced by `a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q + 1`, and if `a[s]` equals `ql`, the condition is met as is; otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
