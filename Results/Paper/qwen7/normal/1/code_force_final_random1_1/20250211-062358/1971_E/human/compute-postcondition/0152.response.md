Output State: **`ad` has had its last element updated to `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Since the initial values of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are not specified, the output state only indicates that the last element of `ad` has been updated to this difference. The values of `a` and any other variables not involved in this operation remain unchanged.
