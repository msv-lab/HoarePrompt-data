Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is assigned the value of `int(input())`, n, k, and q are integers, a is a list of k integers, b is a list of k integers, d is a list of q integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
        print(int(m), end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `len(b) + len(a) - 1`, `l` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the result of adding `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` for each iteration from `0` to `len(a) - 1`, and `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]` for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final value of `l` will be `len(a) - 1`, `m` will be `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (a[len(a) - 1] - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]`, `i` will be `1`, `ql` will be `q - a[s - 1]`, and `s` will be `bisect_left(a, q)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `len(a)`, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])` for each iteration, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)` for the last iteration, `ql` is the final input integer reduced by `a[s - 1]`, and `l` is `q + (len(a) - 1)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
