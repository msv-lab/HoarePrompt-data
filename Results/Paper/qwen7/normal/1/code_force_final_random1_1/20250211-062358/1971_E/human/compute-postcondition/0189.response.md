Output State: **`m` is `m + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])`, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]`**.

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` to its current value. The other variables (`q`, `s`, and `ql`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
