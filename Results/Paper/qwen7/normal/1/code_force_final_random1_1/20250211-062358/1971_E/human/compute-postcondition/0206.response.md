Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is 0, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer, `l` is `q + 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `ql`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `m`, `q`, `s`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `ql` is the integer input provided by the user.
