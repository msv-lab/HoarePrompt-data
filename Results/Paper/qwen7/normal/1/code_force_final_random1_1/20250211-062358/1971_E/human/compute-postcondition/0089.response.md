Output State: **`i` is 2; `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the current element `b[i]` and the previous element `b[i-1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is initially 1, after executing `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])`, `i` is incremented to 2 (though not explicitly shown in the code, it's implied by the index used), and `bd` now contains the value `b[1] - b[0]`. The condition that `len(b)` must be at least 2 remains valid.
