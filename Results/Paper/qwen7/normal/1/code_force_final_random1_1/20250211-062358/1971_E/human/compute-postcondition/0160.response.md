Output State: **`i` is 2; `bd` is a list with one element equal to `b[1] - b[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the current element `b[i]` and the previous element `b[i-1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the code calculates `b[1] - b[0]` and appends this value to `bd`. After executing the code, `i` is incremented (though not explicitly shown in the code snippet, the next operation would likely involve `i` being updated to 2), and `bd` contains the calculated difference. The precondition that `len(b)` must be greater than 1 remains valid.
