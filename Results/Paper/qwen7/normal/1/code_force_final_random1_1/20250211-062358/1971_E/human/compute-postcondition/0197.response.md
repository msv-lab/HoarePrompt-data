The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the variables `i`, `m`, `q`, `s`, `ql`, `l` retain their previous values, and the `continue` statement does not change any of them. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is 0, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer, `l` is `q`.**
