Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the `range` function.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `len(b)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(b)`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(b)` for the loop to execute.

4. **Check the Given State:**
   - We know that `ad` is a list containing differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting from the second element. The length of `ad` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - This information about `ad` is not directly relevant to the loop condition involving `b`.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and runs until `i < len(b)`, the initial value of `i` should be set to `1`.
   - The condition `i < len(b)` must hold true for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `i` should be `1`.
- `len(b)` must be greater than `1` (since `i` starts at `1` and goes up to but does not include `len(b)`).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `len(b)` must be greater than 1**
