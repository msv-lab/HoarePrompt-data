Output State: **`ad` has had its last element updated to `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 3, `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is appended to `ad`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[2]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`. Therefore, `a[2] - a[1]` is appended to `ad`. The length of `ad` increases by one, and `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
