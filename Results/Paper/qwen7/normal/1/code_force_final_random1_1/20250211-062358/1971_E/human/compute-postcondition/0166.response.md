Output State: `i` is `len(b)`; `bd` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, starting from the second element, up to the last element of `b`. Specifically, `bd` will have `len(b) - 1` elements, where each element is calculated as `b[j] - b[j - 1]` for `j` ranging from `1` to `len(b) - 1`.
