Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers inputted separated by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers inputted separated by spaces, `ad` is a list containing only one element which is 0, `bd` is a list containing only one element which is 0.**

The code simply initializes `bd` as a list containing a single element `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
