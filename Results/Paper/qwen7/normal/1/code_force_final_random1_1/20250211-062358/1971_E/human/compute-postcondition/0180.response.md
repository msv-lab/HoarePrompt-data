Output State: **`m` is 0, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `ql` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `ql`. The values of `m` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states. The length of list `a` is still referenced by `q`, but its value is not updated since `a` itself is not modified.
