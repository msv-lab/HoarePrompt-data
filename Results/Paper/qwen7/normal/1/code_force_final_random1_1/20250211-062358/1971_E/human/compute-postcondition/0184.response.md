Output State: **`m` is 0, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and the current value of `a[s]` is equal to `ql`. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables and the loop continues, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement.
