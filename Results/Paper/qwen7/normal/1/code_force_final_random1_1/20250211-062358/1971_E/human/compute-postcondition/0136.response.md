Output State: **`q` is `len(a) - q`, `l` is `2`, `m` is `0`, `i` is `1`, `s` is `bisect_left(a, ql)`, we continue to the next iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables within the `continue` statement itself, the values of `q`, `l`, `m`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement also indicates that the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
