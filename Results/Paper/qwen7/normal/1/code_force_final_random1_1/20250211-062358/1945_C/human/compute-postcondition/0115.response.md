Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `zero` is 1
   - `one` is 2
   - `zero_perc` is 0
   - `one_perc` is calculated as `((o - 2) * 100) // (n - 2)`
   - `lst` is `[2]`

4. **Calculate `one_perc`**: Given `o = 2` and `n > 0`, the calculation for `one_perc` is:
   \[
   \text{one\_perc} = \left(\frac{(2 - 2) \times 100}{n - 2}\right) = \frac{0 \times 100}{n - 2} = 0
   \]

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is 2, `n - 1` must be greater than 2, meaning `n` must be greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3.

7. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `lst`) do not change based on the loop condition and will retain their current values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `zero` is 1, `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 0, and `one_perc` is 0, and `lst` is [2]**.
