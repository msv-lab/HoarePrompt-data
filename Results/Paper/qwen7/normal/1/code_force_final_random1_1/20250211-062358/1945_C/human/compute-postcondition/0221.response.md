Output State: **`pk` is an integer, `elem` is the next integer in `lst`, `mini` is an integer, `final` is a list containing the element `elem` and an additional element `elem`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `final` initially contains the element `elem`, after appending `elem` again, `final` will contain two elements, both of which are `elem`. The values of `pk`, `mini`, and the nature of `elem` (as the next integer in `lst`) remain unchanged.
