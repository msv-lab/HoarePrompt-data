Output State: **`i` is 4; `lst` contains the element 4; `zero` is either 3 or 2; `zero_perc` is 60; `one_perc` is -66.67; `one` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0'**

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is initially 3, `i + 1` equals 4. Thus, `lst` now contains the element 4. The values of `zero`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `one` remain unchanged unless `s[i]` is not '0', in which case `one` would be increased by 1. Since the problem does not specify the content of `s[i]`, we assume `s[i]` is '0' unless otherwise stated, meaning `one` remains unchanged.
