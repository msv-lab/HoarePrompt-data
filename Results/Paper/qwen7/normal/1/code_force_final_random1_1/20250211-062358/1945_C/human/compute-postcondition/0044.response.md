Output State: **All indices `i` in the range of `n-1` have been iterated over, so `i` will be equal to `n-1`. `zero` will be the total count of '0's in the string `s`, and `one` will be the total count of '1's in the string `s`. `zero_perc` will be `zero * 100 // n` and `one_perc` will be `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n-1) - 1)` or simplified as `(o - one) * 100 // 0`, which will result in an error due to division by zero. However, assuming no division by zero occurs, `zero_perc` will be `zero * 100 // n` and `one_perc` will be `(o - one) * 100 // (n - n + 1)` or `o - one * 100`. `lst` will contain all indices `i + 1` where the conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` were met during the loop iterations.**

This means that after all iterations, `zero` and `one` will reflect the total counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, respectively. The percentage calculations will be based on the entire length of the string `s`, and `lst` will include all positions where these conditions were satisfied throughout the loop's execution.
