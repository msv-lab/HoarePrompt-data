Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `pk` will be an integer representing half of the total input integer `t` (rounded down if `t` is odd). The variable `mini` will be an integer representing the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`. The list `final` will contain the smallest element from `lst` that has the minimum absolute difference with `pk`. If no such element exists in `lst`, `final` will either contain 0 if the percentage of '1's in the string `s` is 50% or more, or it will contain `t` if the percentage of '1's is less than 50%.**

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables `pk`, `mini`, and `final` after the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `pk` is determined based on the initial input `t`. The value of `mini` is the smallest absolute difference found between `pk` and the positions in the string `s` where the percentage of '0's up to that position is at least 50% and the percentage of '1's from that position to the end is also at least 50%. The list `final` contains the position that achieves this minimum difference, or 0 or `t` based on the percentage of '1's in the string `s`.
