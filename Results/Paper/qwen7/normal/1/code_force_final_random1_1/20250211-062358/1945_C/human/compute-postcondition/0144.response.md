Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`, and `final` is a list containing all elements `elem` from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `mini` will still hold the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`. The `final` list will contain every element from `lst` that has the smallest difference (`mini`) when compared to `pk`. This means `final` will include all elements from `lst` that are closest to `pk` based on the absolute difference.
