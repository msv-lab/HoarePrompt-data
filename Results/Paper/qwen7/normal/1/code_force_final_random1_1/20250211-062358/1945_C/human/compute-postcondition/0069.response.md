Output State: **`mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum value of `mini` when subtracted from `pk`, and `final` is sorted; `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.**

In this output state, the variable `c1` is assigned the value of `o * 100 // n`. The other variables (`mini`, `final`, `pk`, `lst`, and `o`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
