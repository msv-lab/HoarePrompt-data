Output State: **`mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum value of `mini` when subtracted from `pk`, and `final` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. The values of `mini` and `lst` remain unchanged, and `final` now contains the elements from `lst` that have the minimum value of `mini` when subtracted from `pk`, and these elements are sorted.
