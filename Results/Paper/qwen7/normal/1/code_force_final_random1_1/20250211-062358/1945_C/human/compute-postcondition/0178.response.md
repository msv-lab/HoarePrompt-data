Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is -100**

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. However, the variables `o` and `one` are not defined in the initial state, so they are considered as undefined. Given the initial state, `one_perc` would be calculated as `(undefined - undefined) * 100 // (n - 1 - 1)`, which simplifies to `0 * 100 // (n - 2)`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, `n - 2` could be negative, leading to a division by a negative number, resulting in a negative value. Given the initial conditions and the absence of specific values for `o` and `one`, the calculation results in `-100` assuming the simplest case where `o` and `one` are both 0. Therefore, `one_perc` is set to `-100`. All other variables remain unchanged.
