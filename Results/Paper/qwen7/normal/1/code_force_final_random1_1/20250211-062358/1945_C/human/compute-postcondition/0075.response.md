Postcondition: `mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum value of `mini` when subtracted from `pk`, and `final` is sorted. If `len(final)` is 0, then `final` includes 0 if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` contains an additional element `n` and `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.
