Postcondition: `mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, where `lst` is a list with at least 4 elements, and `elem` is the second element of `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, then `final` is a list with its first element being the second element of `lst`.
