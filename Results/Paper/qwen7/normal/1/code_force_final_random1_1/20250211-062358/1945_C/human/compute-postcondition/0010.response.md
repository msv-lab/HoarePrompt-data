Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `pk` is `n / 2`, `s` is a string input by the user, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`**.

The code `sl = list(s)` converts the string `s` into a list of its characters and assigns this list to the variable `sl`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `pk`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
