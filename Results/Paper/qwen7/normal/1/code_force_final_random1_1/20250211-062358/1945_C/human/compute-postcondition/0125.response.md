Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.**

Explanation: The line of code updates `mini` to be the smaller of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Since the initial values of `mini`, `pk`, and `ele` are not specified, we can only say that `mini` is now the minimum value between its original value and `abs(pk - ele)`.
