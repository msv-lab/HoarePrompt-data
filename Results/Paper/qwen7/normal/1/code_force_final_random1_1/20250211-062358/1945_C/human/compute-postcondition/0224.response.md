Output State: **`pk` is an integer, `mini` is an integer, and `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `pk` retains its final value, `mini` also retains its final value after being updated in each iteration, and `final` is a list that contains every element `elem` from the list `lst` for which the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini` is true.
