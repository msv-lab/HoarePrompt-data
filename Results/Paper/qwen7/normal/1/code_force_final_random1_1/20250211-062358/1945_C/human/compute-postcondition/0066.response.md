Output State: **`mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `lst` is a list with at least 4 elements, and `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum value of `mini` when subtracted from `pk`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `mini` will still hold the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for any `ele` in `lst`. The variable `lst` will retain its state from after the third iteration, meaning it has at least 4 elements. The `final` list will contain all elements from `lst` that have the minimum difference (`mini`) when subtracted from `pk`, as each element in `lst` was checked exactly once during the loop iterations.
