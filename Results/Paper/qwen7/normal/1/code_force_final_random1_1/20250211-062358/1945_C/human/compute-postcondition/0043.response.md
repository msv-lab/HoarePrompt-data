Postcondition: **`zero` is either 2 or 1; `one` is either 0 or 2 or 1 or 3; `zero_perc` is 200 or 100; `one_perc` is recalculated as ((`zero` - `one`) * 100) // (`n` - (`i` + 2) - 1); `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 or 2 more than its previous value; `lst` is a list containing three elements all equal to `i + 1`; `one` is decreased by `one`, and `one_perc` is recalculated as ((`zero` - `one`) * 100) // (`n` - (`i` + 2) - 1).**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` is true, then `lst` is updated to contain three elements all equal to `i + 1`. If the condition is false, the variables remain unchanged according to the else part (which in this case does not specify any changes, so the state remains as per the if part).
