Output State: **`i` is 2, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is -66.67, `lst` is `[3]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` equals 3. Therefore, `lst` now contains the element 3. The values of `i`, `zero`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged.
