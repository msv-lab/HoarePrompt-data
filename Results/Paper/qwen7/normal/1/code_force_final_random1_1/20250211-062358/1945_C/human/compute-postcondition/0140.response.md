Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`.
   - `final` is a list containing the element `elem` from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`.
   - `lst` must contain at least one element.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for elem in lst:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `elem` in `lst`.
   - The loop body (which is omitted) presumably updates `mini` and `final` based on the current `elem`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `lst`, the variable `elem` changes with each iteration.
   - The variable `mini` might change if a new smaller value is found.
   - The variable `final` might change to include the new element that matches the updated `mini`.

5. **State at the Start of Next Iteration:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `elem` will be the next element in `lst`.
   - `mini` and `final` will be updated based on the previous iteration's values.

Given that `lst` must contain at least one element, and assuming the loop is about to start its next iteration, we need to consider the next element in `lst`.

Since the exact values of `mini` and `final` depend on the loop body, we cannot specify their exact values without knowing the loop body. However, we can say that `mini` will be updated to the smallest value among `abs(pk - elem)` for the remaining elements in `lst`, and `final` will be updated accordingly.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `mini` will be the smallest value among `abs(pk - elem)` for the remaining elements in `lst`.
- `final` will be the list containing the element `elem` from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for the remaining elements in `lst`, and `final` is a list containing the element `elem` from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`.**
