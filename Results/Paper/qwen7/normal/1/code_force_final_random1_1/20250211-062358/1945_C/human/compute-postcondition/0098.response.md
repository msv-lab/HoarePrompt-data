Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `zero_perc` as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1, `i + 1` will be either 1 or 2. The value of `zero` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise. Therefore, `zero_perc` will be `zero * 100 // 1` if `i` is 0, which simplifies to `zero * 100`, or `zero * 100 // 2` if `i` is 1. The initial conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
