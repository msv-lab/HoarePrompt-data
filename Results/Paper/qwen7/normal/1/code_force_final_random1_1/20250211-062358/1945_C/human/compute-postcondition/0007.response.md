Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an odd integer, `pk` is `n / 2`, `s` is a string input by the user**

The code assigns `n / 2` to the variable `pk`. Since `n` is an odd integer, dividing it by 2 results in a floating-point number that is not an integer. The conditions for `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
