Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `zero` is either 2 or 1, `one` is either 2 or 3, `zero_perc` is 66.67, `one_perc` is 0, and `lst` is [2]**.

Explanation: The variable `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Given that `zero` is either 2 or 1 and `i` is 3, we substitute these values into the equation. If `zero` is 2, then `zero_perc` is `2 * 100 // (3 + 1) = 50`. If `zero` is 1, then `zero_perc` is `1 * 100 // (3 + 1) = 25`. However, since the problem specifies that `zero` is either 2 or 1, and without additional context to choose between 25 and 50, we can only provide the more likely scenario where `zero` is 2, resulting in `zero_perc` being 66.67 (rounded to one decimal place). The other variables remain unchanged.
