Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1, `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 0**

Explanation: The code calculates `zero_perc` as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Given the initial state, `zero` is 1, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0. Since `s[i]` equals '0', `zero` is 1. The calculation for `zero_perc` is `1 * 100 // (1 + 1)`, which simplifies to `100 // 2`, resulting in `50`. However, since integer division truncates the decimal part, `zero_perc` is `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.
