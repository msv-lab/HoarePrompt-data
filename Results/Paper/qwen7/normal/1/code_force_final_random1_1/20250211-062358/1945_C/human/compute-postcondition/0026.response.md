Output State: **`zero` is either 1 or 0; `one` is either 0 or 1; `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s`; `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is an index within the string `s`, `i + 1` is a new integer value that is added to the list. The other variables (`zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
