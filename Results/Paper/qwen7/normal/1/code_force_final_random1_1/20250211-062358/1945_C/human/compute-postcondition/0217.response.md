Output State: **`pk` is an integer, `elem` is an integer (next element in `lst`), `mini` is an integer, `final` is a list containing the element `elem`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `final` initially contained the element `elem`, after appending `elem` again, `final` will now contain a list with `elem` as its only element. The values of `pk`, `elem`, and `mini` remain unchanged.
