### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly initializes `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - It reads `n` and the binary string `s` for each test case.

2. **Calculation of Halfway Point:**
   - `pk` is calculated as `n / 2` (integer division), which is used to find the midpoint index.

3. **Counting Zeros and Ones:**
   - `zero` and `one` count the number of zeros and ones in the string `s`.

4. **Iterating Through the String:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` to calculate the percentage of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the current position `i`.
   - It checks if both percentages are at least 50% and appends the position `i + 1` to `lst` if they are.

5. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - The program finds the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any position in `lst`.
   - It then selects the smallest position from `lst` that has the minimum absolute difference with `pk`.

6. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If no position in `lst` meets the criteria, the program calculates the percentage of '1's in the entire string `s`.
   - If the percentage of '1's is 50% or more, it sets the optimal position to 0.
   - Otherwise, it sets the optimal position to `n`.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the optimal position for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the optimal position `i` is correct.
- The handling of edge cases (when no valid `i` is found) is also correct.
- The overall structure and flow of the program match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
