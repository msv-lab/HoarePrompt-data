Output State: **`mini` is 100000000, `final` is either `[0]` or `[n]` depending on whether `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50, and `t` is `t - 1`; `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `mini = pow(10, 8)` sets `mini` to the value 100000000. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
