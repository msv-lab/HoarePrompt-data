Postcondition: ***`zero` is either 1 or 0; `one` is either 0 or 2; `zero_perc` is either 50 or 100; `one_perc` is calculated as ((o - one) * 100) // (n - i - 1); `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value; `lst` is a list containing two elements both equal to `i + 1`. This condition holds if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. If the condition is not met, the variables retain their original values.***
