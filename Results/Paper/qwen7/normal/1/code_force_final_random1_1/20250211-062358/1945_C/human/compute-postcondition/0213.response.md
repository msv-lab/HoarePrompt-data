Output State: **`pk` is an integer, `elem` is an integer, `mini` is an integer, the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, and `final` now contains the element `elem`.**

Explanation: The line `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since no other changes were made to the variables `pk`, `elem`, or `mini`, their values remain unchanged. The only new information is that `final` now includes the value of `elem`.
