Based on the initial state provided:

- `mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`.
- `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum value of `mini` when subtracted from `pk`.
- `final` is sorted.
- If `len(final)` is 0, then either `final` includes 0 if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or `final` contains an additional element `n` and `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.

The `print(final[0])` statement will print the first element of the list `final`.

To determine what `final[0]` is, we need to consider the conditions under which `final` is populated and sorted. Since the exact values of `lst`, `pk`, `o`, `n`, and `c1` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `final[0]`. However, we know that `final` is a list of elements from `lst` that have the minimum difference with `pk`, and it is sorted.

Therefore, the output will be the first element of the sorted list `final` that meets the criteria described.

Output: **final[0] (where final is a sorted list of elements from lst that have the minimum value of mini when subtracted from pk)**
