Output State: **`zero` is 2, `one` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value, `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2. The values of `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `s`, `i`, and `lst` remain unchanged from their initial states.
