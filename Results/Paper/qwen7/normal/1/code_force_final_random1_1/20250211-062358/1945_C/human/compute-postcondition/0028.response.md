Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i` and `n`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an index within `s`.
   - The loop condition is `i < n - 1`, meaning the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Adjust the state of `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state of `n`**:
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration because it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Ensure the loop condition is satisfied**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `zero` is either 1 or 0 (unchanged).
- `one` is either 0 or 1 (unchanged).
- `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 (unchanged).
- `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 (unchanged).
- `s` is a string (unchanged).
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1` (unchanged).

Since `i` is incremented by 1, if `i` was previously `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the new state should reflect this change in `i` while keeping other variables unchanged.

**State: **`zero` is either 1 or 0; `one` is either 0 or 1; `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value; `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1`**.
