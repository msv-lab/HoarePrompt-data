Output State: **`pk` is an integer, `mini` is an integer, `final` is a list containing `[n]`, `c1` is less than 50.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Initially, `final` is an empty list. After executing `final.append(n)`, `final` becomes a list containing `[n]`. The other variables (`pk`, `mini`, and `c1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
