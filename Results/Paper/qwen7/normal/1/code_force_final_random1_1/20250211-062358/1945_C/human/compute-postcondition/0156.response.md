Based on the initial state provided:

- `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`.
- `final` is either `[0]` or `[n]` depending on whether `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50.

The `print(final[0])` statement will print the first element of the list `final`.

To determine the value of `final[0]`, we need to consider the condition for `final`:
- If `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` is `[0]`.
- If `c1` is less than 50, then `final` is `[n]`.

Since the value of `c1` is not explicitly given, we can only describe it in terms of the condition. However, regardless of the value of `c1`, `final` will always be either `[0]` or `[n]`.

Therefore, `final[0]` will be either `0` or `n`.

Output: **0 or n (depending on whether c1 is >= 50 or < 50)**
