Output State: **`mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `lst` is a list with at least 3 elements (since it lost its first element), and `final` now contains the third element of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code appends the third element of `lst` to the list `final`. The values of `mini` and `lst` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `lst` now has one less element because its first element was lost. The variable `elem` refers to the third element of `lst`, which is now added to `final`.
