Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1, `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 0, `lst` is [2]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `i + 1` equals 2. This value is appended to `lst`, making `lst` equal to `[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
