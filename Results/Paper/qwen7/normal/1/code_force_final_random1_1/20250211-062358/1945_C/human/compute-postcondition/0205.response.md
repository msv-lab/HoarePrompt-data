Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**.

This means that the list `lst` still contains at least one element, and the variable `mini` has been updated to the smallest value found between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element `ele` in the list `lst`.
