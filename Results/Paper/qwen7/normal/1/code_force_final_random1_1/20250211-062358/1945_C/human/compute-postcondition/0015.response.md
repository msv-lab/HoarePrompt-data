Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `pk` is `n / 2`, `s` is a string input by the user, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000**.

Explanation: The line `mini = pow(10, 8)` assigns the value `100000000` (which is \(10^8\)) to the variable `mini`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the initial conditions for the other variables remain unchanged, and `mini` is now set to `100000000`.
