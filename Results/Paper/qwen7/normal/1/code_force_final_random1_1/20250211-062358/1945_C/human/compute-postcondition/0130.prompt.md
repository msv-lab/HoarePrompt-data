Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The final state of the loop will be as follows: `i` equals `n-2`, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n-1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n-2) - 1)` which simplifies to `(o - one) * 100 // 1` or simply `o - one` since `n - (n-2) - 1` equals 1, and `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where the condition `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` was met during the loop iterations.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in `lst` and `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
