Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `ele` which iterates over the list `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop updates the variable `mini` to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

3. **Determine the state changes**: At the end of the previous iteration, `mini` is updated based on the current value of `ele`. For the next iteration, `ele` will be the next element in the list `lst`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `mini` is updated based on `ele`, and `ele` will be the next element in the list, we need to ensure that `mini` is correctly updated for the next element. However, the exact value of `mini` after the update is not specified, so we can only say that it will be the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - next_element)`.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The only variables that change within the loop head are `ele` and `mini`. Since `ele` will be the next element in the list, and `mini` will be updated based on this new `ele`, we need to reflect this in the state.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - next_element)`, where `next_element` is the next element in the list `lst`**. 

However, since we cannot specify the exact value of `mini` without knowing the next element, the most accurate representation of the state is:

State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - next_element)`, where `next_element` is the next element in the list `lst`**.
