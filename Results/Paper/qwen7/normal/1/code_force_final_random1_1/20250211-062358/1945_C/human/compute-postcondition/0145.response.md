Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`, and `final` is a list of sorted elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. The value of `mini` remains unchanged as it was determined before sorting. The list `final` now contains all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, but these elements are sorted.
