Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. The condition checks if `s[i]` is '0'. Since `i` is 0, `s[0]` is checked. If `s[0]` is '0', then `zero` is set to 1. After setting `zero` to 1, `i` is incremented to 1. The calculation for `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, which becomes `1 * 100 // 2 = 50 // 1 = 50`. However, since integer division in Python truncates the decimal part, `zero_perc` is 0.
