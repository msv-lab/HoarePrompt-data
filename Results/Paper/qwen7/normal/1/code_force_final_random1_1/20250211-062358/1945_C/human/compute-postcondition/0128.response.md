Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `ele` from the `lst`. There are no other variables directly involved in the loop condition.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.
   - `ele` is the next element in `lst`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `ele` is the next element in `lst`, after the previous iteration, `ele` would have been set to the next element in the list.
   - `mini` remains unchanged because it is updated based on the current value of `ele` during each iteration, but its value is not directly affected by the loop itself.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `mini` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `ele` is now the next element in the list `lst`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in `lst`**.
