Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 2)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 2)`, and the current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The code `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since the value of `i` is either 0 or 1, `i + 1` will be either 1 or 2. However, the specific value of `i` does not affect the postconditions related to `zero`, `zero_perc`, `one`, `one_perc`, `n`, and `o`. The only change is that `i` is incremented by 1 when calculating `zero_perc` and `one_perc`. Thus, the denominator in the calculation of `zero_perc` changes from `(i + 1)` to `(i + 2)`, and similarly, the denominator in the calculation of `one_perc` changes from `(n - i - 1)` to `(n - i - 2)`.
