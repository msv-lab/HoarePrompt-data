Output State: **`mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. `lst` is a list with at least 4 elements. `elem` is the first element of `lst`. The current value of `mini` is equal to `abs(pk - elem)`, and `final` is a list with its first element as `elem`.**

Explanation: The code appends the first element of the list `lst` (denoted as `elem`) to the list `final`. Since `mini` was defined based on the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, and `elem` is the first element of `lst`, the value of `mini` remains unchanged. The list `final` now includes `elem` as its first element.
