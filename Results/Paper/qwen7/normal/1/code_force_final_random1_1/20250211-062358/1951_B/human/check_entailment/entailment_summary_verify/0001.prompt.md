You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))

        if ind[0] > k:
            return ind[0] - 1
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
    if ind[0] == 0:
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
    if k > ind[1]:
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a sorted list of integers `a` and finds a specific index based on certain conditions. It returns a value derived from the index `k` and the positions of the first two elements in the list `ind` that satisfy particular criteria. The function can return `n - 1`, `k - 1`, a value 1 less than the first element of `ind`, 13, the minimum value between the second element of `ind` minus 1 and `k - 1`, the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, or the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of matches a cow at position `k` can win.
   - We can swap the cow at position `k` with another cow once to optimize its performance.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cows) and `k` (index of the cow).
   - It then reads the ratings of the cows and calls the function `func_1` with these ratings.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes a list of ratings `a`.
   - It extracts the rating of the cow at position `k` and stores it in `x`.
   - It initializes an empty list `ind` to store indices where the rating is greater than `x`.
   - It iterates through the ratings and adds indices to `ind` if the rating is greater than `x`. It stops after finding the first two such indices.
   - If `k` is 14, it prints the indices (for debugging purposes).
   - Depending on the length of `ind`, it returns different values:
     - If no such indices are found, it returns `n - 1` (the cow can potentially win all remaining matches).
     - If only one such index is found, it calculates the maximum possible wins based on the position of this index relative to `k`.
     - If two such indices are found, it calculates the maximum possible wins based on the positions of these indices relative to `k`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic seems to handle the basic cases correctly:
     - If no cow has a higher rating, the cow can theoretically win all remaining matches.
     - If only one cow has a higher rating, the cow can win up to the position of this cow minus one.
     - If two cows have higher ratings, the cow can win up to the minimum of the positions of these cows minus one or the position of the cow minus the first cow with a higher rating.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases like when `k` is 14 and prints indices (though this is not part of the final output).
   - The logic should work for any valid input within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k`. Given the problem constraints and the example provided, the code seems to handle all scenarios appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
