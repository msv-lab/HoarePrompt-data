Output State: **`j` is increased by 2, `h` is greater than or equal to `i`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `j` was already increased by 1, so now `j` is increased by 2. The condition that `h` is greater than or equal to `i` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their original states.
