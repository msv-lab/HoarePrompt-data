Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split.**

The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
