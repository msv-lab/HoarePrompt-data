Output State: **`s` is a list of integers with the first and the k-1th elements swapped, `i` is the last element of the new list `s`, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` plus one if the first element was not `h`, `z` is 1 if the last element of the new list `s` is equal to `h`, otherwise `z` remains 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `h` is the first element of the list `s`, `ans` is 0, `j` is -1.**

The variable `j` is assigned the value `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
