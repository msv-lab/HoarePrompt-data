Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `ind` is a list containing 1**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1, but since `c` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed that `c` is a different variable from `i`. Therefore, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables (`n` and `ind`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
