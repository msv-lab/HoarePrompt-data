Output State: **`s` is a list of integers from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `s`. The variable `k` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `k` is still an integer from the input split, and `s` is now a list containing those integers.
