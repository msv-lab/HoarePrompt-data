Output State: **`i` is the second element of the list `s` + 1, and `s` is the list without its first element (if it originally had more than one element)**.

Explanation: The code `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. However, since `ans1` was not defined before, it is assumed to be 0 initially. After the increment, `ans1` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
