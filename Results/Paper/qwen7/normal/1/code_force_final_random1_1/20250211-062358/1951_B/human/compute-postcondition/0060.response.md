Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `s` to iterate over. After each iteration, `i` takes the value of the current element from the list `s`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is the first element of the list `s`.
   - `s` is a non-empty list.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` has already taken the value of the first element of `s`, the next element in the list `s` will be the new value of `i` in the next iteration.
   - The list `s` will lose its first element after the current iteration.

5. **Postconditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be the second element of the list `s` (if `s` had more than one element).
   - `s` will be the list without its first element (if it originally had more than one element).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values of `i` and `s`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the second element of the list `s`, and `s` is the list without its first element (if it originally had more than one element)**.
