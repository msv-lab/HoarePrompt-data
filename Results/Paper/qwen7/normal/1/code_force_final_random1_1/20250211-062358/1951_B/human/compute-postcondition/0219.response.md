Output State: **`ans1` is 1, `i` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is less than or equal to `h`, `z` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. Initially, `ans1` is not specified, but since no initial value is given, we assume it starts at 0. After executing the code, `ans1` becomes 1. The conditions for `i` and `z` remain unchanged.
