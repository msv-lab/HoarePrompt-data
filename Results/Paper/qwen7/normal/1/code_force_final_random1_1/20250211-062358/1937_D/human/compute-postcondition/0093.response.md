Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to '>', `l` is greater than `r` by at least 1, `r` is not equal to 0, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `b` is expressed in terms of the original values and the subtraction operation.
