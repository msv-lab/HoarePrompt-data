Output State: **`B` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is a non-empty list, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` and the current value of `s[i]` is '<'**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `x` using the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. Since `B` is an empty list, `len(B) - 1` is `-1`, and `B[-1]` is `0`. Given `j` is `0`, `i` is `n - 1 - 0`, which is `n - 1`. Assuming `idx_B` is a non-empty list, let's denote its last element as `k`. Therefore, `x` is calculated as `0 + (k - (n - 1)) * len(idx_B)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
