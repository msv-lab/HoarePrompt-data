Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1]` if `r` is not 0, otherwise `b` remains unchanged if `r` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `b = A[l - 1]` assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to `b`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `a`) are not affected by this line of code. The precondition that `r` is decreased by 1 and `b` is updated to `A[l - 1]` if `r` is not 0, otherwise `b` remains unchanged if `r` is 0, is still valid after the code has been executed.
