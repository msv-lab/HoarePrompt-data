Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r` is 0, otherwise `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1), `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` to `B[r - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states. Specifically, if `r` is 0, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, otherwise it is updated to `B[r - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. The value of `x` remains `r - (l + 2)`.
