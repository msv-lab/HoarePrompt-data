Output State: **`x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, `A` now contains one additional element which is `x`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', and the length of `idx_A` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `A.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, but `A` now includes this new value. All other conditions and values of the other variables remain the same as the initial state.
