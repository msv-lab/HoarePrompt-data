Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, meaning the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The character `s[i]` is equal to '>'.
   - The length of `idx_A` is now 2 more than before.
   - `x` is updated to either the new value of `i` and `idx_A` or the value of `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
   - `A` has either one or two additional elements appended to it.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `n` (the next value after `n-1`).
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change within the loop body based on the information provided.

5. **Construct the New State**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`**.
