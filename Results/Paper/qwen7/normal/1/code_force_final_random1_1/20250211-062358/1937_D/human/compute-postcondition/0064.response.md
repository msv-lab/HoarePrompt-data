Output State: `B` is a list where each element is updated according to the rules defined within the loop. Specifically, for each iteration, if `s[i]` is '<', `B` appends a new value which is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. If `s[i]` is not '<', `B` simply appends 0. `idx_B` contains all the indices of characters '<' in the string `s` as the loop iterates through the string from the end to the beginning. `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, and `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.

In summary, `B` will contain a series of values based on the positions of '<' characters in `s` and their relative positions, while `idx_B` will list all the indices of these '<' characters.
