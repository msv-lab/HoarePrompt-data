Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the character `s[i]` is equal to '>', the length of `idx_A` is now 4 more than before, `x` is updated to the value of `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` based on the last element of list `A`, the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A`, and the length of `idx_A`. The length of `idx_A` increases by 2 according to the initial state, and the code does not affect `n` or `s[i]`. Therefore, the length of `idx_A` is now 4 more than its original length. The value of `x` is calculated as specified, and the other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
