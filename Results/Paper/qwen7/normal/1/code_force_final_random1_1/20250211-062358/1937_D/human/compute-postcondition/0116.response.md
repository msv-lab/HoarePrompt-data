Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, and the current value of `l` is greater than 0; `b` is equal to the value of `B[r - l] - B[r - l]`, which is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated to `b - B[r - l]`. Given that `b` was originally equal to `B[r - l]`, subtracting `B[r - l]` from `b` results in `b` being 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
