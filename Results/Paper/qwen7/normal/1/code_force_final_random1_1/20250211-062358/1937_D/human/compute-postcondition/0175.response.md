Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is equal to `r - 1`, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is equal to `B[r] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1) - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its previous value. Given the initial conditions, the updated value of `b` is calculated as specified. All other variables remain unchanged.
