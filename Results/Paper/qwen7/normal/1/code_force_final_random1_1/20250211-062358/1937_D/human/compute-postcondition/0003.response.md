Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter and is initialized to 0.
   - The variable `n` represents the length of the string `s`.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 0, so the condition `i < n` will hold true if `n` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 so that the loop can start executing.
   - The initial value of `i` is already set to 0, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

5. **Final State**:
   - The state of `s` and `A` and `idx_A` do not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than 0.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
