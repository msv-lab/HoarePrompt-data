Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. However, upon closer inspection, the logic in the `func_1` function does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of directions as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement Time**: The function tries to calculate the time based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters but does not properly account for the pinball's movement and direction changes. The calculation of `A` and `B` lists seems to be an attempt to capture the cumulative distance but is not implemented correctly.

2. **Misinterpretation of Direction Changes**: The pinball's direction should be inverted after each move, but the code does not reflect this behavior accurately. Instead, it seems to be trying to compute some kind of cumulative distance without considering the actual movement pattern.

3. **Logic Flaws in Output Calculation**: The logic used to compute the final output values (`a` and `b`) is flawed and does not match the expected behavior of the pinball's movement. The calculations do not take into account the alternating direction changes and the exact positions where the pinball would leave the grid.

Given these issues, the provided implementation does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and thus cannot produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
