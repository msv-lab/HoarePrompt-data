Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - `r` is decreased by 1.
   - Depending on the value of `r`, `b` is either unchanged if `r` is 0, or `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
   - If `r` is not 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
   ```

Given these details, let's analyze the expression inside the `print` function:

- `n - i`: Since `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0, this part simplifies to `n - 1`.
- `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`: Here, `i` is 1, so this part simplifies to `(1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

To determine the exact value of `idx_A[l - 1]`, we need more information about the `idx_A` list. However, since no specific values for `idx_A` are provided, we can only express it in terms of `idx_A[l - 1]`.

Combining these parts, the expression becomes:
\[ n - 1 + 2 \cdot (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) \]

Simplifying further:
\[ n - 1 + 2 - 2 \cdot idx_A[l - 1] = n + 1 - 2 \cdot idx_A[l - 1] \]

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **n + 1 - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]**
