Output: **n - 0, end=' ' (which simplifies to n, end=' ')**

Explanation:
- `i` is 0 as given in the initial state.
- `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified.
- The character at index `i` of string `s` is '>', which is consistent with `i` being 0.
- `l` and `r` are mentioned, but their values do not affect the print statement directly. The only relevant information is that `r` is currently 0.

The print statement `print(n - i, end=' ')` will print the value of `n - i`, where `i` is 0. Therefore, it will print `n - 0`, which simplifies to just `n`. The `end=' '` parameter ensures that a space is printed after the value, but this does not change the value being printed.
