Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and depending on the value of `r`, `b` is updated as follows: if `r` is 0, `b` remains unchanged; if `r` is not 0, `b` is updated to `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1) - (idx_B[r - 1] - idx_B[r - (l + 2)]) + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r - (idx_B[r - (l + 2)] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - (l + 2) + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r` is not 0, or `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `r` is 0. Additionally, `a` is updated to `A[l]` if `l < r`, and to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` if `r` is not 0. The value of `x` is `r - (l + 2)` if `l < r`, and remains as `r` if `l >= r`. If `s[i] == '>', `l` is increased by 1, otherwise `r` is decreased by 1.**
