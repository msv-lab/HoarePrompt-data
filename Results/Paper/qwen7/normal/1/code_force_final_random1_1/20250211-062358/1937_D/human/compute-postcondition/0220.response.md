Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (l - 1)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` to `a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. Given that `i` is 2, `a` is initially the value of `A[l - 1]`, and `idx_A[l - 1]` is a specific index value, the new value of `a` becomes `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (l - 1)`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
