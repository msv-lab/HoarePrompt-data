Output State: **`B` is a list where if `len(idx_B)` is 0, then `B` is [0]; otherwise, the last element of `B` is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - 1)) * len(idx_B)`, `B` now contains `[0]`, `idx_B` is `[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`, the current value of `s[i]` is '<'**.

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value `0` to the list `B`. Since `B` was initially defined such that if `len(idx_B)` is 0, then `B` is `[0]`, and otherwise, the last element of `B` is updated based on certain conditions involving `idx_B`, appending `0` to `B` does not change its initial condition because `B` already starts as `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
