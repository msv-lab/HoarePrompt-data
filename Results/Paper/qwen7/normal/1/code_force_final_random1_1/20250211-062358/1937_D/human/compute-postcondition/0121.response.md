Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `r` is decreased by 1, so let's assume `r` was initially some value, but now it is one less than that value
- The current value of `l` is greater than 0
- `b` is equal to the value of `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`

We need to determine the values of the variables involved in the `print` statement:
- `a` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.
- `b` is defined as `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `b + idx_B[r] * l`.
- `i` is 0.
- The `end=' '` in the `print` statement means that the output will be followed by a space.

Since `a` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe the expression that will be evaluated.

Output: **a * 2 + (b + idx_B[r] * l) * 2 + 1**
