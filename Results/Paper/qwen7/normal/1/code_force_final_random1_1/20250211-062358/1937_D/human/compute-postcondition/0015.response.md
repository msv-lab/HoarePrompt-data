Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the character `s[i]` is equal to '>', the length of `idx_A` is now 2 more than before, `A` has an additional element 0 appended to it, and `x` is updated based on the new values of `i` and `idx_A`.**

Explanation: The code `A.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `A`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, the character `s[i]`, the length of `idx_A`, or the expression for `x`. Therefore, these conditions remain as they were in the initial state, with the addition that `A` now contains an extra element `0`.
