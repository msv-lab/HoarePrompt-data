Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (l - 1), `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its current value. Given that `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l)` from `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
