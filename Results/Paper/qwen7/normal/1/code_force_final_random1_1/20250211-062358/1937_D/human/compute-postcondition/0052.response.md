Output State: **`B` is a list with its last element updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - 1)) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is `[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '<'.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to `idx_B`. Since `i` is `n - 3`, `idx_B` now contains `[i]`. The value of `B` is updated based on the condition that `len(idx_B)` is not 0. Given that `len(idx_B)` is 1, the last element of `B` is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - 1)) * len(idx_B)`, which simplifies to `B[0] + (i - (n - 2)) * 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
