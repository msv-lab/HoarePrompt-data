Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `r` is decreased by 1 (though the exact value of `r` is not given, it is derived from some context not provided here).
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - `a` is the value of `B[r]`.
   - `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

2. **Code to Analyze:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

Given the initial state:
- `i` is explicitly given as 0.
- `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified.
- `r` is derived from some context but is not explicitly given.
- `a` is the value of `B[r]`, where `B` is a list and `r` is an index into this list.
- `b` is computed as `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `b + (-idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1) = b - idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)`.

Since `i` is 0, the expression `(n - i)` simplifies to `n`.

Putting it all together:
- `a * 2` is `2 * B[r]`.
- `b * 2` is `2 * (b - idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1))`.
- `(n - i)` is simply `n`.

So, the expression to be printed is:
\[ 2 \cdot B[r] + 2 \cdot (b - idx_A[l - 1] \cdot (r + 1)) + n \]

Given the format required, the output should be described as follows:

Output: **2 * B[r] + 2 * (b - idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)) + n**
