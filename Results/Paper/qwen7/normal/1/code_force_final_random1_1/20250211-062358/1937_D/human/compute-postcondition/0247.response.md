Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and returns a sequence of integers. For each character in `s`, it calculates and prints a value based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters up to that point. Specifically, it computes the cumulative sum of distances from the nearest '>' character to all '<' characters (and vice versa) and uses these sums to determine the output value. The function processes the string from both ends, updating indices and sums accordingly, and outputs the calculated values for each character in `s`.**
