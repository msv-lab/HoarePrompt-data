Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1]` if `r` is not 0, otherwise `b` remains unchanged if `r` is 0, `b` is decreased by `A[l - r - 2]` and further decreased by `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`.
