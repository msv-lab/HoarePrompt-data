Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to '>', `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the value of `b` is updated to `A[l - 1]`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
