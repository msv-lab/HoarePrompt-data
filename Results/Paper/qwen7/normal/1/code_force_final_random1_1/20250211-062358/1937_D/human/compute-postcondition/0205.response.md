Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is unchanged if `r` is 0, otherwise `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and `l` is increased by 1 if `s[i] == '>'` or `r` is decreased by 1 otherwise.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `i` remains 2, `n` must still be greater than 0, `l` is still greater than or equal to `r`, and the update rules for `b` and the changes to `l` or `r` depend on the value of `s[i]`.
