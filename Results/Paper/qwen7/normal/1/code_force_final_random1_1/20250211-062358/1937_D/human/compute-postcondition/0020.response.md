Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, the character `s[i]` is equal to '>', the length of `idx_A` is now 2 more than before, `x` is updated to either the new value of `i` and `idx_A` or the value of `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and `A` has either one or two additional elements appended to it.
