Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is either 0 or decreased by 1, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, and `b` is updated as follows: if `l` is 0, `b` remains unchanged; if `l` is greater than 0, `b` is equal to the value of `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`; if `r` is not 0, `b` is also updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
