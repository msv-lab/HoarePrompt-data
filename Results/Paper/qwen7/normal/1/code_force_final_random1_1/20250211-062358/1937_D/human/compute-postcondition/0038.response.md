Output State: **`B` is now [0], `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '<', and the length of `idx_B` is 0**

Explanation: The code `B.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `B`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
