Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (l - 1), `b` is the value of `B[r]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `B[r]` to `b`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `r` is decreased by 1 is still valid, and `a` retains its calculated value.
