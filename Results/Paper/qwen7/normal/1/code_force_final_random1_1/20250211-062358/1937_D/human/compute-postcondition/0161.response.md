Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `b` is updated to either `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` if `l - r > 0`, or remains `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` if `l - r <= 0`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is now adjusted according to the condition, and `b` is `A[l - 1]` if `l - r <= 0`.
