Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and depending on the value of `r`, `b` is either unchanged if `r` is 0, or `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` is not 0, `a` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `r` is not 0 and `l - r - 1 > 0`, `b` is further updated to `b - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`. If `s[i] == '>'`, `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1. If `r` is 0, `b` remains unchanged. If `r` is not 0, `a` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` if `l - r > 0`, or remains as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r <= 0`.**
