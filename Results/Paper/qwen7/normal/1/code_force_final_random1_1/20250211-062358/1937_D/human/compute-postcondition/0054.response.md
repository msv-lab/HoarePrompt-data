Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(0, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `B` is a list where its last element is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`.
   - `idx_B` is `[i]`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors.
   - `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - The current value of `s[i]` is '<'.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, it remains unchanged.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `j` is updated to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0.

6. **Final state**:
   - `B` remains unchanged.
   - `idx_B` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `A` remains unchanged.
   - `idx_A` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - The current value of `s[i]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `j` and `n`.

**State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than 0**
