Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, and the current value of `l` is greater than 0; `b` is 0 - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)**

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by subtracting the product of `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` and `(r - l)` from its current value, which is 0. Since `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `- (idx_B[r - l] - 0) * (r - l)`, or `- (idx_B[r - l]) * (r - l)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
