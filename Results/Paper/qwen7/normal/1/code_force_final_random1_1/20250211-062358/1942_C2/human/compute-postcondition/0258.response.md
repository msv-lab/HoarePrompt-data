Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `t1` is `(a[3] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`**

Explanation: The code updates `t2` to `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Given that `i` is 3, `t2` becomes `(a[3] + 2) % n`. The other variables (`x`, `i`, `t1`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value for `t2`.
