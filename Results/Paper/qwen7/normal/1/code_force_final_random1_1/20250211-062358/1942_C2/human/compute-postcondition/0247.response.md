Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n` and is not in set `st`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n` and is in set `st`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The values of `t1` and `t2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state includes `ans` being increased by 1, while `t1` and `t2` retain their original conditions.
