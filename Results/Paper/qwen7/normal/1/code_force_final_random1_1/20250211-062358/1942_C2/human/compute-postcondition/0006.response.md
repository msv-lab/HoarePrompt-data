Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input, `a` is a list of three integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `tmp`. The values of `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
