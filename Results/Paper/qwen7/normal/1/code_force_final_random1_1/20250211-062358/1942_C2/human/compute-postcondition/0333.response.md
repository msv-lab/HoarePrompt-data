Output State: **`even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0 and must be non-empty, y is an integer less than gap // 2, ans is increased by 2 * y.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by `2 * y`. Since `y` is an integer less than `gap // 2`, `2 * y` is a specific value. The values of `even` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
