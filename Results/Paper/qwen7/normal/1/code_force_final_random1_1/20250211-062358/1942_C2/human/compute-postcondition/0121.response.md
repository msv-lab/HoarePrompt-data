Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers where the difference between the first two elements is not equal to 2, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, and the current value of `y` is greater than 0; `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`; `ans` is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is decreased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1.
