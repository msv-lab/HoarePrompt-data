Postcondition: **`tt` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `ii` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the second integer input minus the sum of ((`a[i]` - `a[i - 1]`) // 2 - 1) for each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` where their difference is even, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the sum of (`a[i]` - `a[i - 1]) // 2 for each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` where their difference is even, `tmp` is a list containing the values (`a[i]` - `a[i - 1]) // 2 for each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` where their difference is even, `i` is the length of the list `a`, and the last difference `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not considered in the conditions of the loop. `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2**
