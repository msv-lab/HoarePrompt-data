Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `ii` is len(a) + 1, `n` is the integer input from the first split, `x` is the integer input from the second split, `y` is the integer input from the third split minus the sum of ((`a[i]` - `a[i - 1]`) // 2 - 1) for each valid pair of consecutive elements, `a` is now a sorted list of integers, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list, `i` is the length of the list `a`, `ans` is increased by 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2. Otherwise, if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than (`a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - 1` and `tmp` includes the value (`a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2, otherwise, `y` remains unchanged and `tmp` does not change, `ans` is increased by `y`, `n` is the integer input from the first split, `x` is the integer input from the second split, `y` is the integer input from the third split.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, and `ans` is an integer. If the difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element of `a` is exactly 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference is not 2, then `ans` remains unchanged. Additionally, if the difference is even and greater than 2, `tmp` is a list containing one element, which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged and `ans` remains unchanged. All other elements in the list `a` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is an integer, `tmp` is a list. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, `tmp` has an additional element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` appended to it, and `y` is reduced by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. If neither condition is met, the values of `ans` and `y` remain unchanged, and `tmp` remains the same list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `k + 2`, `ans` is an integer, `tmp` is a list. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, `tmp` is appended with `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, and `y` is updated to `y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1`. If neither condition is met, the values of `ans` and `y` remain unchanged, and `tmp` remains a list with its original elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
