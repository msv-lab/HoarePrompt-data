Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`**.

This means that the value of `i` remains `x - 1`, `x` stays within its initial range, and `next_elem` is calculated based on the condition given. If `i` equals `x - 1`, then `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`; otherwise, `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`.
