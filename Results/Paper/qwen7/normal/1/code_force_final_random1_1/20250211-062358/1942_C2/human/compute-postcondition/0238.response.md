Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated input, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
