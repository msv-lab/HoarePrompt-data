Output State: **`tt` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `tt = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `tt`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` (which is equivalent to `tt`) is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the same condition applies to `tt` after the code is executed. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
