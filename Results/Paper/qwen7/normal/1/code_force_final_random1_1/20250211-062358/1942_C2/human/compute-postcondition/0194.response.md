Postcondition: `odd` is a sorted list of all `gap` values that are greater than 1 and odd, with the first element removed; `ans` is incremented by the value of `next_gap + 2 * y`. If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0 and `ans` is further incremented by the value of `next_gap + 2 * y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
