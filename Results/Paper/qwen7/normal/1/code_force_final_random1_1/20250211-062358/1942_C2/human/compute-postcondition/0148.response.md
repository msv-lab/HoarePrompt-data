Postcondition: `i` equals `len(a)`, `a` retains its original list of integers, `ans` is the sum of all increments made during the loop, `tmp` is a list containing all valid elements added during the loop based on the conditions, `y` is the final value after all decrements have been applied, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.
