Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and mapping them to integers. However, `t` is now assigned the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        if c == 1:
            sx += 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    cons = min(n - 2, cons)
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `x` is at least 3, `c` is 0, `sx` is 3, `y` is -4, `cons` is 2
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is the last element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is `y - sum(i // 2 for i in val)`, `sx` is increased by the sum of all elements in `val` plus `y - (sum(i // 2 for i in val)) * 2`, `cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`, `i` is the last element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is decreased by the sum of all `c` values, `sx` is the sum of all `i` values plus the initial value of `sx`, and `val` and `l` remain sorted as per the given conditions.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
