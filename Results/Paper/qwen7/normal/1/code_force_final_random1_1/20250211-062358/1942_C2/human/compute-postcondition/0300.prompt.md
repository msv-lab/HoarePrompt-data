Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `odd` is an empty list, `x` is less than or equal to its initial value, `i` is equal to the final value of `x`, `even` is an empty list, `t1` is `(a[i-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i-1] + 2) % n`, and `ans` remains at 1 if the condition `t1 not in st and t2 in st` was met for any iteration, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
        odd.append(gap)
    elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
        even.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `x - 1`, `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value, `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and if `gap > 1` and `gap % 2 == 1`, then `odd` contains the value `gap`; otherwise, if `gap > 0` and `gap % 2 == 0`, then `even` is `[gap]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `x`, `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and `odd` is a list containing one element which is `gap` if `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd. Otherwise, `even` is a list containing one element which is `gap` if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even. If `gap` does not meet these conditions, `even` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `x`, `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value, `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `odd` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `gap` if `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd, otherwise `even` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `gap` and the second element is the original element from `even` if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even, otherwise `even` remains unchanged if `gap` does not meet these conditions; if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even, `even` is appended with `gap`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
