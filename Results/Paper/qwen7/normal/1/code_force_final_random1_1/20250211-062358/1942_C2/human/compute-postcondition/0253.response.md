Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `ans` is 1, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, changing its value from its initial state (unchanged, meaning it was previously 0) to 1. All other variables (`x`, `i`, `t1`, and `t2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
