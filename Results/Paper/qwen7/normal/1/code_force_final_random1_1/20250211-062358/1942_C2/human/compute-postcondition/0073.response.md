Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is `ans + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list with an additional element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` appended to it.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged as `k + 1`. The variable `ans` is updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to its current value. The variable `tmp` is a list that now includes an additional element, which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
