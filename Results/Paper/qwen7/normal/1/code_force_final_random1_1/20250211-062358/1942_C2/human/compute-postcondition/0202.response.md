Postcondition: **`odd` is a sorted list of all `gap` values that are greater than 1 and odd, with the first element removed, minus one element; `y` is `-next_gap // 2 - first_odd // 2`; `ans` is incremented by the value of `first_odd + 2 * y`. If `y < gap // 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
