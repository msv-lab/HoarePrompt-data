Postcondition: **`i` equals `len(a)`, `a` retains its original list of integers, `ans` is the sum of all increments made during the loop, `tmp` is a list containing all valid elements added during the loop based on the conditions, `y` is the final value after all decrements have been applied, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2**
