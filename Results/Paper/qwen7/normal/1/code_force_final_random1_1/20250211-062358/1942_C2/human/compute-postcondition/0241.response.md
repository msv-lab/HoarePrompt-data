Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each element is (num - 1) for each num in the original list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `ans` is `x - 2`, `st` is a set containing elements from list `a`**.

Explanation: The line `st = set(a)` creates a set `st` from the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers where each element is `(num - 1)` for each `num` in the original list `a`, the set `st` will contain the same elements as `a`, but without any duplicates. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
