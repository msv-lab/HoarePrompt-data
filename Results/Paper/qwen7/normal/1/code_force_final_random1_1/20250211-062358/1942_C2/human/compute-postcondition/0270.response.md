Output State: **`odd` contains the value `gap`, `i` is `x - 1`, `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value, `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Since the initial value of `gap` is greater than 1 and is an odd number, `odd` now contains this specific value of `gap`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
