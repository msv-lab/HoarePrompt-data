Output State: **`i` is `len(a)`, `ans` is an integer equal to the original `ans` value plus 1, `tmp` is a list, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` remains `len(a)`, `ans` becomes the original value of `ans` plus 1, `tmp` remains a list, and the condition `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2 is still valid.
