Postcondition: `i` is `len(a)`, `ans` is an integer, and `tmp` is a list. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is equal to the original `ans` value plus 1, and `tmp` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to be an integer plus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` is updated to contain one element which is `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is greater than `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`.
