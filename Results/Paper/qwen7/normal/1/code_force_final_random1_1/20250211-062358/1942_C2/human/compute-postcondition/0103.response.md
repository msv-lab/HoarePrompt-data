Output State: **`i` is `len(a)`, `ans` is an integer plus `y`, and `tmp` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans += y` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `y`. Since the initial condition specifies that `ans` is an integer and the value of `ans` changes only if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, which is not directly affected by this line of code, the only change is that `ans` is now `ans + y`. The variables `i`, `tmp`, and `y` remain as per their initial conditions.
