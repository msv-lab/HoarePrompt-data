Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates and outputs a specific value `cons` for each test case based on the given conditions. The final value of `cons` is determined as `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`, where `sx` is the sum of certain differences derived from the input integers.**
