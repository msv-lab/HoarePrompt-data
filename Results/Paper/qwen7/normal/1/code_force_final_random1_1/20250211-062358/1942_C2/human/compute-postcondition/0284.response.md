Output State: **`i` is `x`, `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `odd` is a list containing one element which is `gap`.**

Explanation: The line `odd.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Since `gap` is defined as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and no other operations are performed on `gap`, the only change is that `gap` is added to the list `odd`. All other variables retain their previous values.
