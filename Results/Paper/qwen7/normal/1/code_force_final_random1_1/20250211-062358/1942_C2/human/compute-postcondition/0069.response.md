Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, and `ans` is an integer. If the difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element of `a` is exactly 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference is not 2, then `ans` remains unchanged. Additionally, if the difference is even and greater than 2, `tmp` is a list containing one element, which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged and `ans` remains unchanged. All other elements in the list `a` retain their original values.
