Postcondition: `i` is `x`, `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value, `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `odd` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `gap` if `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd, otherwise `even` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `gap` and the second element is the original element from `even` if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even, otherwise `even` remains unchanged if `gap` does not meet these conditions; if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even, `even` is appended with `gap`.
