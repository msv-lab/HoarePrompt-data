Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2, `v` is an integer from the input, `end` equals `v`.**

Explanation: The code `end = v` assigns the value of `v` to `end`. Since `v` is an integer from the input and its current value is not specified beyond being an integer, it remains as `v`. All other variables (`i`, `t`) retain their previous values.
