Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `start` is equal to `v`, and `end` is equal to `v`.**

Explanation: The line `start = v` assigns the value of `v` to the variable `start`. Since `v` is the second integer from the input, `start` now holds the same value as `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
