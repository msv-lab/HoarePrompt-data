isOne is a boolean value indicating whether to return the number of test cases (t) as 1 if True, otherwise return the actual number of test cases as read from the input. t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each test case consists of n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) constraints, where each constraint is represented by two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), indicating the type of constraint and the value x respectively. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
