Output State: **`num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list), and the condition `i < start or i > end` is true.**

The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state and the code snippet only contains a single line without any loop context, the variables `num` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition `i < start or i > end` also remains true as no changes were made to `i`, `start`, or `end`.
