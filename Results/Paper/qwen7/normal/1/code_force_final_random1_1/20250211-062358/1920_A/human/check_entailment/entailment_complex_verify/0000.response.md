### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the annotated code and the logic of the `func_7` function to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function `func_7` Analysis:**
   - The function reads `n` constraints and initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1000000000.0.
   - For each constraint, it updates `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint:
     - If `t == 1`, it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
     - If `t == 2`, it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
     - If `t == 3`, it appends `v` to the list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, it counts the number of elements in `num` that do not fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - If `start > end`, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it returns the number of valid integers minus the count of invalid integers in `num`.

2. **Handling Type 3 Constraints:**
   - The function correctly identifies and stores all values from type 3 constraints in the list `num`.
   - When counting the valid integers, it excludes the values in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - This ensures that the values in `num` are excluded from the count of valid integers, thus correctly handling the "not equal to" constraints.

3. **Correctness of the Function:**
   - The function correctly identifies the range `[start, end]` based on the constraints.
   - It correctly counts the number of integers that fall within this range.
   - It correctly excludes the values from `num` that fall within this range.
   - The final count is adjusted by subtracting the count of invalid integers in `num`.

Given the detailed analysis, the function `func_7` correctly handles all constraints, including the "not equal to" constraints. Therefore, the original assessment that the program does not correctly handle the constraints is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided constraints.
