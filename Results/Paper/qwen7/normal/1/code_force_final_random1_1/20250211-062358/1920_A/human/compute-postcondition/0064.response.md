Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num` is an empty list.
   - `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list).
   - The condition `i < start or i > end` is checked.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in `num`.
   - The loop condition is based on the value of `i`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - Since `num` is currently an empty list, there are no elements to iterate over.
   - Therefore, the loop body is not executed in this iteration.

4. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `num` is still an empty list, the loop will not execute because there are no elements to iterate over.
   - The only variable that needs adjustment is `num`, but since it remains an empty list, no change is needed.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - No changes are needed for the state because the loop will not execute again due to the empty list.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list)**
