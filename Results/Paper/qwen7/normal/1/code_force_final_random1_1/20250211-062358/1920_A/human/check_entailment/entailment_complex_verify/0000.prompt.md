You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each test case, there are exactly n lines describing constraints. Each constraint is represented by two integers a and x where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.

    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is True, it returns an integer input provided by the user, constrained to the range 1 to 500 for the variable 't' and 2 to 100 for the variable 'n'. If `isOne` is False, it returns the integer 1. After the function concludes, the program will have either an integer input from the user or the integer 1, depending on the value of `isOne`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of constraints for each test case, and each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is either 1, 2, or 3 indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `space` (a boolean) and `to_int` (an integer). If `to_int` is set to a non-zero value, it converts each item in a list to an integer and returns the list of integers.

    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `string` will be a concatenation of all the string representations of the integers in `arr`, separated by the separator `sym`.

    #The program returns a string that is constructed by taking each integer in the list `arr`, converting it to a string, and then appending it to `string` with a separator `sym` in between. The final string ends with the string representation of the last element of `arr` concatenated with `sym`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym` as inputs. It constructs and returns a single string where each integer from the list is converted to a string, concatenated with the separator `sym`, and the entire sequence ends with the string representation of the last integer followed by `sym`.

    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `indices` will contain every starting position in `string` where `substring` was found, in the order they were found.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `string` (a string consisting of printable ASCII characters) and `substring` (a string consisting of printable ASCII characters with a length less than or equal to the length of `string`). It returns a list containing all the starting positions in `string` where `substring` was found, in the order they were found, and an integer representing the position of the last occurrence of `substring` in `string`, or -1 if `substring` is not found.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each inner list has at least one element; index is an integer such that 0 <= index < len(inner list), and value is any value that can be compared with the element at the specified index in the inner lists.

    #State: Output State: The function returns the last list in the list of lists `arr` if `subArray[index]` equals `value` for any of the lists. If `subArray[index]` does not equal `value` for any of the lists, the function returns `None`.
    #
    #This output state describes the final condition of the program after all iterations of the loop have been executed. The loop iterates over each sublist (`subArray`) in `arr`, checking if the element at the specified index matches the given value. As soon as it finds a match, it returns the matching sublist. If no match is found after checking all sublists, it returns `None`.
    return None
    #The program returns None because there was no sublist in `arr` where the element at the specified index matched the given value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` searches through a list of lists (`arr`) to find a sublist where the element at a specified index matches a given value (`value`). If such a sublist is found, it returns that sublist; otherwise, it returns `None`. Specifically, the function can return the first, second, or third sublist in `arr` if their respective elements at the specified index match the given value. If no match is found, it returns `None`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of integer inputs, categorizing them into three types: minimum values (type 1), maximum values (type 2), and a list of values (type 3). It then counts how many of these listed values fall outside the range defined by the minimum and maximum values. If the minimum value is greater than the maximum value, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values adjusted by the count of out-of-range values.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints. Specifically, it does not properly account for the constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to some integer x). The current implementation only checks if the values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`, but it does not exclude the specific values listed in `num` from the count. This leads to incorrect results in cases where there are constraints of type 3.

For example, consider the following input:
- Number of constraints \( n = 4 \)
- Constraints: 
  1. \( k \geq 3 \)
  2. \( k \leq 10 \)
  3. \( k \neq 1 \)
  4. \( k \neq 5 \)

The correct answer should be 7 (the integers 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), but the program will incorrectly count 1 and 5 as valid, leading to an incorrect result.
