Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 (the starting value of the range function).
   - The variable `n` must be a positive integer because the `range(n)` function requires `n` to be a non-negative integer.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\) and updated to the integer input value.
- `t` is an integer in the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\).
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\).
- `start` is -1.
- `end` is 1000000000.0.
- `num` is an empty list.

We need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the states of `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Variable `i`**: 
   - The loop will start with `i = 0`, as `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`.
   
2. **Variable `n`**:
   - Since `n` must be a positive integer and the loop requires `n` to be at least 1, we need to ensure `n` is within the valid range \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).

### Final Adjusted States:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` requires `n` to be at least 1, and given the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), we can safely say `n` must be at least 1).

Thus, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**
