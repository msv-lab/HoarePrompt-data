Output State: **`num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list)**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there was no modification to any variable's value and the loop condition or structure hasn't been altered, the values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.
