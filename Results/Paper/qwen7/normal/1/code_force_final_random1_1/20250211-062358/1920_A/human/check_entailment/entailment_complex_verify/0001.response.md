### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy a set of constraints. These constraints include:
   - \( k \) must be greater than or equal to some integer \( x \).
   - \( k \) must be less than or equal to some integer \( x \).
   - \( k \) must be not equal to some integer \( x \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`) that are not directly used in the main logic of solving the problem. However, `func_7` is the primary function that processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers \( k \).

3. **Analyzing `func_7`**:
   - It reads the number of constraints \( n \).
   - It initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0`.
   - It iterates over the constraints, updating `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint:
     - For `t == 1`, it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
     - For `t == 2`, it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
     - For `t == 3`, it adds `v` to the list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, it counts how many elements in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns `0` (indicating no valid \( k \)).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid \( k \) values as `end - start + 1 - count_num`.

4. **Checking Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_7` correctly identifies the range `[start, end]` where \( k \) can lie.
   - It correctly handles the exclusion of specific values using the list `num`.
   - The final calculation of the number of valid \( k \) values is correct.

However, there is a critical issue with the implementation of `func_7`:
- The initialization of `start` to `-1` is problematic because it can lead to incorrect results if the first constraint is of type 2 (i.e., \( k \leq x \)). In such cases, `start` should be initialized to the minimum value of \( x \) from the constraints of type 1.
- The logic for handling constraints of type 3 (i.e., \( k \neq x \)) is also problematic. The current implementation simply appends all values to `num`, but it should filter out values that are already excluded by the constraints of type 1 and 2.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumed that the code was correct without addressing these issues. The initialization of `start` and the handling of constraints of type 3 need to be corrected.

**Final: False**
