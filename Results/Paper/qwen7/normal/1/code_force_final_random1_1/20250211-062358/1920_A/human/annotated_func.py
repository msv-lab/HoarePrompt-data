#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each test case, there are exactly n lines describing constraints. Each constraint is represented by two integers a and x where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.

    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is True, it returns an integer input provided by the user, constrained to the range 1 to 500 for the variable 't' and 2 to 100 for the variable 'n'. If `isOne` is False, it returns the integer 1. After the function concludes, the program will have either an integer input from the user or the integer 1, depending on the value of `isOne`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of constraints for each test case, and each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is either 1, 2, or 3 indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.

        #`The program returns a list of either strings obtained by splitting the string input 'line' on spaces or all characters of the string 'line' depending on whether 'space' is True or False`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `space` (a boolean) and `to_int` (an integer). If `to_int` is set to a non-zero value, it converts each item in a list to an integer and returns the list of integers. If `space` is `True`, it splits a string `line` on spaces and returns the list of substrings. If `space` is `False`, it returns a list of all characters in the string `line`.

    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `string` will be a concatenation of all the string representations of the integers in `arr`, separated by the separator `sym`.

    #The program returns a string that is constructed by taking each integer in the list `arr`, converting it to a string, and then appending it to `string` with a separator `sym` in between. The final string ends with the string representation of the last element of `arr` concatenated with `sym`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym` as inputs. It constructs and returns a single string where each integer from the list is converted to a string, concatenated with the separator `sym`, and the entire sequence ends with the string representation of the last integer followed by `sym`.

    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `indices` will contain every starting position in `string` where `substring` was found, in the order they were found. The variable `index` will hold the position of the last occurrence of `substring` in `string`, or -1 if `substring` is no longer found in `string`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `string` (a string consisting of printable ASCII characters) and `substring` (a string consisting of printable ASCII characters with a length less than or equal to the length of `string`). It returns a list containing all the starting positions in `string` where `substring` was found, in the order they were found, and an integer representing the position of the last occurrence of `substring` in `string`, or -1 if `substring` is not found.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `element`. It searches through the list `arr` and returns a list of indices where the integer `element` is found. If `element` is not found in `arr`, an empty list is returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each inner list has at least one element; index is an integer such that 0 <= index < len(inner list), and value is any value that can be compared with the element at the specified index in the inner lists.

    #State: Output State: The function returns the last list in the list of lists `arr` if `subArray[index]` equals `value` for any of the lists. If `subArray[index]` does not equal `value` for any of the lists, the function returns `None`.
    #
    #This output state describes the final condition of the program after all iterations of the loop have been executed. The loop iterates over each sublist (`subArray`) in `arr`, checking if the element at the specified index matches the given value. As soon as it finds a match, it returns the matching sublist. If no match is found after checking all sublists, it returns `None`.
    return None
    #The program returns None because there was no sublist in `arr` where the element at the specified index matched the given value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` searches through a list of lists (`arr`) to find a sublist where the element at a specified index matches a given value (`value`). If such a sublist is found, it returns that sublist; otherwise, it returns `None`. Specifically, the function can return the first, second, or third sublist in `arr` if their respective elements at the specified index match the given value. If no match is found, it returns `None`.

    #
    #In more detail, the loop will have iterated `n` times, with each iteration processing one line of input. The variable `i` will count up to `n-1`. The variables `t` and `v` will hold the values from the current line of input. If `t` is 1, `start` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `v`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of integer inputs, categorizing them into three types: minimum values (type 1), maximum values (type 2), and a list of values (type 3). It then counts how many of these listed values fall outside the range defined by the minimum and maximum values. If the minimum value is greater than the maximum value, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values adjusted by the count of out-of-range values.
