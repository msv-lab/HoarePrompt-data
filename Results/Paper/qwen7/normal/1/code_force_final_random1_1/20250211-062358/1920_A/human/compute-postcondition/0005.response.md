Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer from the input, `v` is an integer from the input**

Explanation: The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part into integers, and assigns them to `t` and `v` respectively. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. Therefore, `i` is still 0, and `t` and `v` are the integers obtained from the input.
