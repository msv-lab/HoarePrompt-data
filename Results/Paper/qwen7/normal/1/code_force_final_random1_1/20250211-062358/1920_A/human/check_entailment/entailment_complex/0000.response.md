Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is used to initialize the number of test cases (`t`) and the number of constraints per test case (`n`). However, the function's implementation seems redundant and unnecessary. Given the problem statement, we expect `t` and `n` to be directly read from input, but the function `func_1` is designed to handle a boolean flag `isOne` which is not utilized. The function should simply read `t` and `n` directly from input without any conditional logic.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads a line of input and processes it based on the `space` and `to_int` parameters. However, the function is not necessary for reading the constraints since the problem specifies that the constraints are read directly from input. This function could be simplified to just read the constraints directly.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function converts a list of integers to a string with a specified separator. While this function is correctly implemented, it is not used in the main program.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function finds all occurrences of a substring in a string. It is not used in the main program and can be removed.

5. **Function `func_5`**: This function finds the indices of a specific element in a list. It is not used in the main program and can be removed.

6. **Function `func_6`**: This function searches for a sublist in a list of lists based on a specific index and value. It is not used in the main program and can be removed.

7. **Function `func_7`**: This function correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It initializes `start` and `end` based on the constraints of type 1 and 2, and collects values of type 3 in the list `num`. It then counts how many values in `num` fall outside the range `[start, end]` and adjusts the result accordingly. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the primary issue is with the unnecessary and redundant functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`). These functions do not contribute to solving the problem and make the code unnecessarily complex. However, the core logic in `func_7` is correct.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the presence of unnecessary and redundant functions that do not contribute to solving the problem. The main logic in `func_7` is correct, but the overall structure of the program is overly complex and inefficient.
