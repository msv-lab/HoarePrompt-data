Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `t` will be the last integer from the input, `v` will be the last integer from the input, `num` will be a list containing all integers `v` from each iteration where `t` was 3, `start` will be the minimum value of all `v` where `t` was 1, and `end` will be the maximum value of all `v` where `t` was 2. `count_num` will be 0.**

This means that after the loop completes, the following conditions hold true:
- The variable `i` will be set to `n-1`.
- The variable `t` will hold the value of the last integer entered during the loop.
- The variable `v` will hold the value of the last integer entered during the loop.
- The list `num` will contain all integers `v` where `t` was 3.
- The variable `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` was 1.
- The variable `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` was 2.
- The variable `count_num` will be initialized to 0.
