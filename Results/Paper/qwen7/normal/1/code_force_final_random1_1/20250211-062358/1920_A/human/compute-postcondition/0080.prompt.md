You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and for each constraint, t is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all constraints are unique.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `t` will be the last integer from the input, `v` will be the last integer from the input, `num` will be a list containing all integers `v` from each iteration where `t` was 3, `start` will be the minimum value of all `v` where `t` was 1, and `end` will be the maximum value of all `v` where `t` was 2.
    #
    #In more detail, the loop will have iterated `n` times, with each iteration processing one line of input. The variable `i` will count up to `n-1`. The variables `t` and `v` will hold the values from the current line of input. If `t` is 1, `start` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `v`. If `t` is 2, `end` will be updated to the maximum value between its current value and `v`. If `t` is 3, `v` will be appended to the list `num`.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `num` will be an empty list, `i` will be the first element of `num` (which is still an empty list), `count_num` will be the total number of elements in `num` that satisfy the condition `i < start or i > end`.
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `num` will be an empty list, `i` will be the first element of `num` (which is still an empty list), `count_num` will be the total number of elements in `num` that satisfy the condition `i < start or i > end`. The condition `start > end` is false.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: 0


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
