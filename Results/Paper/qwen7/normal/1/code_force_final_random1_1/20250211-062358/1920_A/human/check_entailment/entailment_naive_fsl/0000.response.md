Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints. Specifically, it does not properly account for the constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to some integer x). The current implementation only checks if the values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`, but it does not exclude the specific values listed in `num` from the count. This leads to incorrect results in cases where there are constraints of type 3.

For example, consider the following input:
- Number of constraints \( n = 4 \)
- Constraints: 
  1. \( k \geq 3 \)
  2. \( k \leq 10 \)
  3. \( k \neq 1 \)
  4. \( k \neq 5 \)

The correct answer should be 7 (the integers 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), but the program will incorrectly count 1 and 5 as valid, leading to an incorrect result.
