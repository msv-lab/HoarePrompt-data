Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `start` is equal to `v`, and `end` is equal to `v`.**

The code `end = v` simply assigns the value of `v` to the variable `end`. Since `v` is already defined as the second integer from the input, `end` now holds the same value as `v`. All other variables (`i`, `t`, `num`, `start`) remain unchanged.
