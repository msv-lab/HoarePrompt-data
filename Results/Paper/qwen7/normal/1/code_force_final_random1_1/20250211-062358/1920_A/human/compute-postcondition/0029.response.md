Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input separated by a space. These integers are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)` and then unpacked into `t` and `v`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged, and `num` is updated to contain the value of `v` as a list.
