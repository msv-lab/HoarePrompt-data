Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `word` is either 'az' if `n` is greater than 52, or 'aaa' if `n` is less than or equal to 52

We need to determine what will be printed when the `print(word)` statement is executed.

Since the value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot definitively determine the exact value of `word`. However, we can describe the possible outcomes based on the conditions given:

- If `n` is greater than 52, then `word` will be 'az'.
- If `n` is less than or equal to 52, then `word` will be 'aaa'.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `n`.

Output: **'az' if n > 52, otherwise 'aaa'**
