Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts (since `range(int(input()))` generates numbers starting from 0).

3. **Determine the Initial Value of `int(input())`**: The value of `int(input())` is determined by the user input. However, based on the constraints given, the value of `int(input())` must be within the range 1 to 100 (inclusive).

4. **Constraints on the Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1. Since `t` is constrained to be between 1 and 100, we can assume that the user will provide a valid input within this range.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the initial state of `i` is set to 0 and the value of `int(input())` is within the valid range.

**State after adjustment**:
- `i` should be set to 0.
- The value of `int(input())` must be within the range 1 to 100.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be between 1 and 100**
