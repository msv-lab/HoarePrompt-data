Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 26, `word` is 'az'**.

Explanation: The code appends 'a', the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 28`, and 'z' to the `word` string. Since `n` is an integer greater than 26, `n - 28` will be an integer between -2 and -1 (inclusive). Assuming `alphabet` is a standard English alphabet list starting from 'a', `alphabet[n - 28]` would be either 'y' or 'z'. Given the sequence, it appends 'a', 'y', and 'z' to `word`. However, since the exact character at `n - 28` is not specified, we consider the general case where it is 'y', resulting in `word` being 'ayz'. But due to the typical behavior of such operations, it more likely results in 'az' considering the direct addition without specifying the intermediate character. Thus, `word` becomes 'az'. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
