Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- If `n` is greater than 52, then `word` is 'zz'.
- If `n` is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52, then `word` is 'az'.
- If `n` is less than or equal to 26, then `word` is 'aaa'.

We need to determine the value of `word` based on the value of `n`.

Since the value of `n` is not explicitly given in the initial state, we need to consider the different cases:

1. If `n > 52`, then `word` = 'zz'.
2. If `26 < n ≤ 52`, then `word` = 'az'.
3. If `n ≤ 26`, then `word` = 'aaa'.

Without knowing the specific value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact value of `word`. Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `n`.

Output: **'zz', 'az', or 'aaa' depending on the value of n**
