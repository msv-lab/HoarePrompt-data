Output State: **`i` is 1, `array2` contains the value `arr[0] * a`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `arr[0] * a` to the list `array2`. Since `i` is initially set to 1 and the condition `i` must be less than `n` is satisfied (assuming `n` is greater than 1), the value of `i` does not change. The list `array2` now contains the appended value.
