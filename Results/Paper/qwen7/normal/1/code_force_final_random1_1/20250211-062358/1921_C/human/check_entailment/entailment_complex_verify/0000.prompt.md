You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `test_cases`, which is the total number of test cases. The variable `n` will be the value of `feat[0]` for the last test case, and it must be an integer within the range `1` to `10^4`. The variable `f` will be the value of `feat[1]` for the last test case, `a` will be the value of `feat[2]` for the last test case, and `b` will be the value of `feat[-1]` for the last test case. `arr` will be a list of integers obtained from the input for the last test case, split by spaces and converted to integers. `array2` will be a list containing elements where each element is `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` for every `j` in the range from `3` to `n-1` inclusive, provided that `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a`. The final output will be 'Yes' if the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f` for the last test case; otherwise, the output will be 'No'.
    #
    #This means that after processing all the test cases, the loop will have iterated through all the inputs, and the final decision ('Yes' or 'No') will be based on the conditions evaluated for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( f \), \( a \), and \( b \), along with a list of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it calculates whether the sum of certain adjusted differences between consecutive elements in the list, plus a linear term, is less than \( f \). If true for the last test case, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the phone's charge might drop to zero due to continuous usage without turning it off. Specifically, the program calculates the total charge consumed based on the intervals between messages and the cost of turning the phone off and on, but it does not account for the continuous usage charge within those intervals.

Consider the following test case:
```
3 10 1 2
1 2 3
```
- At moment 0, the phone has 10 units of charge.
- Between moments 1 and 2, the phone uses 1 unit of charge.
- Between moments 2 and 3, the phone uses another unit of charge.
- Total charge used for continuous usage is \(1 + 1 = 2\) units.
- The phone also incurs the cost of turning off and on, which is 2 units.

The total charge consumed is \(2 + 2 = 4\) units, which is less than 10, so the phone should be able to send all messages. However, the program incorrectly prints "No" because it does not properly account for the continuous usage charge within the intervals.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the charge consumed during each interval and ensure the total does not exceed the initial charge `f`. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[-1]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        total_charge_used = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            interval_charge = (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a
            if interval_charge > b:
                total_charge_used += b
            else:
                total_charge_used += interval_charge
        
        # Add the cost of turning off and on for each interval except the last one
        total_charge_used += (n - 1) * b
        
        if total_charge_used <= f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This corrected version ensures that the total charge consumed is accurately calculated, including both the continuous usage and the cost of turning the phone off and on.
