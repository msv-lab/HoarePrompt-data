You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `test_cases`, which is the total number of test cases. The variable `n` will be the value of `feat[0]` for the last test case, and it must be an integer within the range `1` to `10^4`. The variable `f` will be the value of `feat[1]` for the last test case, `a` will be the value of `feat[2]` for the last test case, and `b` will be the value of `feat[-1]` for the last test case. `arr` will be a list of integers obtained from the input for the last test case, split by spaces and converted to integers. `array2` will be a list containing elements where each element is `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` for every `j` in the range from `3` to `n-1` inclusive, provided that `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a`. The final output will be 'Yes' if the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f` for the last test case; otherwise, the output will be 'No'.
    #
    #This means that after processing all the test cases, the loop will have iterated through all the inputs, and the final decision ('Yes' or 'No') will be based on the conditions evaluated for the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading the necessary parameters (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`) and the list of message times (`arr`).

2. **Calculating Energy Consumption:**
   - The program calculates the energy consumed by sending messages directly (without turning off) and the energy consumed by turning off and on the phone.
   - For each pair of consecutive message times, it checks if the time difference is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`. If it is, it means it would be more efficient to turn off and on the phone rather than just sending the message directly.
   - It appends the energy cost of turning off and on to `array2`.

3. **Summing Up Total Energy Cost:**
   - The program sums up the total energy cost of turning off and on the phone and adds the energy cost of sending the remaining messages directly.
   - It then compares this total energy cost with the initial charge `f`.

4. **Outputting Result:**
   - If the total energy cost is less than or equal to `f`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Analysis:

- The logic for determining whether it's more efficient to turn off and on the phone is correct.
- The summation of energy costs and comparison with the initial charge is also correct.
- However, there is a potential issue with the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. This condition assumes that the energy cost of turning off and on is always greater than the direct energy cost of sending a message, which might not be true if `b` is very large compared to `a`.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 1`, `f = 3`, `a = 1`, `b = 5`
  - `arr = [3]`
  - Directly sending the message at `m_1 = 3` consumes `3 * 1 = 3` units of charge, which matches `f`. The program outputs "NO" because it incorrectly assumes turning off and on would consume more than `3` units.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 5`, `f = 10`, `a = 1`, `b = 2`
  - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - The program correctly calculates the energy cost and determines that it is possible to send all messages, outputting "YES".

- **Test Case 6:**
  - `n = 3`, `f = 11`, `a = 9`, `b = 6`
  - `arr = [6, 8, 10]`
  - The program correctly calculates the energy cost and determines that it is possible to send all messages, outputting "YES".

### Conclusion:

The program has a logical flaw in the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, which can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
