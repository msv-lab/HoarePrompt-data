Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `test_cases` must be greater than `n + 1`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of the list `feat` to the variable `b`. Since `feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, the value of `b` is the last integer in the list. The values of `i`, `n`, `test_cases`, `f`, and `a` remain unchanged.
