Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than or equal to the maximum index present in `arr` (which is `len(arr) - 1`), `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is a list containing elements where each element is `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` for every `j` in the range from `3` to `n-1` inclusive, provided that `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning it has gone through all the indices starting from 3 up to `n-1`. The variable `n` must be at least as large as the last index of `arr`. The other variables (`f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `array2`) retain their initial conditions, with `array2` now containing all the valid `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` values for every `j` from 3 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` holds true.
