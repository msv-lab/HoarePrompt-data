Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `array2` contains elements based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, if `arr[0] < b / a`, then `arr[0] * a` will be in `array2`. For each subsequent index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, if `arr[i] - arr[i-1] < b / a`, then `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a` will be appended to `array2`. If neither condition is met for any index, the corresponding value will not be added to `array2`. The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.**
