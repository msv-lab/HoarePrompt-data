Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than `3`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is a list containing elements where each element is `(arr[j+1] - arr[j]) * a` for all `j` such that `3 <= j < n` and `arr[j+1] - arr[j] < b / a`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `array2`) remain unchanged except for `array2`, which now contains a series of calculated values based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` for each iteration of the loop.
