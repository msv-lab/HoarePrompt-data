Output State: **`i` is 0; `arr[0]` is less than the value of `b` divided by `a`; `array2` contains the value of `arr[0] * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `arr[0] * a` to the list `array2`. Since `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, the value appended to `array2` is `arr[0] * a`. The values of `i` and the condition about `arr[0]` remain unchanged.
