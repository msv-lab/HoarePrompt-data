Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`, and `array2` contains elements where each element is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a` for every `i` in the range from `1` to `n-1`. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is not less than `b / a`, those values do not get appended to `array2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n + 1`, `n` will be an integer within the specified range, and `array2` will contain all the values that meet the condition `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a` for each iteration of `i` from `1` to `n-1`. If any `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` does not meet the condition, it will not be included in `array2`.
