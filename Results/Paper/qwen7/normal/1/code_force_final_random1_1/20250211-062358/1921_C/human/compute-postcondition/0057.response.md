Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`, and `array2` contains elements that satisfy the condition `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. Additionally, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.
