Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`, and `array2` contains one additional element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is not less than `b / a`, `array2` remains unchanged.
