Postcondition: `i` is an integer. If `i` is 0, then `arr[0]` is less than the value of `b` divided by `a`, and `array2` contains the value of `arr[0] * a`. If `i` is not 0, then either `array2` remains unchanged, or if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, `array2` has an additional element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.
