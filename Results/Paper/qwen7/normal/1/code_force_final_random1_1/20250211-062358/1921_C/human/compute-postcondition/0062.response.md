Output State: **`i` is 3, `test_cases` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `feat` by taking input from the user and splitting it into individual integers. Since the initial value of `i` is 3 and the condition that `test_cases` must be at least 3 is not directly affected by the code, `i` remains unchanged. The value of `test_cases` is now a list of integers entered by the user, which is represented by `feat`.
