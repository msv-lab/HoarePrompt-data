Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 3, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is `feat[0]` must be greater than 3, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is a list containing one element which is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`, and the current value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` remains 3, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `array2` are as described in the respective conditions. If the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is true, then `array2` contains `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`. If the condition is false, `array2` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 4, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 3, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a` and the second element is `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 5, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 3. If `arr[5] - arr[4] < b / a`, then `array2` contains an element equal to `(arr[5] - arr[4]) * a`. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur in other cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
