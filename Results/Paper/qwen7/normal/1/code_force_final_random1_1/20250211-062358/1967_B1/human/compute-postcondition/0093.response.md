Output State: **`total` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is at least 4, `countmins` is `count - 1`, `g` is `int(n / count) - countmins`, `ans` is `n + int(g / count) + 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `g` is decremented by `countmins`. Since `countmins` is defined as `count - 1`, `g` becomes `int(n / count) - (count - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
