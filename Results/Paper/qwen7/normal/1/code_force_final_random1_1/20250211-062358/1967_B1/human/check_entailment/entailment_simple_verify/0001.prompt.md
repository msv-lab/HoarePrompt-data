You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())

        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:

            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: `count` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer provided by the user, `m` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `countmins` is equal to `m`, `g` is 0, and `ans` is the initial value of `n` plus the sum of the contributions from each iteration of the loop for all `i` from 0 to `t - 1`.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the following will be true:
    #- `count` will be `m + 1` because the loop increments `count` until it exceeds `m`.
    #- `i` will be `t - 1` because the loop iterates `t` times, and `i` is the loop counter.
    #- `n` will remain the input integer provided by the user.
    #- `m` will remain the input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4.
    #- `countmins` will be `m` because it is initialized as `count - 1` and `count` becomes `m + 1` at the end of the loop.
    #- `g` will be 0 because the loop breaks when `g` becomes less than `countmins`.
    #- `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of the series where each term is `int(int(n / i) / i) + 1` for `i` ranging from 2 to `m`, inclusive, for all iterations of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to 2.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`. This suggests that the program might be counting pairs where `b = 1`, which is always valid since `a + 1` is always a multiple of `1`.

3. **Loop to Calculate Valid Pairs:**
   - The loop runs from `count = 2` to `count <= m`.
   - For each `count`, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - It then calculates `g` as `n // count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks. This condition seems unnecessary and might not cover all cases correctly.
   - Otherwise, it updates `g` to `g - countmins`.
   - It then adds `int(g / count) + 1` to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed.

### Detailed Check

Let's check if the logic correctly counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

#### Example Test Cases

1. **Test Case (1, 1):**
   - Only `(1, 1)` satisfies the condition.
   - The program prints `1`, which is correct.

2. **Test Case (2, 3):**
   - Valid pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`.
   - The program prints `3`, which is correct.

3. **Test Case (3, 5):**
   - Valid pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, `(3, 1)`.
   - The program prints `4`, which is correct.

4. **Test Case (10, 8):**
   - Valid pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, `(3, 1)`, `(4, 1)`, `(5, 1)`, `(6, 1)`, `(6, 2)`, `(6, 3)`, `(7, 1)`, `(8, 1)`, `(9, 1)`, `(10, 1)`, `(10, 2)`, `(10, 3)`.
   - The program prints `14`, which is correct.

5. **Test Case (100, 1233):**
   - The program prints `153`, which matches the expected output.

6. **Test Case (1000000, 1145141):**
   - The program prints `1643498`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the example test cases, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.
