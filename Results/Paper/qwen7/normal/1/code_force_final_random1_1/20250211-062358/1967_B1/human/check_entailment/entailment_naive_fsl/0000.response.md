Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to count valid pairs (a, b) based on a simplified approach that does not fully adhere to the conditions specified in the problem description.

To illustrate, consider the test case \( n = 10 \) and \( m = 8 \):

- According to the problem, we need to count pairs (a, b) such that \( 1 \le a \le n \), \( 1 \le b \le m \), and \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this condition. For instance, the pair (2, 2) should satisfy the condition because \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) and \( 2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \). But the program incorrectly counts such pairs.

The program uses a loop to incrementally check values of `count` and calculates `g` as `int(n / count)`, which does not accurately reflect the necessary conditions for the pairs. This approach fails to properly account for the gcd and the multiple condition, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
