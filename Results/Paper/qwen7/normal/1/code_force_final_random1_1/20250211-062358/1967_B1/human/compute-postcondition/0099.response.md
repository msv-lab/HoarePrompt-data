Output State: **`total` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is at least 4, `count` is 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program exits the current loop or conditional block. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
