Output State: **`count` is `m + 1`, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer from the first input, `m` is the input integer from the second input, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`, `ans` is `n + the sum of [int(int(n / i) / i) + 1 for i in range(2, m + 1)]`**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The other variables (`count`, `i`, `countmins`, `g`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
