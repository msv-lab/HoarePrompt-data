Output State: **`total` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an integer such that `m` is at least 4, `countmins` is `count - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`, `ans` is `n`**.

Explanation: The line `countmins = int(count - 1)` updates the variable `countmins` to be the integer value of `count - 1`. However, the initial state does not specify what `count` is, so we cannot determine the exact value of `countmins` without knowing `count`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
