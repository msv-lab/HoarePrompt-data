Output State: **`count` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 4, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 2`, `ans` is `int((int(n / 2) - 2) / 2) + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or modified within the given code snippet, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
