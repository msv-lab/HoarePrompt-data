Output State: **`count` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`, `ans` is `ans + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value. Given that `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`, the expression `int(g / count) + 1` simplifies to `int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
