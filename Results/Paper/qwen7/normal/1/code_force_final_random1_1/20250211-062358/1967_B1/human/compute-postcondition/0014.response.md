Output State: **`countmins` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1`, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value. Given that `g` is initially calculated as `int(n / count) - 1`, which simplifies to `int(n / 2) - 1` (since `count` is 2), the updated value of `ans` becomes `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
