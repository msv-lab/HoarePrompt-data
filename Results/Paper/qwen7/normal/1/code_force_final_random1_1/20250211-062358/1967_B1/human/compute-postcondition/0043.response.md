Output State: **`count` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2)`, `ans` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to `int(n / count)`. Given that `count` is 2, `g` becomes `int(n / 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
