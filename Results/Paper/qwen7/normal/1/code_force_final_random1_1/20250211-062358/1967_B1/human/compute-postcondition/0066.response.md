Output State: **`count` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 4, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 3`, `ans` is `int((int(n / 2) - 3) / 2) + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 1. So, `g` becomes `int(n / 2) - 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `int(n / 2) - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
