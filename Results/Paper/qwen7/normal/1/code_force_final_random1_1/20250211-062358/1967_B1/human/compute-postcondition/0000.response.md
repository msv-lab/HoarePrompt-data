Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other preconditions remain valid.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the value entered by the user, converted to an integer, and it is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 10^4. The other conditions and constraints mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.
