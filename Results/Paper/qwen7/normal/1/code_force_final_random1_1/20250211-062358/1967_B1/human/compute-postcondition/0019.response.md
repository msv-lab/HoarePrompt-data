Output State: **`countmins` is 2, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1`, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`, `g` is now `int(n / 3)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. The values of `countmins`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, and `g` remain unchanged from their initial states.
