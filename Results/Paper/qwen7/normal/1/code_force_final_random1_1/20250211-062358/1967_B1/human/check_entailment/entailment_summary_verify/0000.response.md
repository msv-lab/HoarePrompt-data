### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description and Requirements
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program Analysis
The program iterates through values of `count` from 2 to `m` and attempts to update the count of valid pairs based on certain conditions. However, the logic used in the program does not correctly implement the required conditions.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

1. **Initialization**: `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are read.
2. **Loop through `count`**: The loop runs from 2 to `m`.
3. **Calculate `countmins`**: `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
4. **Calculate `g`**: `g` is calculated as `int(n / count)`.
5. **Break Condition**: If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
6. **Update `ans`**: `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1`.

This logic does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Specifically:
- The calculation of `g` as `int(n / count)` does not reflect the necessary gcd condition.
- The loop and the way `ans` is updated do not correctly count the valid pairs based on the given conditions.

#### Correct Implementation
A correct implementation would involve iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Conclusion
The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem. The logic used in the program does not correctly implement the necessary conditions for the pairs.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
