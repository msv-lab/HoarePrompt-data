### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to 2.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`. This suggests that the program might be counting pairs where `b = 1`, which is always valid since `a + 1` is always a multiple of `1`.

3. **Loop to Calculate Valid Pairs:**
   - The loop runs from `count = 2` to `count <= m`.
   - For each `count`, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - It then calculates `g` as `n // count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks. This condition seems unnecessary and might not cover all cases correctly.
   - Otherwise, it updates `g` to `g - countmins`.
   - It then adds `int(g / count) + 1` to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed.

### Detailed Check

To verify the correctness, let's consider the logic more carefully:

- The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` simplifies to checking if `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- For `b = 1`, any `a` from 1 to `n` is valid, so `ans` should include `n` pairs.
- For other values of `b`, the condition `a + b` must be divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`. This means `a` must be of the form `k * b - b` for some integer `k`.

However, the current implementation does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the loop logic and the way `g` is updated do not accurately reflect the necessary conditions.

### Counterexample

Consider the test case `(10, 3)`:
- Valid pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, `(3, 1)`, `(4, 1)`, `(5, 1)`, `(6, 1)`, `(7, 1)`, `(8, 1)`, `(9, 1)`, `(10, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(3, 2)`, `(5, 2)`, `(7, 2)`, `(9, 2)`.
- The program should print `15`, but it prints `10`.

This shows that the current implementation is incorrect.

### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation would involve iterating over possible values of `b` and checking the condition directly without the current loop structure.

### Final Answer

Given the analysis, the original assessment was inaccurate due to the flawed logic in the current implementation.

**Final: False**
