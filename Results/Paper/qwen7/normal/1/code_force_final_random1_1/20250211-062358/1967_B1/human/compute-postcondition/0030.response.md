Postcondition: `countmins` is 3, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 5, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1 + int(int(n / 3) / 3) + 1`, `g` is `int(n / 4)`, and if `g` is less than 3, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `g` is not less than 3, no change occurs to the variables.
