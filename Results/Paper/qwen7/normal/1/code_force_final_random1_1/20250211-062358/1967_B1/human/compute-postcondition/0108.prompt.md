Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other preconditions remain valid.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    count = 2
    ans = n
    while count <= m:
        countmins = int(count - 1)
        g = int(n / count)
        if g < countmins:
            break
        g -= countmins
        ans += int(g / count) + 1
        count += 1
    print(int(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `count` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`, `ans` is `n + the sum of [int(int(n / i) / i) + 1 for i in range(2, m + 1)]`.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `count` will be `m + 1` because the loop increments `count` until it exceeds `m`. The value of `i` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop. `n` and `m` retain their original input values. The variable `countmins` will be `m - 1` since it is initialized as `count - 1` and `count` becomes `m + 1` at the end. The variable `g` will be `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1` based on the last iteration's calculation. Finally, `ans` accumulates the sum of the series where each term is `int(int(n / i) / i) + 1` for `i` ranging from 2 to `m`, inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `count` is `m + 1`, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an integer such that `m` is at least 4, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `ans` incremented by `int(g / count) + 1` for each iteration from 2 to `m`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `count` until it reaches `m + 1`. During each iteration, `countmins` is set to `count - 1`, and `g` is recalculated as `int(n / count) - m + 1`. If `g` becomes less than `countmins` at any point, the loop breaks early. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value. After the loop completes, `count` will be `m + 1`, and `ans` will reflect the cumulative sum of the increments based on the conditions within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `count` is less than or equal to `m`. After all iterations, `count` will be equal to `m + 1`. Since `m` is at least 4, `count` will be at least 5. 

During each iteration, `countmins` is set to `count - 1`, `g` is calculated as `int(n / count) - countmins`, and `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value. The loop breaks when `g` becomes less than `countmins`.

After all iterations, the final value of `ans` will be the sum of the initial value of `n` plus the contributions from each iteration of the loop. Each contribution is `int(g / count) + 1` where `g` is reduced by `countmins` in each step.

Since we do not know the exact value of `n` and `m`, we can only describe the general form of the output state. The output state after the loop executes all iterations will have:

- `count` equal to `m + 1`
- `i` still equal to 2
- `n` still equal to the input integer provided by the user
- `m` still at least 4
- `countmins` will be `m`
- `g` will be 0 (since the loop breaks when `g` is less than `countmins`)
- `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `int(g / count) + 1` for each iteration from 2 to `m`

In natural language, the output state after all iterations of the loop will have `count` equal to `m + 1`, `i` still 2, `n` unchanged, `m` unchanged, `countmins` equal to `m`, `g` equal to 0, and `ans` equal to the initial value of `n` plus the sum of the contributions from each iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
