Postcondition: `impossible` remains `True`, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than `1`. After the loop executes all its iterations, if none of the conditions `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` were met for any `i` in the range of `n-1`, then `impossible` will still be `True`. If any of these conditions were met at any point, `impossible` would become `False`.
