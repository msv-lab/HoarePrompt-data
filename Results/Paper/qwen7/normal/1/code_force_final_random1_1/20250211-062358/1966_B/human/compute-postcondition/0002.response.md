Output State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` is an integer from the input split**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and splits them into two variables `n` and `m`. The variable `tc` remains unchanged and is still set to 1. Therefore, the updated state includes `tc` being 1, and `n` and `m` holding the integers from the input split.
