Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` and the grid configuration `gr`.

2. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the top-left and bottom-right cells (`gr[0][0]` and `gr[n-1][m-1]`) are of the same color. If they are different, it sets `ans` to 'NO' and proceeds to check if all cells in the first row and the last column are the same color. This is because if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, and there are no other cells in the grid that can force the entire grid to be uniform, then it's impossible to achieve the goal.

3. **Row and Column Checks**: 
   - It checks if all cells in the first row are the same color.
   - It checks if all cells in the last column are the same color.
   - If either of these checks fails, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.

4. **Final Output**: The program prints 'YES' if the grid can be made uniform and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the annotated program correctly identifies whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. The state information provided in the comment aligns with the expected behavior of the program.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
