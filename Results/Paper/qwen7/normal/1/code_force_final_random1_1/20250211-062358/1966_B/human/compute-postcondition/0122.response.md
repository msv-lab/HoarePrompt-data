Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `ans` is 'NO'
   - `impossible` is True
   - `gr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user
   - `j` is 2

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `i` is `n-1`, so for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `n` (i.e., `i` becomes `n`).
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to continue.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now `n`
   - `n` remains the same (must be greater than or equal to 1)
   - `ans` remains 'NO'
   - `impossible` remains True
   - `gr` remains the same
   - `j` remains 2

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `gr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user, `j` is 2**
