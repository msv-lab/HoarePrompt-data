Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `0` to `m - 2` (since `range(m - 1)` generates values from `0` to `m - 2`).

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - Either the first element of the first row in the `gr` matrix is not equal to the second element of the first row, or the first element of the last row in the `gr` matrix is not equal to the second element of the last row.
   - `impossible` remains `False`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `j < m - 1`. Therefore, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to check the next value.
   - The new value of `j` will be `3` (i.e., `j = 2 + 1`).
   - The condition `m >= 1` remains unchanged as it is a constraint on `m` and not directly affected by the loop.
   - The condition regarding the `gr` matrix and `impossible` flag also remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are only the ones related to `j`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and either the first element of the first row in the `gr` matrix is not equal to the second element of the first row, or the first element of the last row in the `gr` matrix is not equal to the second element of the last row; `impossible` remains `False`.**
