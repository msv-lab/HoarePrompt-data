Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n` in the statement `for i in range(n - 1):`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `impossible` remains `True`
   - `ans` is 'NO'
   - `i` is `1`
   - `n` must be greater than `1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`. This means the loop will run as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `1`, it will become `2`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `1` for the loop to continue.

5. **Consider the condition that makes `impossible` False**: The condition `impossible` becomes `False` if `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`. However, since this condition is not directly related to the loop head variables, we don't need to change the `impossible` state here. We just need to ensure the loop continues based on the loop head variables.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `i` is `2`
- `n` must be greater than `1`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`impossible` remains `True`, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is `2`, `n` must be greater than `1`**
