Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `ans` is 'NO'
   - `impossible` is True
   - `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user
   - `j` is 2

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-2`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i+1`).
   - Therefore, `i` will become `n-1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop but not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` becomes `n-1`
   - `n` remains the same (greater than or equal to 1)
   - `ans` remains 'NO'
   - `impossible` remains True
   - `gr` remains the same (a list containing one element which is the input from the user)
   - `j` remains 2

So, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `j` is 2**
