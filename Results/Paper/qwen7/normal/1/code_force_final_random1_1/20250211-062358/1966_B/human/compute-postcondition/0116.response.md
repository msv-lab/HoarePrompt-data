Output State: **`tc` is 3, `i` is `n-2`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements where the first element is not equal to the last element, `j` is 2**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values replace the previous values of `n` and `m` respectively. All other variables (`tc`, `i`, `ans`, `impossible`, `gr`, `j`) remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are now specific input values, while the other variables retain their initial conditions or values.
