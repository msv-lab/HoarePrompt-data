Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `j` and the condition variable `m` are the only variables mentioned in the loop head.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 3.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - Either the first element of the first row in the `gr` matrix is not equal to the second element of the first row, or the first element of the last row in the `gr` matrix is not equal to the second element of the last row.
   - `impossible` remains `False`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition is `j < m - 1`. Since `j` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `m - 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making it `j = 4`.
   - The condition `m >= 1` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - The postcondition involving the `gr` matrix and `impossible` flag remains the same because these conditions are not modified within the loop itself.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 4, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and either the first element of the first row in the `gr` matrix is not equal to the second element of the first row, or the first element of the last row in the `gr` matrix is not equal to the second element of the last row; `impossible` remains `False`**.
