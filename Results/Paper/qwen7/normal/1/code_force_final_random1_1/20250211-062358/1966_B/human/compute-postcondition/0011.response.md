Output State: `tc` is 1, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 2, `gr` is a list containing 4 elements which are the input values appended in each iteration.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `tc` remains unchanged at 1. The variable `i` will be equal to 4, indicating that the loop has completed 4 iterations. For the loop to run 4 times, `n` must have been greater than 3 initially. The list `gr` will contain 4 elements, each being an input value that was appended in each iteration of the loop.
