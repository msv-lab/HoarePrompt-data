Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 2
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `ans` is 'NO'
   - `impossible` is True
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n - 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same unless the loop body changes it, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `tc` remains 2.
   - `i` is now `n - 1`.
   - `ans` remains 'NO'.
   - `impossible` remains True.
   - `n` remains the same (greater than or equal to 1).
   - `gr` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user**.
