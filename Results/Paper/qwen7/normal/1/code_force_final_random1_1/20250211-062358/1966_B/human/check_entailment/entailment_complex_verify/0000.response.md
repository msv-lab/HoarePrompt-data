### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        ans = 'YES'
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        print(ans)
```

#### Annotated Code:
- **Initial State**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Each test case consists of \(n\) and \(m\), both positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 500\), and a grid of size \(n \times m\) filled with characters 'W' and 'B'. The sum of \(n \cdot m\) over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).
- **Key Checks**:
  - The program first checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color.
  - If they are different, it further checks if all cells in the first row and last column are the same color.
  - If either of these checks fails, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness**: **False**
- **Explanation**: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color. If they are different, it incorrectly concludes that it is impossible to make all squares the same color. However, this is not always true.

#### Analysis:
1. **Top-Left and Bottom-Right Corners Check**:
   - This check is insufficient because it does not consider the possibility that all rows or all columns might be the same color.
   
2. **Rows and Columns Check**:
   - The original assessment suggests checking if all rows or all columns are the same color, which is a more comprehensive approach.
   - If all rows are the same, then selecting any two squares in the same row will eventually change the entire row to the same color.
   - Similarly, if all columns are the same, then selecting any two squares in the same column will eventually change the entire column to the same color.

#### Corrected Version:
The provided corrected version in the original assessment is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        ans = 'YES'
        
        # Check if all rows are the same
        for i in range(1, n):
            if gr[i] != gr[0]:
                ans = 'NO'
                break
        
        # If all rows are the same, check if all columns are the same
        if ans == 'YES':
            for j in range(1, m):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][0]:
                    ans = 'NO'
                    break
        
        print(ans)
```

#### Evaluation:
- **Correctness**: The corrected version checks if all rows are the same and, if so, checks if all columns are the same. This approach is more robust and covers all possible scenarios.
- **Behavior**: The corrected version correctly identifies whether it is possible to make all squares the same color by ensuring that either all rows or all columns are the same.

### Final Decision:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The given program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and the provided corrected version is indeed a better solution.

**Final: True**
