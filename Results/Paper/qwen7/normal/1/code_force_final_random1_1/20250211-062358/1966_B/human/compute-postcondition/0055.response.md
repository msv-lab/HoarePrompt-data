Based on the initial state provided:

- `tc` is 1
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `n` is `j + 1`
- `m` is greater than 3
- `ans` is 'NO'
- `impossible` is True

The code snippet is:
```python
print(ans)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The value of `ans` is explicitly given as 'NO'.
2. The print statement simply outputs the value of `ans`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the string 'NO'.

Output: **'NO'**
