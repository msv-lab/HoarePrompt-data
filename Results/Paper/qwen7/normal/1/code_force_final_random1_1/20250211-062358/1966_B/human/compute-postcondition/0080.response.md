Postcondition: `tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False. If the first element's j-th index in `gr` is not equal to the (j+1)-th index of the first element, or the last element's j-th index in `gr` is not equal to the (j+1)-th index of the last element, then these variables retain their initial values.
