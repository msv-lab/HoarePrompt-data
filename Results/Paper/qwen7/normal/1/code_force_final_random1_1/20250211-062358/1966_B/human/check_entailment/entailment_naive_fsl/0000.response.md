Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color. If they are different, it incorrectly concludes that it is impossible to make all squares the same color. However, this is not always true. 

Consider the following grid:
```
BB
BB
```
In this case, the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same ('B'), but it is still impossible to make all squares the same color because no operation can change the color of the grid since selecting any two squares will only change the color within a subrectangle that includes those two squares, and there are no other squares to change.

The program should instead check if all rows or all columns are the same color, as this would allow us to make all squares the same color through a series of operations. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        ans = 'YES'
        
        # Check if all rows are the same
        for i in range(1, n):
            if gr[i] != gr[0]:
                ans = 'NO'
                break
        
        # If all rows are the same, check if all columns are the same
        if ans == 'YES':
            for j in range(1, m):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][0]:
                    ans = 'NO'
                    break
        
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly identifies whether it is possible to make all squares the same color by checking if all rows or all columns are the same color.
