Output State: **`tc` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `gr` is a list containing an input value.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `input()` to the list `gr`. Since no specific value is given for `input()`, we represent it as a generic input value. The other variables (`tc`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
