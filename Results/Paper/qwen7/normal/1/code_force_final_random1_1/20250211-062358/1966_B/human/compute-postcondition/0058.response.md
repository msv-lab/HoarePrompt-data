Output State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `gr`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `tc`, `i`, `ans`, `impossible`, `n`, and `m` as they were in the initial state, while adding that `gr` is now an empty list.
