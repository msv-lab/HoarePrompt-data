Output State: `tc` is 2, `i` is `n-2`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is False, `n` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements where the first element is not equal to the last element, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will increment from 0 to `n-2` (since the loop runs `n-1` times). The variable `impossible` will remain `False` as long as the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` holds true for at least one iteration. The other variables (`tc`, `ans`, `n`, `gr`, `m`, `j`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop body.
