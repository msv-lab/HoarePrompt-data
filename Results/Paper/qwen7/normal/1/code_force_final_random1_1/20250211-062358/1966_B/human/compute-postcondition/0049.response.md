Output State: `impossible` is False, `m` must be greater than 3, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is `j + 1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n - 2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive). The variable `j` remains unchanged at `m - 2`. The condition `impossible` is set to `False` if any pair of consecutive rows in the grid do not match in the first or last column during the loop's execution. The value of `m` must remain greater than 3 and `ans` remains 'NO' unless there is additional logic within the loop that changes it, which is not provided here.
