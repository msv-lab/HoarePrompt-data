Output State: **`impossible` is `False`, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and either the first element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the first element of `gr[i + 1]` or the last element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the last element of `gr[i + 1]`.**

The code sets `impossible` to `False`, which changes its state from `True` to `False`. The values of `ans`, `i`, `n`, and the condition involving the list `gr` remain unchanged.
