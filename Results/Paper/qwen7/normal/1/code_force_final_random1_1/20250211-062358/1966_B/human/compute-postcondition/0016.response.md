Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `m - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j` being initialized to 0 (as is typical for `range(m - 1)`), we need to set `j` to 0.

3. **Determine the Value of `m`**: The loop will continue as long as `j < m - 1`. Therefore, `m` must be greater than 1 (since `j` starts at 0 and we need at least one iteration).

4. **Check the Given Conditions**: We know that `n` must be greater than 3, but this condition does not directly affect the loop execution based on the loop head. The same goes for `gr`, `ans`, and `impossible`.

5. **Adjust the States**: Based on the above analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `j` and `m`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to:

**State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1**
