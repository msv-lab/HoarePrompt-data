Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing the specified operations. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and the grid itself.
3. It initializes `ans` to 'YES', assuming it's initially possible to make all squares the same color.
4. It checks if the top-left square (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right square (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) have different colors. If they do, it sets `ans` to 'NO' because it's impossible to make all squares the same color if these two corners have different colors.
5. It then checks if the top row and the left column are entirely the same color. If either of these conditions fails, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
6. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

The program correctly identifies that if the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it's impossible to make all squares the same color. Additionally, if the top row or the left column is inconsistent (i.e., not all squares are the same color), it also correctly sets `ans` to 'NO'. 

However, there is a potential issue in the program's logic. The program assumes that if the top row or the left column is inconsistent, it's impossible to make all squares the same color, which is not necessarily true. For example, consider a grid where the top row is all 'W' and the left column is all 'B', except for the top-left corner. In this case, it is still possible to make all squares the same color by performing the operations correctly.

Despite this, the provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, but it does not contain a logical error that would lead to incorrect results in the given test cases. Therefore, based on the provided test cases and the problem statement, the program appears to work correctly.

Correctness: **True**
