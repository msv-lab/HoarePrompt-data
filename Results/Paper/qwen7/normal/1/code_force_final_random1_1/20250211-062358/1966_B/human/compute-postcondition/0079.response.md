Postcondition: `tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False. If the first element at index `j` of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the next element at index `j+1` of the same sublist, or if the last element at index `j` of the last sublist in `gr` is not equal to the next element at index `j+1` of the same sublist, then `tc`, `i`, `ans`, `impossible`, and the state of `gr` remain unchanged.
