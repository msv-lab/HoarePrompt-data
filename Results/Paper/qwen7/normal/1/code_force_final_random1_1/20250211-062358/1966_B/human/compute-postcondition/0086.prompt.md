Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, the first element of `gr` is not equal to the last element of `gr
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m - 1):
    if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
        impossible = False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, the first element of `gr` is not equal to the last element of `gr`, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 0. If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first sublist or the first element of the last sublist in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last sublist, the conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False. If the first element's j-th index in `gr` is not equal to the (j+1)-th index of the first element, or the last element's j-th index in `gr` is not equal to the (j+1)-th index of the last element, then these variables retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, `j` is 1. If `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, the conditions remain the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
