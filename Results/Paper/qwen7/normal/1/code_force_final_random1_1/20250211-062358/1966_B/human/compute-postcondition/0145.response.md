Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and either the first element of the first row in the `gr` matrix is not equal to the second element of the first row, or the first element of the last row in the `gr` matrix is not equal to the second element of the last row; `impossible` remains `True`; `ans` is 'NO'**.

The code assigns the string `'NO'` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `j`, `m`, the conditions on the `gr` matrix, and `impossible` remain unchanged.
