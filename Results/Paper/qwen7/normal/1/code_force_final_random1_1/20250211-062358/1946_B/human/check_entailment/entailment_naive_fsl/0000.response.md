Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the array contains only negative numbers. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
1
5 1
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```

The program calculates the suffix sums and uses them to find the maximum possible sum after one operation. However, it does not account for the fact that inserting the sum of the entire array (which would be the sum of all negative numbers) could potentially increase the sum of the array. For the given example, the correct output should be `-15`, but the program incorrectly outputs `0`.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the sum of the entire array as a potential value to insert during the operation. This can be done by checking if the sum of the array is greater than the current maximum sum calculated using the suffix sums.
