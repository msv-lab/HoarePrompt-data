Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[4] - smin[4]`.
- If `suf[4] - smin[4]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is -111, then `sm` is set to `suf[4] - smin[4]`.
- Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `n`, we need to update these variables.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to `n` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n` inclusive).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `n + 1`.
   - However, since the loop condition is `i < n + 1`, once `i` reaches `n + 1`, the loop will terminate.

### Updated State
- The value of `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `n + 1`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.

### Final State
State: **`sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[4] - smin[4]`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` remains unchanged.**

Since `sm` is not directly affected by the loop control variables `i` and `n`, its value remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration unless explicitly updated within the loop body.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[4] - smin[4]`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` remains unchanged.**
