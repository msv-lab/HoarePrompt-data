Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, and `smin` has an additional element which is `suf[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given that `i` is 0, `suf[0 + 1]` is `suf[1]`. So, `smin` now contains an extra element, which is `suf[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
