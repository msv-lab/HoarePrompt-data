Output State: **`sm` is -2 plus (2 + 1) times (10^9 + 7), `a` is 2.**

Explanation: The initial value of `sm` is -2. The code updates `sm` by adding `(a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)` to its current value. Given `a` is 2, `(a + 1)` equals 3. Therefore, `sm` is updated to `-2 + 3 * (10 ** 9 + 7)`. The value of `a` remains unchanged.
