Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `smin` is a list where each element i (from 0 to n-1) contains the sum of all elements in `l` from index 0 to i, and no other variables (`sm`, `a`, `b`, `j`, `n`, `k`, `l`) will change from their final values after the last iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
        smin.append(suf[i + 1])
    else:
        smin.append(smin[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` has an additional element which is `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `smin` has an additional element which is equal to `smin[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. If `suf[2] < smin[1]`, then `smin` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `smin` has an additional element which is equal to `smin[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and `smin` is updated such that if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin[i]` is set to `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `smin` remains unchanged with its value at index `i` appended to itself.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
