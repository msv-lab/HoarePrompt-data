Output State: **`sm` is now equal to -2, `a` is 2, and the value of `sm` is less than 0.**

Explanation: Given the initial state where `sm` is now equal to 2 + `suf[n]`, and the value of `sm` is less than 0, we can infer that `suf[n]` must be -4 because 2 + (-4) = -2. The value of `sm` is updated to -2. The code then assigns `a` the value of `abs(sm)` divided by `(10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since `sm` is -2, `abs(sm)` is 2. Dividing 2 by `(10 ** 9 + 7)` results in `a` being 2. The value of `sm` remains -2, which is still less than 0.
