Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `smin` has its value at index `i` appended to itself.**

Explanation: The code `smin.append(smin[i])` appends the value at index `i` of the list `smin` to itself. Given that `i` is 2, it appends `smin[2]` to `smin`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
