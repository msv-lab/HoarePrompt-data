Output State: **`sm` is 2 + `suf[n]`**

Explanation: The variable `sm` is updated by adding the value of `suf[n]` to its current value. Since `sm` was initially 2, after executing `sm += suf[n]`, `sm` becomes `2 + suf[n]`. The value of `n` and the contents of `suf` are not specified, so they remain unchanged.
