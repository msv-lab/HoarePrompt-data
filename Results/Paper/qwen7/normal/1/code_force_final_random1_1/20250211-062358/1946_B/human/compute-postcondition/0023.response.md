Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is less than `n`, `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`, `smin` is a list with one additional element which is equal to `smin[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. Since `smin` was previously a list, now it contains one more element which is specifically `smin[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
