Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n):`. This means the variables `i` and `n` are the only ones that can be adjusted.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split.
   - `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1]]`.
   - `n` is the length of the list `l`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `b` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `l` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `suf` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is `i + 1` and `i` must be less than `n`**.
