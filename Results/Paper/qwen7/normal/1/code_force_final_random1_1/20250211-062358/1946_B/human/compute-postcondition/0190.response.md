To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `sm` is an integer.
   - There are other variables (`a`, `n`, `suf`) that are not explicitly defined, but their values do not affect the final value of `sm` directly from the given information.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `sm < 0`, then `sm` is updated to `(sm + (a + 1) * (10`.
   - Otherwise, `sm` is set to `2 + suf[n]` modulo 10.

Since the exact values of `sm`, `a`, `n`, and `suf` are not provided, we need to consider both possible scenarios for `sm`:

- **Scenario 1**: If `sm < 0`
  - In this case, `sm` is updated to `(sm + (a + 1) * 10`.
  - Since `sm` is initially less than 0, the new value of `sm` will be `(sm + (a + 1) * 10`.

- **Scenario 2**: If `sm >= 0`
  - In this case, `sm` is set to `2 + suf[n]` modulo 10.
  - The exact value of `suf[n]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `sm` without it.

Given that the exact value of `sm` is not specified, we need to consider the general form of the output based on the conditions:

- If `sm` is less than 0, the output will be the result of `(sm + (a + 1) * 10)`.
- If `sm` is greater than or equal to 0, the output will be `(2 + suf[n]) % 10`.

Since the exact value of `sm` is not given, we can only describe the output in terms of the conditions provided.

Output: **(sm + (a + 1) * 10) if sm < 0, otherwise (2 + suf[n]) % 10**
