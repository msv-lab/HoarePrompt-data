### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly parses the input values `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `l` for each test case.
   
2. **Suffix Sum Calculation**:
   - The suffix sums (`suf`) are correctly computed, starting with `suf[0] = 0` and then adding each element of `l` to the previous suffix sum.
   
3. **Minimum Suffix Sum Calculation**:
   - The minimum suffix sums (`smin`) are correctly computed, ensuring that `smin[i+1]` is the minimum value between `suf[i+1]` and `smin[i]`.
   
4. **Maximum Possible Sum Calculation**:
   - The variable `sm` is initialized to `-111` to handle the case where no valid operation is performed initially. It then iterates through the suffix sums to find the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - The formula `2 ** k * sm - sm` is used to account for the effect of `k` operations, which is mathematically sound for this problem.
   - The final sum is adjusted to be non-negative and within the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) range.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program correctly handles the modulo operation to ensure the result is within the required range.

Given the above points, the logic in the program appears to be correct and aligns with the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after performing `k` operations, and it handles the modulo operation appropriately.
