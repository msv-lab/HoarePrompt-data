Output State: **`sm` is `suf[4] - smin[4]`, `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The variable `sm` is updated to the value of `suf[i] - smin[i]`, where `i` is 4. The values of `suf` and `smin` at index 4 are used to calculate the new value of `sm`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 4, and the initial state of `n` is not affected by this operation.
