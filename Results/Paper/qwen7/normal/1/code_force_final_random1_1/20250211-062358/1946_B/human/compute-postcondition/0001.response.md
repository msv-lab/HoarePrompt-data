State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and t must be an integer value between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `j` is initialized within the loop head (`for j in range(t)`).
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
3. The problem statement mentions that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive). Therefore, `t` must fall within this range.
4. Since `t` is derived from the input, its exact value is unknown until the input is provided, but we know it must meet the specified conditions for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0 and must be an integer value between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive).
