Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping int to the input split, `suf` is [0]**.

Explanation: The code `suf.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `suf`. Initially, `suf` is an empty list. After executing this line of code, `suf` becomes `[0]`. All other variables (`t`, `b`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
