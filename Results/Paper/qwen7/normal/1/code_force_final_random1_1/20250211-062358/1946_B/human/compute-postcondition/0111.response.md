Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `sm` is updated based on the condition where either `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`.
- If the condition is met, `sm` is set to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.
- If the condition is not met, `sm` remains `-111`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` is `N`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `i` starts from `0` and goes up to `n`.
- In the previous iteration, `i` was `k + 1`.
- For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 2`.

### Adjusting the States:
- The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n + 1`.
- Since `i` was `k + 1` in the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 2`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is defined outside the loop.

### Updated State:
- `sm` remains the same unless the condition is met in the next iteration.
- `i` will be `k + 2`.
- `n` remains `N`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`sm` is updated based on the condition where either `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`. If the condition is met, `sm` is set to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. If the condition is not met, `sm` remains `-111`. Here, `i` is `k + 2`, and `n` is `N`.**
