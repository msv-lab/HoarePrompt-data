Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, and `smin` is a list where the last element is the minimum value between the suffix minimum at index `i` and the suffix minimum at index `i + 1`. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, the last element of `smin` is updated to `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, the last element of `smin` remains `smin[i]`.
