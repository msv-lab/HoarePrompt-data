Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `smin` contains the suffix minimum at index `i + 1`, and the suffix minimum at index `i` is less than the suffix minimum at index `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the suffix minimum at index `i + 1` to the list `smin`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition about the suffix minimums is maintained.
