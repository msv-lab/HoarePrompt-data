Output State: **`sm` is now 2 + `suf[n]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), and `sm` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` by taking its modulus with \(10^9 + 7\). Since `sm` was initially set to `2 + suf[n]` and is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 0, the new value of `sm` will be `2 + suf[n]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
