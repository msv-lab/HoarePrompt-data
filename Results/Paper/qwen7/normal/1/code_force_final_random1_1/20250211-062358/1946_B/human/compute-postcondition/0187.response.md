Output State: **`sm` is 2 + `suf[n]` modulo (10 ** 9 + 7)**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to its value modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Given that `sm` was initially \(2 + \text{suf}[n]\) and is now updated to this value modulo \(10^9 + 7\), the new state of `sm` is \(2 + \text{suf}[n]\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
