Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - The postcondition for the loop body execution is:
     - If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` has an additional element which is `suf[i + 1]`.
     - Otherwise, `smin` has an additional element which is equal to `smin[i]`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition is `range(n)`, meaning `i` will iterate from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.

4. **Condition Check for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is now 1, the condition `i < n` must hold true for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

6. **Postcondition Adjustment:**
   - The postcondition for the loop body execution will depend on the value of `suf[1]` and `smin[0]`.
   - However, since we are only adjusting the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to explicitly state the postcondition here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
