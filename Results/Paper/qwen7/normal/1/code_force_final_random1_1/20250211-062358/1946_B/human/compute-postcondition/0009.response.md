Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends a new element to the list `suf`. Since `i` is not defined in the given context, we assume it refers to the index 0 (as it's the first time appending). Thus, `suf` changes from `[0]` to `[0, 0 + l[0]]`, which simplifies to `[0, l[0]]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
