Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and now `t` is set to the integer value of input().
Code of the loop:
for j in range(t):
    b = input().split()
    n = int(b[0])
    k = int(b[1])
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    suf = []
    suf.append(0)
    for i in range(n):
        suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])
    smin = [0]
    for i in range(n):
        if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
            smin.append(suf[i + 1])
        else:
            smin.append(smin[i])
    sm = -111
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111:
            sm = suf[i] - smin[i]
    sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm
    sm += suf[n]
    if sm < 0:
        a = abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)
        sm += (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)
    else:
        sm = sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)
    print(sm)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `sm` is now equal to 2 + `suf[n]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). If `sm` is less than 0, then `sm` is adjusted to be \(-2 + (2 + 1) \times (10^9 + 7)\) and `a` is set to 2. Otherwise, `sm` remains as 2 + `suf[n]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `sm` is an integer. If `sm` is less than 0, then `sm` is set to 0 and `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\). Otherwise, `sm` is set to \(2 + \text{suf}[n]\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and remains non-negative.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `sm` is an integer. If `sm` is less than 0, then `sm` is updated to `(sm + (a + 1) * (10`. Otherwise, `sm` is equal to `2 + suf[n]` modulo 10.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
