Output State: **sm is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `n`.**

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop, the variable `sm` will hold the highest value that satisfies the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`. Since the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n` (inclusive) and updates `sm` whenever the condition is met, `sm` will eventually store the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` across all iterations. If no update occurs, `sm` will retain its initial value of -111.
