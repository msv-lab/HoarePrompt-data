Output State: **`ans` is a list containing all intermediate products of `tem` as each element of `arr` is processed from the end to the beginning, `i` is -1, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`**

In this output state:
- `ans` is a list that contains all the intermediate products of `tem` as each element of `arr` is processed from the end to the beginning. This means if `arr` is `[a1, a2, a3]`, then `ans` would be `[a1*a2*a3, a2*a3, a3]`.
- `i` is set to `-1` because the loop processes the elements of `arr` from the last index to the first, and after the loop completes, `i` is decremented to `-1`.
- `tem` holds the product of all elements in `arr` after the loop completes.
