Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[i] * arr[i]`, `ans` is a list containing the value `tem + [tem]`**

Explanation: The code multiplies `tem` by `arr[i]`. Initially, `tem` was the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[i]`. After multiplying `tem` by `arr[i]`, `tem` now becomes the product of all elements in `arr`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
