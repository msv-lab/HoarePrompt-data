Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[i]`, `ans` is a list containing the value `tem`.**

Explanation: The code multiplies `tem` by `arr[i]`, where `i` is `len(arr) - 2`. After this operation, `tem` now includes the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[i]`. The value of `i` is updated to `len(arr) - 1` because `i` was incremented by 1 during the multiplication. The other variables (`arr`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
