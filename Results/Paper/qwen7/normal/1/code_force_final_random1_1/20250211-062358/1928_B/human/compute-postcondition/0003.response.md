Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `ans` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code multiplies the value of `arr[i]` (which is the last element of the list `arr`) to the variable `tem`. Since `i` is initially set to `len(arr) - 1`, `arr[i]` refers to the last element of the list. After executing `tem *= arr[i]`, `tem` is updated to be the product of all elements in `arr`. The states of other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
