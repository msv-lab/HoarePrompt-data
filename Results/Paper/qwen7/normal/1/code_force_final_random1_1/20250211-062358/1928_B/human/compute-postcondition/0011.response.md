Output State: `arr` is a list of positive integers, `i` is `-1`, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `ans` is a list containing all intermediate products of `tem` as each element in `arr` is processed from the last to the first.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `arr` remains a list of positive integers, `i` becomes `-1` (since the loop decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`), `tem` holds the product of all elements in `arr`, and `ans` is a list that contains every intermediate value of `tem` after each iteration of the loop, starting from the product of all elements down to the product of all but the last element.
