Output State: **`egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1, -1, egalites // 2`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `egalites // 2` to the list `resultats`. The value of `egalites` remains unchanged, and the rest of the variables (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`) also remain unchanged. The updated `resultats` list includes the new value calculated from `egalites // 2`.
