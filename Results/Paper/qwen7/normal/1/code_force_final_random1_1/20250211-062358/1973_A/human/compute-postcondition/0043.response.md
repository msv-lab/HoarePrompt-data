Postcondition: `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1, -1`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, then `resultats` is updated to contain `-1, -1`.
