You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string, 'str' has 3 or more characters
```
return str
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
Output State: **The program returns string 'str' that has 3 or more characters **


Example2:
Initial State: `numbers` is an empty list, `total` is the sum of all positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `count` is the number of positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `average` is equal to `total / count`
```
return A
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
Output State: **The program returns average whuih is equal to total/count , where total is the sum of all positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `count` is the number of positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list**

Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
return n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the program returns either 4 or 6.
Output State: **The program returns 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is 1, `y` is  greater than 3 , `z` is 0
```
retrun y+x
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
`y' is 0 and 'x' is one so the program returns  0+1=1.
Output State: **`The program returns y that is greater than 3 plus 1**

Example4:
Initial State: `count' contains the number of numbers greater than 1 in the list `numbers`, 'numbers' is a list of integers, 'total' is 0
```
retrun count
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
Output State: **`The program returns the number of integers greater than 1 in list 'numbers' **


Your Task:
Initial State: Output State: The `resultats` list will contain one of the following based on the conditions checked within the loop for each inner list in `cas_de_test`:

- If any of the conditions cause `-1` to be appended to `resultats`, then `resultats` will end up being a list of `-1`s, with the length equal to the number of inner lists in `cas_de_test`.
- If none of the conditions cause `-1` to be appended and all `egalites // 2` values are valid, then `resultats` will be a list containing these valid `egalites // 2` values.

The `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` variables will be the last values from the last inner list processed in `cas_de_test`. The `total_points` will be the sum of the last `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. `total_matchs` will be `total_points // 2`. `egalites` will be calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and if it's non-negative, `egalites // 2` will be appended to `resultats`.

If all inner lists in `cas_de_test` pass all conditions without appending `-1`, the final `resultats` will be a list of `egalites // 2` values for each inner list. If any inner list causes `-1` to be appended, `resultats` will consist of `-1`s followed by any valid `egalites // 2` values.
```
return resultats

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate what the program returns. Any variable or value that is included in the return, describe all the information we have for it.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans
