Reasoning:

1. The program defines a function `func_1` that processes a list of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players.
2. The function checks several conditions to ensure the scores are consistent with the rules of the game:
   - The total points must be even.
   - The total number of matches should not exceed 3 (since each match awards up to 2 points).
   - The highest score should not exceed the total number of matches.
   - The number of draws is calculated and checked to be non-negative.
3. The provided execution summary aligns with the logic implemented in the code:
   - It correctly initializes the function with the test cases.
   - It processes each test case according to the defined conditions.
   - It handles invalid cases by appending `-1` to the result list.
   - It calculates the number of draws correctly using the formula `egalites // 2`.
4. The test cases in the execution summary cover various scenarios, including valid and invalid cases, which the code handles appropriately.
5. The final output matches the expected results for the given input.

Given the alignment between the implementation and the problem description, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
