The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 500, and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` such that `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`. For each inner list in `cas_de_test`, it checks several conditions. If any condition fails, `-1` is appended to the result list `resultats`. If all conditions pass, `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`. After processing all inner lists, the function returns the list `resultats`. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` hold the last values from the last inner list processed, `total_points` is the sum of the last `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, and `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, with `egalites // 2` appended to `resultats` if non-negative.
