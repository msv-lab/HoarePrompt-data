Postcondition: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `resultats` is a list with an additional element either `-1` or `egalites // 2`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` depending on whether `egalites` is less than 0 or not.**
