Output State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the first inner list, `p2` is the second value from the first inner list, `p3` is the third value from the first inner list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and `resultats` is a list containing `-1`. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop continues, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
