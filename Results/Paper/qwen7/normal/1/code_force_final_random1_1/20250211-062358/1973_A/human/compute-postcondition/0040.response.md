Output State: **`p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `total_matchs = total_points // 2` calculates the integer division of `total_points` by 2 and assigns the result to `total_matchs`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, and `resultats` remain unchanged from their initial states.
