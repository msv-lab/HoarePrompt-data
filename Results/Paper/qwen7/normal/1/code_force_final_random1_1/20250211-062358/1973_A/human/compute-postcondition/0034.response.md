Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each inner list in `cas_de_test`. Each iteration extracts the first, second, and third values from the next inner list.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - `p1` will be the first value from the next inner list.
   - `p2` will be the second value from the next inner list.
   - `p3` will be the third value from the next inner list.

4. **Initial Values at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `cas_de_test` is a list of lists.
   - `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`.
   - `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`.
   - `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`.
   - `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`.
   - `resultats` is a list with an additional element either `-1` or `egalites // 2`.
   - `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` depending on whether `egalites` is less than 0 or not.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be updated to the next set of values from the inner list in `cas_de_test`.
   - The other variables (`total_points`, `total_matchs`, `resultats`, and `egalites`) will be recalculated based on the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

**State:**
- `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`.
- `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`.
- `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`**.
