Output State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the first inner list, `p2` is the second value from the first inner list, `p3` is the third value from the first inner list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `-1` to the list `resultats`. Since `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `total_points` were part of the initial state and their values remain unchanged, they are included in the output state. The new list `resultats` now contains the value `-1`.
