Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The program correctly validates the input constraints, ensuring \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\) and \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).

2. **Total Points Calculation**: The program calculates the total points correctly as the sum of the points of the three players.

3. **Total Matches Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the total number of matches as half of the total points. This is because each match contributes 2 points in total (either 2-0 or 1-1).

4. **Draw Condition Check**: The program checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score exceeds the total number of matches. If either condition is true, it appends -1 to the result list, indicating an invalid set of scores.

5. **Egalites Calculation**: The program calculates the number of draws using the formula \( \text{egalites} = \text{total\_points} - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p2}) - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p1}) \). This formula ensures that the difference in points between the players is accounted for by the number of draws.

6. **Result List Construction**: The program constructs the result list by appending either -1 or the calculated number of draws for each set of scores. 

Given the provided example and the logic in the code, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It handles all edge cases and follows the specified rules for determining the maximum number of draws.

Correctness: **True**
