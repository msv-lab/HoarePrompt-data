Output State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `resultats` is a list with an additional element `egalites // 2`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `egalites // 2` to the `resultats` list. The value of `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. After appending `egalites // 2` to `resultats`, the updated `resultats` list includes this new value. All other variables remain unchanged.
