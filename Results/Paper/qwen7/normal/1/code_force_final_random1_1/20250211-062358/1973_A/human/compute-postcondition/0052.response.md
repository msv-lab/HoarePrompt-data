Output State: **The program returns a list `resultats` which contains either `-1` for each inner list in `cas_de_test` if any condition causes `-1` to be appended, or `egalites // 2` for each valid inner list in `cas_de_test` if no `-1` is appended. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the last values from the last inner list processed in `cas_de_test`. `total_points` is the sum of the last `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and if it's non-negative, `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`.**

This output state describes the possible contents of the `resultats` list based on the conditions checked within the loop for each inner list in `cas_de_test`. It also specifies the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, and `egalites` as derived from the last inner list processed.
