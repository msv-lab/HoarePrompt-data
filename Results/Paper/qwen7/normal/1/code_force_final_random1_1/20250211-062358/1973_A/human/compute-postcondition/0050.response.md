Output State: The `cas_de_test` list remains unchanged, `resultats` is a list containing `-1` repeated for each inner list in `cas_de_test`, and the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, and `egalites` depend on the specific inner lists in `cas_de_test`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `resultats` will contain `-1` for every inner list in `cas_de_test`. This is because the loop continues with `-1` being appended to `resultats` whenever `total_points` is odd or when certain conditions are not met (like `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`). Since these conditions are met for each iteration based on the given output states after the first three iterations, it implies that the same conditions will be met for all iterations. Therefore, `-1` is appended to `resultats` in each iteration, resulting in a list of `-1`s whose length matches the number of inner lists in `cas_de_test`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, and `egalites` will vary based on the specific values in each inner list of `cas_de_test`, but they will be calculated according to the logic inside the loop for each iteration.
