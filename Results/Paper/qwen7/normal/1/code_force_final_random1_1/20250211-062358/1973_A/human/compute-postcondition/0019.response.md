Postcondition: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the first inner list, `p2` is the second value from the first inner list, `p3` is the third value from the first inner list, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`, `-1`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is `2 * p2 + 2 * p1 - total_points`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `egalites` remains as `2 * p2 + 2 * p1 - total_points`. Otherwise, `egalites` is updated to `egalites // 2`.**
