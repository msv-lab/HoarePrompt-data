Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `year` is 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `year` and `n` remain unchanged.
