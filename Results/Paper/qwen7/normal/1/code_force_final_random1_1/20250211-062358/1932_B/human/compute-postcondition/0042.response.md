Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of sub-cases, followed by t pairs of integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each sub-case, it returns information based on the values of n and the list a_i.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a count of sub-cases (t), the number of elements in each sub-case (n), and a list of positive integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The function processes each sub-case and returns some form of output based on the values of n and the list a_i, without explicitly taking any parameters in its definition.
