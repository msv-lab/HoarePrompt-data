Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is either equal to `current_year + ai` if `current_year % ai == 0`, or equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` otherwise, `a` contains at least one element.**

Explanation: The line `current_year = next_year` simply assigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`. This does not change the condition or value of `next_year`, which remains either `current_year + ai` if `current_year % ai == 0`, or `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` otherwise. The list `a` also remains unchanged as it was not affected by this assignment.
