Postcondition: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `a` must contain at least one element, and `next_year` is either `current_year + ai` (where `ai` is the smallest element in `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0` and `current_year` is divisible by `ai`) or `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` (where `ai` is the smallest element in `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0`).**
