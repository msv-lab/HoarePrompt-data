Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `ai`, which is taken from the list `a`.

2. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.
   - `next_year` can be either `current_year + ai` or `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, where `ai` is the smallest element in `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `ai` is the variable being iterated over in the loop, it will change in each iteration.
   - `current_year` and `next_year` will also change based on the value of `ai`.

Given that `ai` is the variable being iterated over, and considering the possible values for `next_year`, we need to determine what `ai` will be in the next iteration.

Since `ai` is the smallest element in `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0`, and it changes in each iteration, we need to find the next smallest `ai` that divides `current_year`.

4. **State adjustment**:
   - The value of `ai` will change to the next smallest element in `a` that divides `current_year`.
   - `current_year` and `next_year` will be updated based on the new value of `ai`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `ai` will be the next smallest element in `a` that divides `current_year`.
- `current_year` will be updated to `next_year`, which could be either `current_year + ai` or `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, and `next_year` is either `current_year + ai` or `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, where `ai` is the next smallest element in `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0`**.
