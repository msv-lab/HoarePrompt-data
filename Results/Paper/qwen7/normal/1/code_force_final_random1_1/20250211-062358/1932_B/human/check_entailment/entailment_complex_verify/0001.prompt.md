You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        
        print(year)
        
    #State: Output State: The list `a` is empty, `year` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`, and `n` is the original input integer.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because all elements have been processed. The variable `year` will hold the cumulative sum of all elements in the original list `a`, as each element `ai` in `a` contributed to `year` in each iteration. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of sub-cases, then for each sub-case, it reads a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) positive integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). It calculates a value `year` by iterating through the list \( a \) and updating `year` based on the current element. Finally, it prints the calculated `year` for each sub-case. After processing all test cases, the list `a` is empty, and the variable `year` holds the cumulative sum of all elements from the original lists across all sub-cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `year` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the current year.

3. **Loop Through Periodicities:**
   - The program iterates over each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.
   - Inside the loop, it updates `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.

### Explanation of the Expression `year += year % ai or ai`:

- `year % ai`: This gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. If `year` is a multiple of `ai`, this value will be 0.
- `year % ai or ai`: This expression evaluates to `ai` if `year` is not a multiple of `ai` (i.e., `year % ai != 0`), and it evaluates to 0 if `year` is a multiple of `ai` (i.e., `year % ai == 0`).
- `year += year % ai or ai`: This effectively adds the smallest increment needed to make `year` a multiple of `ai` to `year`.

### Correctness Verification:

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

#### Example 1:
- Input: 
  ```
  6
  3 2 4 5 9 18
  ```

- Expected Output: 
  ```
  36
  ```

- **Calculation:**
  - Start with `year = 0`.
  - First iteration (`ai = 3`): `year % 3 == 0`, so `year += 3` → `year = 3`.
  - Second iteration (`ai = 2`): `year % 2 == 1`, so `year += 2` → `year = 5`.
  - Third iteration (`ai = 4`): `year % 4 == 1`, so `year += 4` → `year = 9`.
  - Fourth iteration (`ai = 5`): `year % 5 == 4`, so `year += 5` → `year = 14`.
  - Fifth iteration (`ai = 9`): `year % 9 == 5`, so `year += 9` → `year = 23`.
  - Sixth iteration (`ai = 18`): `year % 18 == 5`, so `year += 18` → `year = 41`.

  However, the expected output is 36, which suggests an error in the logic.

#### Example 2:
- Input: 
  ```
  5
  1 2 3 4 5
  ```

- Expected Output: 
  ```
  5
  ```

- **Calculation:**
  - Start with `year = 0`.
  - First iteration (`ai = 1`): `year % 1 == 0`, so `year += 1` → `year = 1`.
  - Second iteration (`ai = 2`): `year % 2 == 1`, so `year += 2` → `year = 3`.
  - Third iteration (`ai = 3`): `year % 3 == 0`, so `year += 3` → `year = 6`.
  - Fourth iteration (`ai = 4`): `year % 4 == 2`, so `year += 4` → `year = 10`.
  - Fifth iteration (`ai = 5`): `year % 5 == 0`, so `year += 5` → `year = 15`.

  Again, the expected output is 5, which indicates an error.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly compute the year in which all signs will occur. The logic in the expression `year += year % ai or ai` is flawed because it does not ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
