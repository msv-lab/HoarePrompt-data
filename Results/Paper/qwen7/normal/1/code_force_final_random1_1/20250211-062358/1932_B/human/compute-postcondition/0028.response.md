Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `year` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The initial state has `a` as an empty list and `year` as the sum of all elements in the original list `a`, which means `year` is 0. The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is an empty list, and `year` also remains unchanged as it was initially 0 and no operations were performed on it.
