Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` must have at least one element.
   - `ai` is the first element in the list `a`.
   - `year` is increased by `year % ai` or `ai`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a` using the variable `ai`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `ai` is the first element in the list `a` at the start of the current iteration, for the next iteration, `ai` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - The value of `year` will be updated based on the current `ai` (either `year % ai` or `ai`), but this does not affect the condition for the next iteration directly.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - `a` must still have at least one element.
   - `ai` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `year` will be updated, but its exact value is not relevant for determining if the loop can continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`a` must have at least one element, `ai` is the next element in the list `a`, `year` is updated based on the current `ai`**.
