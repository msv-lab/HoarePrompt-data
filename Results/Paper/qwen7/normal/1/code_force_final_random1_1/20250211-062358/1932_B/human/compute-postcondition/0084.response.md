Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (between 1 and 100) and a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 10^6). For each test case, the function calculates a sequence of `current_year` values and returns a list of these sequences, with the final value being the last `current_year` calculated.**
