Output State: **`current_year` is equal to the result of the last calculation `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` where `ai` is the smallest element in `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0`, and `results` contains the list of all `current_year` values calculated during the loop.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `current_year` to the list `results` after each iteration of the loop. The value of `current_year` is updated based on the smallest `ai` in the list `a` that satisfies the condition `current_year % ai == 0`. The list `a` remains unchanged, and `current_year` is updated according to the formula `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. After the loop completes, `current_year` holds the final value it was set to during the last iteration, and `results` contains all intermediate values of `current_year`.
