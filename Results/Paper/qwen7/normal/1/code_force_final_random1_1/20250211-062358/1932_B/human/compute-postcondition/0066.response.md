Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `a` contains at least one element. If there exists an element `ai` in the list `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` is equal to the current year plus the first occurrence of such `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` for the smallest `ai` in `a` where `current_year % ai == 0`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`. This means that the value of `current_year` is now the same as the value of `next_year`. The condition for calculating `next_year` remains unchanged, and the list `a` and its properties are unaffected by this assignment.
