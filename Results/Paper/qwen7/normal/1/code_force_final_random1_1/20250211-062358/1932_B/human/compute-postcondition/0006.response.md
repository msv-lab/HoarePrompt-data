Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`, `year` is increased by `year % ai` or `ai`.**

Explanation: The code `year += year % ai or ai` updates the value of `year` by adding to it either `year % ai` (if `year % ai` is not zero) or `ai` (if `year % ai` is zero). The initial state of `ai` being the first element in the list `a` and `a` having at least one element remains unchanged.
