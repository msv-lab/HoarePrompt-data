Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, and `next_year` is either `current_year + ai` (where `ai` is the smallest element in `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0` and `current_year` is divisible by `ai`) or `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` (where `ai` is the smallest element in `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0`).**

Explanation: The line `current_year = next_year` simply assigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`. This does not change the conditions under which `next_year` was defined. Therefore, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, and `next_year` still follows the same conditions as before: it is either `current_year + ai` (where `ai` is the smallest element in `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0` and `current_year` is divisible by `ai`) or `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` (where `ai` is the smallest element in `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0`).
