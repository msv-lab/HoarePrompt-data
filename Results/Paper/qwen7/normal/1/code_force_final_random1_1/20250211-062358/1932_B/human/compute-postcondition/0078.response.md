Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, and `next_year` is equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**

Explanation: The code `current_year = next_year` simply assigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`. This does not change the relationship between `current_year` and `next_year` as defined in the initial state. Therefore, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, and `next_year` remains as per its definition: `next_year` is equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
