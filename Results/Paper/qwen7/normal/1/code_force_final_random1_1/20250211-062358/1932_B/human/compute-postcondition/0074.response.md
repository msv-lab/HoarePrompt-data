Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year - ai`, `next_year` is equal to `current_year + ai`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_year` to be `current_year + ai`. This means that `next_year` now holds the value of `current_year + ai`. The initial condition that `next_year` is either equal to `current_year + ai` if `current_year % ai == 0`, or equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` otherwise, no longer applies since the value of `next_year` has been directly set to `current_year + ai`. The only updated information is that `current_year` is now equal to `next_year - ai` because `next_year` was just set to `current_year + ai`.
