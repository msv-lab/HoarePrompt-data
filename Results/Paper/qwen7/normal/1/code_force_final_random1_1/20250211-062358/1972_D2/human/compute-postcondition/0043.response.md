The loop condition is `x * x <= n`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition must be true at the start of the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- `x` is 3
- `n` is at least 15
- `m` is at least 30
- `y` is 5
- `cnt` is 2

We need to ensure that `x * x <= n` is true at the start of the next iteration. Since `x` is currently 3, `x * x` is 9. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `n` must be at least 10 (since 9 <= 10 would satisfy the condition).

However, we know from the problem statement that `n` is at least 15. This means `n` already satisfies the condition `x * x <= n` because 9 <= 15 is true.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`x` is 3, `n` is at least 15, `m` is at least 30, `y` is 5, and `cnt` is 2**
