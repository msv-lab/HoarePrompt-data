Output State: **`x` is 3, `n` is at least 15, `m` is at least 30, `y` is 5, and `cnt` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Initially, `x` is 2. After executing this line of code, `x` becomes 3. The values of `n`, `m`, `y`, and `cnt` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `n` is still at least 15, `m` is still at least 30, `y` is still 5, and `cnt` is still 2.
