Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 3.

In natural language: The value of `t` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute all its iterations. This is because the loop can execute at least 3 times according to the given information, and each execution requires `t` to be greater than the current iteration number minus one. Therefore, for 3 iterations, `t` must be greater than or equal to 3.
