Output State: `t` must be greater than 2.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` must be greater than 2. This is because the loop can only execute as many times as the initial value of `t` allows, and since it can execute up to 3 times based on the given information, `t` must initially be at least 3 to allow for 3 iterations. However, since the condition after 3 iterations is that `t` must be greater than 1, and the loop can execute fully only if `t` is greater than 2 (as it executes `t` times), we conclude that `t` must be greater than 2 for the loop to complete all its iterations.
