Output State: `x` is 1, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 20, `y` is 5, and `cnt` is 2.

To understand this output state, let's break down the loop conditions and the changes in variables:

1. The loop continues as long as `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
2. In each iteration, if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

From the given information:
- After the first iteration (`y = 2`), `cnt` is 1.
- After the second iteration (`y = 3`), `cnt` is 2.
- After the third iteration (`y = 4`), `cnt` remains 2 because `math.gcd(1, 4) != 1`.

For the fourth iteration to occur, `y` would need to be 5. At this point, the condition `math.gcd(1, 5) == 1` is satisfied, so `cnt` will increment by `min(n / ((1 + 5) * 1), m // ((1 + 5) * 5))`. Given the constraints on `n` and `m` from previous iterations, we can deduce that `n` must be at least 5 and `m` must be at least 20 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, after all iterations, `x` remains 1, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 20, `y` is 5, and `cnt` is 2.
