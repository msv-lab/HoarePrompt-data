You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1()`. The function does not return any value but ensures that the variable `t` (representing the number of test cases) is at least 3 before proceeding with the iterations.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
   - It uses a nested loop where \(x\) iterates from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\) and \(y\) iterates from 1 to a value such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it adds the minimum of two values to the count:
     - \(n / ((x + y) \cdot x)\)
     - \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\)
   - The result is printed at the end of the function.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It processes each test case independently.

### Key Points to Verify

1. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The outer loop runs until \(x^2 \leq n\). This ensures \(x\) is within the range \([1, \sqrt{n}]\).
   - The inner loop runs until \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\). This ensures \(y\) is within the valid range for each \(x\).

2. **GCD Check**:
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\) correctly filters out pairs where \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of two values:
     - \(n / ((x + y) \cdot x)\)
     - \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\)
   - This calculation ensures that the count does not exceed the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic correctly iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the conditions.
   - The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the count remains an integer.

### Example Verification

Let's verify with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
  - No pairs satisfy the conditions, so the output is 0.

- **Test Case 2**: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
  - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\)
  - Output: 1

- **Test Case 4**: \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)
  - Valid pairs: \((2, 2)\), \((3, 6)\), \((4, 4)\), \((6, 3)\), \((6, 6)\), \((8, 8)\)
  - Output: 6

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
