The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1**
