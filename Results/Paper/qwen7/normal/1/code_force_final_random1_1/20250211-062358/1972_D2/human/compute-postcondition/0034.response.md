Output State: **`x` is 2, `n` is at least 8, `m` is at least 8, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is 1 since `math.gcd(x, y)` equals 1.**

The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables (`x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged. The condition for `cnt` being 1 because `math.gcd(x, y)` equals 1 still holds true, as `math.gcd(2, 3)` is indeed 1.
