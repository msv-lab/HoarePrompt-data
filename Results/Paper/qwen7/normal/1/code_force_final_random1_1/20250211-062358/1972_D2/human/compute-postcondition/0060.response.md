Output State: `x` is 3, `n` is exactly 19, `m` is exactly 19, `y` is 4, and `cnt` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\). Given the initial conditions and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that:

- After the first iteration, \(x = 3\), \(y = 2\), and \(cnt = 1\).
- After the second iteration, \(x = 3\), \(y = 3\), and \(cnt = 1\).
- After the third iteration, \(x = 3\), \(y = 4\), and \(cnt\) remains 1 because \(\mathgcd(3, 4) \neq 1\).

Since \(x\) remains 3 throughout the iterations and the conditions \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\) are no longer satisfied with the current values of \(x\) and \(y\), the loop will terminate. Therefore, the final values are \(x = 3\), \(y = 4\), \(n = 19\), \(m = 19\), and \(cnt = 1\).
