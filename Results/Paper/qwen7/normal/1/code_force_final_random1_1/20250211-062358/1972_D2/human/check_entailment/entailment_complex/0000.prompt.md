Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and n and m are within the constraints specified in the problem description.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 5, `n` is 24, `m` is 24, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is 1.
    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break it down:
    #
    #- The loop continues as long as `x * x <= n`. Given that `x` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, we can determine the final value of `x` after all iterations.
    #- From the given information, we know that after 3 iterations, `x` is 4. Therefore, the loop will continue until `x` reaches 5 because the condition `x * x <= n` must still hold true.
    #- For `x = 5`, the loop will check the conditions with `y` starting from 1. However, since `n` is 24, `(x + y) * x = 6 * 5 = 30` which is greater than `n`, so `y` will not increment beyond its initial value of 1. This means `y` remains 3.
    #- Similarly, for `m = 24`, `(x + y) * y = 8 * 3 = 24` which is equal to `m`, but any further increment in `y` would make `(x + y) * y > m`, so `y` remains 3.
    #- The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` holds true for `x = 5` and `y = 3` since their greatest common divisor is 1. However, the value of `cnt` does not change because the condition `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` evaluates to 0 due to `(x + y) * x > n` and `(x + y) * y > m`.
    #- Thus, after all iterations, `x` becomes 5, `n` remains 24, `m` remains 24, `y` becomes 3, and `cnt` remains 1.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \). It then iterates over possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) to count pairs \((x, y)\) such that both \( x \) and \( y \) are coprime, and the product \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\). Finally, it prints the total count of such pairs.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 3.
    #
    #In natural language: The value of `t` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute all its iterations. This is because the loop can execute at least 3 times according to the given information, and each execution requires `t` to be greater than the current iteration number minus one. Therefore, for 3 iterations, `t` must be greater than or equal to 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1()`. The function does not return any value but ensures that the variable `t` (representing the number of test cases) is at least 3 before proceeding with the iterations.
