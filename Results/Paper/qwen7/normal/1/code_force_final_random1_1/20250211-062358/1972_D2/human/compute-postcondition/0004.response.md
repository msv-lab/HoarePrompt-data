Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no information about what `func_1()` does is provided, the only thing we can determine is that it may have modified the value of `t`. However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_1()`, we cannot specify any changes to `t`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 is still valid, but the exact value of `t` after the function call remains unknown.
