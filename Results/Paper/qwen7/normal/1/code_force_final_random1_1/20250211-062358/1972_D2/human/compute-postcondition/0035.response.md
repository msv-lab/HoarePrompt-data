To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is:
\[
(x + y) \cdot x \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (x + y) \cdot y \leq m
\]

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- \( x = 2 \)
- \( n \) is at least 8
- \( m \) is at least 8
- \( y = 3 \)
- \( cnt = 1 \) (though this is not directly relevant to the loop condition)

Let's evaluate the loop condition with these values:
\[
(2 + 3) \cdot 2 \leq n \quad \Rightarrow \quad 5 \cdot 2 \leq n \quad \Rightarrow \quad 10 \leq n
\]
\[
(2 + 3) \cdot 3 \leq m \quad \Rightarrow \quad 5 \cdot 3 \leq m \quad \Rightarrow \quad 15 \leq m
\]

For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
1. \( 10 \leq n \)
2. \( 15 \leq m \)

Since \( n \) is already at least 8, the first condition \( 10 \leq n \) is satisfied as long as \( n \) remains at least 10.

Similarly, since \( m \) is already at least 8, the second condition \( 15 \leq m \) is satisfied as long as \( m \) remains at least 15.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that:
- \( n \) is at least 10
- \( m \) is at least 15

So, the states that need to be adjusted are \( n \) and \( m \).

State: **`x` is 2, `n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is 1**
