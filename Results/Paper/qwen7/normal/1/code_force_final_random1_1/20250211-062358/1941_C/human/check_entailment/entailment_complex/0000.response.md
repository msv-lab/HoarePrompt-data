Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function simply counts the total occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" across all test cases and prints the sum of these counts. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of characters to remove from each string to make it beautiful, not the total count of "map" and "pie" across all strings.

The function should process each string individually and calculate the minimum deletions needed to remove either "map" or "pie" from the string. The current implementation does not achieve this and instead provides an incorrect solution.

Correctness: **False**
