Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum. This approach does not guarantee that the minimum number of deletions is performed. For example, consider the input "mappppie":

- The program would count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in a total of 2 deletions.
- However, the optimal solution would be to delete the first "m" and the last "e" to make the string "appppi", which is beautiful with only 2 deletions but does not remove all instances of "map" and "pie".

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
