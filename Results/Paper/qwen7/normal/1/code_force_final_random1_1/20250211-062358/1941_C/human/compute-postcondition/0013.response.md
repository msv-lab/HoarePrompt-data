Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. This means that the loop will run for as many times as the integer input by the user.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**: The only variables directly involved in the loop head are the ones used within the `range()` function, which is `int(input())`. However, since `_` is used as the iterator variable (which is common practice when the value of the iterator is not needed), it does not affect the state of the program. The key variable here is the input integer itself, which controls the number of iterations.

3. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a new string input by the user.
   - `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
   - `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

4. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, the input integer `a` must be decremented by 1 because each iteration consumes one unit of the input integer. Therefore, `a` should be `a - 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop is controlled by the input integer `a`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is an input integer decreased by 1, `s` is a new string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`**.
