Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`. The other variables (`a`, `s`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
