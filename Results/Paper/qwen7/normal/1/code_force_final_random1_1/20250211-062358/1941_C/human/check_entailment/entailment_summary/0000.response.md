Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program counts the total occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in each input string `s` but does not consider the context of the entire string. Specifically, the program simply adds the counts of "map" and "pie" without considering whether these substrings overlap or if they can be removed to make the string beautiful with minimal deletions.

For example, in the input "mmapnapie", the program would count both "map" and "pie", resulting in a deletion count of 2. However, the correct solution would only require deleting 2 characters ("m" and "e") to make the string "mmapnapie" beautiful.

The program should instead identify the minimum number of deletions required to remove all instances of "map" and "pie" such that no part of these substrings remains in the string. This requires a more complex logic to handle overlapping and non-overlapping instances of "map" and "pie".

Correctness: **False**
