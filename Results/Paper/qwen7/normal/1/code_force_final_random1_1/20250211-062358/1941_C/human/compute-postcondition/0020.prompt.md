Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = int(input())
    s = input()
    x = s.count('map')
    y = s.count('pie')
    print(x + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive; `s` is a string input by the user; `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`; `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, and `y` is updated to the count of 'pie' in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `y` is updated to the count of 'pie' in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
