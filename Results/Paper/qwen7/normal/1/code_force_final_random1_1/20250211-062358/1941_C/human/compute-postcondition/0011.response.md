Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input integer.
- `s` is a new string input by the user.
- `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
- `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
- `y` is updated to the count of 'pie' in `s`.

The `print(x + y)` statement will add the number of occurrences of 'map' (`x`) and 'pie' (`y`) in the string `s` and print the result.

Since the exact string `s` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`. However, we know that `y` is updated to the count of 'pie' in `s`, so `y` will be the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the number of times 'map' appears in `s` and the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s and y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s)**
