Output: **No**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, and `n` and `m` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively. These values are then converted to integers. However, the print statement simply outputs the string 'No', and does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, the output is simply 'No'.
