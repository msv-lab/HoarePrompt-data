Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split, and `m` is less than or equal to `n`, but `m` is not equal to `n - 1`. Additionally, either `m` is not even or `n` is not even, and `(m % 2 == 0 or n % 2 == 0)`.
