Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input split.
- `m` is the second integer from the input split.

The code snippet simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Since no values for `n` and `m` are used in the print statement, and the string `'Yes'` is directly printed, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
