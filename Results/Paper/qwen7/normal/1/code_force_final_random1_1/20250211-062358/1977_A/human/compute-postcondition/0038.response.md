Output: **Yes**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split, and `m` is the second integer from the input split. The print statement simply outputs the string 'Yes', and does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, the output will be the string 'Yes'.
