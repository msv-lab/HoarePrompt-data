Output: **No**

Explanation: 
- The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- `n` and `m` are the first and second integers from the input split, respectively, and they are converted to integers.
- The `print('No')` statement directly prints the string 'No' without using any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`, and it simply prints the string 'No', the output is **No**.
