Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value of `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer from the first split.
   - `m` is an input integer from the second split.
   - If `n` equals `m`, then `n` equals `m`.
   - Otherwise, `m` is greater than `n` or `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - If `m` equals `n - 1`, then `m` is `n - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `m` is less than or equal to `n` but not equal to `n - 1`, and either both `m` and `n` are even, or both `m` and `n` are odd.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `t` remains unchanged.

5. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` remains the same (an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive).
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` remains the same (input integer from the first split).
   - `m` remains the same (input integer from the second split).

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split**.
