Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` being equal to the total number of test cases specified by `t`. For each test case, the variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are the integers obtained from the corresponding input. The output of each iteration is determined based on the conditions provided within the loop:

- If `B * 2 < C`, the output is `A * B`.
- If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, the output is `int(A * C / 2)`.
- If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, the output is `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2`.

All other variables outside the loop, including `t`, remain unchanged from their initial or previous states after the loop completes.
