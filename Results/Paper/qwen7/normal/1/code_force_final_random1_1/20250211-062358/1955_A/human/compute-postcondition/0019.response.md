Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value does not affect the print statement directly.
- `i` is 1. This value also does not affect the print statement directly.
- `A` is an integer obtained from the first input value.
- `B` is an integer obtained from the second input value.
- `C` is an integer obtained from the third input value.

The print statement is `print(int(A * C / 2))`.

This statement calculates the integer division of the product of `A` and `C` by 2 and then prints it.

Since `A` and `C` are integers obtained from inputs, let's denote them as `A_input` and `C_input` respectively. The expression `int(A * C / 2)` will compute the integer division of the product of `A_input` and `C_input` by 2.

Therefore, the output will be the integer result of this calculation.

Output: **int(A_input * C_input / 2)**
