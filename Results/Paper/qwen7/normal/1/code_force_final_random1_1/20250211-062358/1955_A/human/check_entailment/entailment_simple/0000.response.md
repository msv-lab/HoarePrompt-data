Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts respectively.
3. The logic inside the loop checks the following conditions:
   - If the price of two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (`a * 2`), it's cheaper to buy individual yogurts at the regular price. Hence, the cost is calculated as `A * B` (where `A` is `n` and `B` is `a`).
   - If the price of two yogurts (`b`) is greater than or equal to twice the price of one yogurt (`a * 2`), and the number of yogurts `A` is even, it's cheaper to buy pairs of yogurts at the promotion price. Hence, the cost is calculated as `int(A * C / 2)` (where `A` is `n` and `C` is `b`).
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, it's cheaper to buy pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price. Hence, the cost is calculated as `X * C + B`, where `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2 (`A // 2`).

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for each test case based on the conditions provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
