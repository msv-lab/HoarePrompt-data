Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `t - 1`. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are the last set of values read from the input during the final iteration of the loop. Depending on the conditions within the loop, either `A * B`, `int(A * C / 2)`, or `X * C + B` (where `X = A // 2`) was printed during each iteration. The variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

In summary, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be `t - 1`, and the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` will be those provided by the last input. The output of each iteration will be determined based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
