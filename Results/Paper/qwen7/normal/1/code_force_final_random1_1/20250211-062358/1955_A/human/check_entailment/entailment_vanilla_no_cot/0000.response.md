Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func()` correctly calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts considering both the regular price and the promotion price. Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Loop through Test Cases**: The function iterates over the number of test cases specified by the user.
2. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` which represent the number of yogurts, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts, respectively.
3. **Price Comparison**:
   - If the price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price for one yogurt (`B * 2`), it means it's cheaper to buy in pairs. In this case, the function directly prints `A * B`.
   - If `C` is greater than or equal to `B * 2`, the function then checks if the total number of yogurts `A` is even.
     - If `A` is even, it divides the yogurts into pairs and calculates the total cost as `int(A * C / 2)`.
     - If `A` is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible and then buys the remaining yogurt at the regular price. The cost calculation is `X * C + B` where `X` is the number of pairs (`A // 2`).

This logic ensures that the function considers all possible scenarios to find the minimum cost efficiently. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
