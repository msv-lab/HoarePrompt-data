Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and B * 2 is greater than or equal to C, and A is an odd integer; `X` is `A` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The code `X = A // 2` assigns the value of `A` divided by 2 (using integer division) to the variable `X`. Since `A` is an odd integer, `X` will be the integer part of `A / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
