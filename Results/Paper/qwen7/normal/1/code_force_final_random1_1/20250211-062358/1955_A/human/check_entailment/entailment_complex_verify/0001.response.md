### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step using the provided annotations and the example test cases.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` in the first line.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the price of two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (`2*a`).
     - If `2*a > b`, it means buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually.
     - If `2*a <= b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A` (number of yogurts) is even, the program calculates the total cost by dividing `A` by 2 and multiplying by `C` (promotion price for two yogurts).

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A` is odd, the program calculates the cost by:
     - Buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible (using `X = A // 2`), which costs `X * C`.
     - Buying the remaining one yogurt at the individual price (`B`).

#### Test Cases Analysis:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `2 * 5 = 10` (individual price for 2 yogurts)
     - `9` (promotion price for 2 yogurts)
     - Since `9 < 10`, the minimum cost is `9`.
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `3 * 5 = 15` (individual price for 3 yogurts)
     - `9 * 1 + 9 = 18` (buy 1 pair at promotion and 1 individually)
     - `9 * 2 + 5 = 23` (buy 2 pairs at promotion and 1 individually)
     - The minimum cost is `15`.
   - Output: `14` (Incorrect, should be `15`)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `3 * 5 = 15` (individual price for 3 yogurts)
     - `11 * 1 + 11 = 22` (buy 1 pair at promotion and 1 individually)
     - `11 * 2 + 5 = 27` (buy 2 pairs at promotion and 1 individually)
     - The minimum cost is `15`.
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `4 * 5 = 20` (individual price for 4 yogurts)
     - `11 * 2 = 22` (buy 2 pairs at promotion)
     - The minimum cost is `20`.
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

#### Detailed Breakdown:

- **Test Case 2:**
  - The program logic for odd numbers of yogurts seems to be incorrect. Specifically, the line `print(X * C + B)` should ensure that the remaining yogurt is bought at the individual price `B` when `A` is odd.
  - The correct logic should be:
    ```python
    if A % 2 == 0:
        print(int(A * C / 2))
    else:
        X = A // 2
        print(X * C + B)
    ```
  - In the given code, the line `print(int(A * C / 2))` is used instead of `print(X * C + B)` when `A` is odd, leading to incorrect results.

#### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not handle the case when the number of yogurts `A` is odd correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
