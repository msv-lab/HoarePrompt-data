Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts).

2. **Conditions for Calculation**:
   - If the price of two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (`2*a`), it is cheaper to buy them individually at the regular price (`a`). Hence, the cost is `A * B`.
   - If the price of two yogurts (`b`) is greater than or equal to twice the price of one yogurt (`2*a`), it is cheaper to buy them in pairs. 
     - If the number of yogurts (`A`) is even, the cost is `int(A * C / 2)`.
     - If the number of yogurts (`A`) is odd, the cost is calculated by buying as many pairs as possible (`X = A // 2`) and then adding the cost of the remaining yogurt (`B`).

3. **Output**: The program correctly prints the minimum cost for each test case based on the above conditions.

4. **Loop and Test Cases**: The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case independently, and prints the result for each case.

Given that the logic implemented matches the problem requirements and the conditions are handled correctly, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
