Output State: All elements in the `numbers` list have been processed by the function `distribute_number(num)`, and the value of `num` continues to be updated to the next element in the `numbers` list after each call to `distribute_number(num)`. The functions `distribute_number` have been called `n` times, where `n` is the length of the `numbers` list. The variables `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` contain subsets of the original `numbers` list, and `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` represent the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, respectively. The values of `na`, `nb`, and `nc` reflect the sizes of these groups, maintaining the condition `na + nb + nc = n`.
