Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial Information
- The function `distribute_number(num)` has been called with the argument `num`, and the value of `num` remains unchanged.
- The for loop iterates over the `numbers` list, with `num` as the loop variable.

### Loop Head Analysis
- The loop head is `for num in numbers:`.
- The only variable in the loop head is `num`.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- The value of `num` remains unchanged from the previous call to `distribute_number(num)`.
- The loop continues to iterate over the `numbers` list.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be set to the next element in the `numbers` list.
- Since the value of `num` remains unchanged, it means that the loop has already processed the current `num` and moved to the next element in the list.

### Adjusting the State
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is `num`, which should now point to the next element in the `numbers` list.
- The value of `num` remains the same as it was before the previous iteration, but the context implies that it is moving to the next element.

### Final State
- The state at the start of the next iteration will be the same as the previous iteration, except for the fact that `num` is now set to the next element in the `numbers` list.

### Answer
State: **The function `distribute_number(num)` has been called with the argument `num`, and the value of `num` remains unchanged. The loop is about to process the next element in the `numbers` list.** 

However, since we need to specify the exact state in the format requested:

State: **The function `distribute_number(num)` has been called with the argument `num`, and the value of `num` remains unchanged. `num` is now set to the next element in the `numbers` list.**
