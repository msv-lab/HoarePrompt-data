You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, na, nb, and nc are integers such that 1 ≤ na, nb, nc ≤ n-2 and na + nb + nc = n. numbers is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9 for each x_i in numbers.
def func_2(n, na, nb, nc, numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    group_a, group_b, group_c = [], [], []
    sum_a, sum_b, sum_c = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
        
    #State: Output State: All elements in the `numbers` list have been processed by the function `distribute_number(num)`, and the value of `num` continues to be updated to the next element in the `numbers` list after each call to `distribute_number(num)`. The functions `distribute_number` have been called `n` times, where `n` is the length of the `numbers` list. The variables `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` contain subsets of the original `numbers` list, and `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` represent the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, respectively. The values of `na`, `nb`, and `nc` reflect the sizes of these groups, maintaining the condition `na + nb + nc = n`.
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) :
        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: n (an integer between 3 and 200,000), na, nb, and nc (integers between 1 and n-2 such that na + nb + nc = n), and a list of n positive integers numbers. It returns 'YES' along with three groups of indices (group_a, group_b, group_c) if it's possible to divide the list into three groups with sizes na, nb, and nc respectively. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
