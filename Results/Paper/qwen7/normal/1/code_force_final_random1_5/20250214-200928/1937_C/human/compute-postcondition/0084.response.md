To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. The print statement is: `print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)`
2. We need to identify the values of `k`, `best`, and `i`.

However, the initial state does not provide explicit values for `k`, `best`, and `i`. Therefore, we need to describe the values of these variables in a general form based on typical usage in such a context.

- `k`: This could be any integer value depending on the context.
- `best`: This could be any value depending on the context, often it might be a score, a count, or a best value found so far.
- `i`: This could also be any integer value, typically representing an index or iteration number.

Given this, the print statement will output a string followed by the values of `k`, `best`, and `i`.

Output: **'? [k] [best] [k] [i]' (where [k] is the value of k, [best] is the value of best, and [i] is the value of i)**
