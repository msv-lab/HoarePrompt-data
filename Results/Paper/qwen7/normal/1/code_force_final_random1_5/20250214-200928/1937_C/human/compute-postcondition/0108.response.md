Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `best` is 5
   - `i` is 3
   - `k` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 3
   - `res` is an input string (current value is the input from the user, if `res` equals '<', `k` is set to 3)

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop variable `i` starts from 2 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 4.
- `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 3.

The state of `best`, `k`, and `res` does not change based on the loop head, so they remain as they are.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`best` is 5, `i` is 4, `k` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `res` is an input string**.
