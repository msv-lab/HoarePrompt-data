Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is explicitly given as 0.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 6 but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `k` is explicitly given as 5.
- `res` remains unchanged if it equals '<', but this does not affect the print statement since `res` is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Substituting the known values:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` is 5.
- `best` is 0.
- `k` is again 5.
- `i` is 1.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 5 0 5 1'**
