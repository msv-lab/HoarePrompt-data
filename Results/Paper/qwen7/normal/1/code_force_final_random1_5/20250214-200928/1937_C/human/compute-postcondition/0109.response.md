Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is 5
- `i` is 4
- `k` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `res` is an input string

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown of what each argument in the `print` function represents:
- `'?'`: A string literal.
- `0`: An integer literal.
- `k`: The value of `k` is 3.
- `0`: Another integer literal.
- `i`: The value of `i` is 4.

So, when the `print` statement is executed, it will print the string `'?'` followed by the integers `0`, `3`, `0`, and `4`.

Output: **'? 0 3 0 4'**
