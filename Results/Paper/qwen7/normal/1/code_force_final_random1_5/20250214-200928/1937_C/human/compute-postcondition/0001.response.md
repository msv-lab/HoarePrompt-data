Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state for `input()` providing valid integers for `n` and `t` remains unchanged for `t` since it is not mentioned or used in the given code snippet. Therefore, the only updated variable is `n`, which is now an integer obtained from the input.
