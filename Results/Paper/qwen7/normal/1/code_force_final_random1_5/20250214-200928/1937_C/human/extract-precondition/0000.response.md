Precondition: **None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem requires the function to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves finding a pair of indices i and j such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using at most 3n queries. The function must interact with an external entity to ask queries and receive responses. The variable n is an integer representing the size of the permutation, and t is an integer representing the number of test cases.**
