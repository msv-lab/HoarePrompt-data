Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `best` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`
   - `i` is 2
   - `k` is 1
   - `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is an input string, if `res` equals '<'

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - To continue the loop, `i` must be incremented to 3 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time).
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must remain greater than or equal to its original value.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to its original value.
   - `best`, `k`, and `res` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `best` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is 3, `k` is 1, `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is an input string, if `res` equals '<'**
