Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is explicitly given as 4.
- `n` is stated to be greater than or equal to 5, but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement.
- `i` is explicitly given as 5.
- `k` is explicitly given as 1.
- `res` is an input string, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Breaking down the print statement:
- The first argument is a string `'?'`.
- The second argument is `0`.
- The third argument is `k`, which is explicitly given as 1.
- The fourth argument is `0`.
- The fifth argument is `i`, which is explicitly given as 5.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 0 1 0 5'**
