The function processes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) by first finding the maximum index in the range from 0 to n-1 using a custom comparison function `func_1`. It then identifies the minimum index among those that satisfy a specific condition relative to the maximum index. Finally, it calls another function `func_2` with the identified maximum and minimum indices.
