Output: **'? 0 3 0 3'**

Explanation:
- `n` is greater than 3, but its exact value is not needed since it does not appear in the print statement.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `k` is explicitly given as 3.
- `res` is an input string, but its value is not needed since it does not appear in the print statement.

Therefore, the print statement will output the formatted string `'? 0 3 0 3'`.
