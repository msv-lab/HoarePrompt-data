Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `res` is an input string.
- `i` is `i + 1`, but since `i` is not explicitly initialized, we cannot determine its exact value. However, it is implied that `i` is being incremented by 1.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Since `k` and `best` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, they will be printed as they are.

The output will be a string with placeholders for `k` and `best`, along with the incremented value of `i`.

Output: **'? [k] [best] [k] [i]' (where [k] and [best] are unknown values and [i] is the incremented value of the original i)**
