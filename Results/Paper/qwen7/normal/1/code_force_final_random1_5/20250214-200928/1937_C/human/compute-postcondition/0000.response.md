Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder used to iterate over the range of input values.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are more test cases to process. The loop will continue until the input function `input()` returns an empty string or reaches the end of the input stream.

3. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as "None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature." However, within the loop, the variables `n` and `t` will be defined based on the input.

4. **Adjust the States**: For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the input mechanism (`input()`) provides valid data for the loop to process. Specifically, the loop will run as long as there are test cases to handle, which means the input should provide valid integers for `n` and `t`.

Given this, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- The input mechanism should provide valid integers for `n` and `t` in each test case.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more test cases, so the input should ensure that the loop can process at least one test case.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the input mechanism provides valid data for the loop to process.

**State:**
- **`input()` must provide valid integers for `n` and `t` in each test case**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`input()` must provide valid integers for `n` and `t` in each test case**.
