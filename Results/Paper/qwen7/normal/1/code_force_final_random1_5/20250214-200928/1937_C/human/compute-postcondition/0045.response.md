Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is explicitly stated to be 4.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 4.
- `k` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `res` is described as an input string but its value is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('!', k, best, flush=True)
```

This will print the string `'!'` followed by the value of `k`, then the value of `best`. Since `k` is 1 and `best` is 4, the output will be:
Output: **! 1 4**
