Output: **'? 0 2 0 3'**

Explanation:
- `?` is a literal character that is printed as is.
- `0` is a literal integer that is printed as is.
- `k` is defined as 2, so it will be printed as `2`.
- `0` is a literal integer that is printed as is.
- `i` is defined as 3, so it will be printed as `3`.

The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is flushed immediately, but it does not change the content of what is printed. Therefore, the output will be `? 0 2 0 3`.
