Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `res` is an input string, `k` is now equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is now 3 (equal to `i`), and `res` remains an input string.
