Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is equal to '<', `k` is 2**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` is now 2, while `n`, `i`, and `res` retain their original values and conditions.
