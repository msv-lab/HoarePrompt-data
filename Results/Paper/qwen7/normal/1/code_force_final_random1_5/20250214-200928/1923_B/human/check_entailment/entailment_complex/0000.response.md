### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the process of firing bullets at monsters and checking if the player can survive.
   - It sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distances from the player (point 0).
   - It iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the monsters until their health reaches zero or they are too close to the player.
   - The function returns `True` if the player can survive and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs (`n`, `k`, `a`, `x`) and calls `func_1` with these inputs.
   - It prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, indicating the player can survive, and 'NO' otherwise.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it correctly simulates the process of firing bullets and checks if the player can survive based on the logic implemented in `func_1`.
   - The output is consistent with the problem statement, printing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
