The loop condition in this case is `pos != len(sorted_indices)`. This means the loop will continue executing as long as `pos` is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `distance` is increased by 1.
- `rest` is not zero.
- `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `pos != len(sorted_indices)` must still be true. Therefore, `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices` after the current iteration.

Given the information, no adjustments are needed for `rest` since the loop will continue as long as `rest` is not zero, and we are not given any specific condition about `rest` changing in the loop body. Similarly, `distance` remains unchanged as it is only incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, and we are not told it changes inside the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `pos` to ensure it is less than the length of `sorted_indices` for the loop to continue.

State: **`distance` is increased by 1, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`**
