### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function checks if it is possible to kill all monsters before any of them reach the player's position (point 0).
- **Key Logic**:
  - It sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player.
  - It iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the closest monsters.
  - It ensures that no monster reaches the player's position before all monsters are killed.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function processes multiple test cases.
- **Key Logic**:
  - It reads the number of test cases (`t`).
  - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters (`n`), the number of bullets per second (`k`), the health of each monster (`a`), and the initial positions of the monsters (`x`).
  - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints "YES" if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise "NO".

### Analysis of `func_1`:
1. **Sorting Monsters**: The function sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player. This ensures that the closest monsters are dealt with first.
2. **Firing Bullets**: The function iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the closest monsters until their health is zero or the player's bullets run out.
3. **Checking Distance**: The function checks if any monster reaches the player's position before all monsters are killed.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**: The function correctly reads the input for each test case.
2. **Calling `func_1`**: The function correctly calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
3. **Printing Output**: The function prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result of `func_1`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Test Case 1**: The provided example demonstrates that `func_1` correctly handles the scenario where the player can survive and kill all monsters.
- **Test Case 2**: The provided example also demonstrates that `func_1` correctly identifies when the player cannot survive.

Given the logic and the examples provided, both functions appear to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided functions correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: **True**
