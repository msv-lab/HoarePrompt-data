Output State: **`distance` is 0, `pos` is 2, the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now equal to `x[sorted_indices[pos]] - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `rest` is `rest - delta`, `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`**

Explanation: The code `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. Initially, `pos` is 1, so after executing the code, `pos` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
