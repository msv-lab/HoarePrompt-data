Output State: **`rest` is reduced by `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.**

Explanation: The variable `delta` is assigned the value of the minimum between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. Since `rest` is not zero and `pos` is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices`, these conditions remain true post-execution. The value of `rest` is reduced by the value assigned to `delta`.
