Output State: `t` must be equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, `n` is the last integer input converted to an integer obtained from the final iteration of the loop, `k` is the last integer input converted to an integer obtained from the final iteration of the loop, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the final input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())` for the last iteration, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the final input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())` for the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the total number of iterations (which is the value it was set to at the start), `n` and `k` will be the values they were given in the last iteration of the loop, and `a` and `x` will be the lists of integers provided as inputs in the last iteration of the loop.
