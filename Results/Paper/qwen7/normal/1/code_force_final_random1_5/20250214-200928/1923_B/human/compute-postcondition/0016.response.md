Output State: `t` must be equal to 3, `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer from the third iteration, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer from the third iteration, `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces from the third iteration, `x` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces from the third iteration.

This means after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be 3, indicating the loop ran exactly 3 times. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` will correspond to the inputs provided during the last (third) iteration of the loop.
