Output State: **`rest` is `rest - delta - delta`, `distance` is increased by 2, `pos` is equal to `pos + 1`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]])`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]]` is decreased by `delta`, `pos` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `pos`.
