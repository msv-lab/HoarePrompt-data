Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `t` and `a` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
