Output State: `distance` is 0, `pos` is either the last index of `sorted_indices` or the second last index, the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `rest` is 0.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `rest` will be 0 because the loop continues to run as long as `rest` is not 0. The variable `pos` will be either the last index of `sorted_indices` or the second last index, depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was reduced to 0 during the last iteration. In both cases, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` will be 0, and `distance` remains unchanged at 0.
