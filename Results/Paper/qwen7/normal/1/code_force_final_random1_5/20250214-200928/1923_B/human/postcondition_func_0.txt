The function accepts three parameters: a list of non-negative integers `a`, a list of integers `x`, and a non-negative integer `k`. The length of `a` and `x` is `n`, and the values in `x` are sorted in strictly increasing order with no zeros. The function attempts to reduce the elements in list `a` by firing bullets according to the positions in list `x` and the rate specified by `k`. If at any point, the absolute position in `x` matches the current distance, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, after up to 10 iterations, the function returns `True`.
