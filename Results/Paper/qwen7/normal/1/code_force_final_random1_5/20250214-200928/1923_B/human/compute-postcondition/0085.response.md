Let's analyze the given loop and the current state step by step.

### Given Loop:
```python
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `rest` is equal to `rest - delta`
- `distance` is increased by 2
- `pos` is equal to `pos + 1`
- `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]])`
- `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to 0
- `a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]]` is decreased by `delta`
- `delta` is now `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`
- `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices) - 2`
- `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `rest != 0` and `pos != len(sorted_indices)`.

2. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `rest`: This variable is checked against `0` in the loop condition.
   - `pos`: This variable is checked against `len(sorted_indices)` in the loop condition.

3. **Current Values**:
   - `rest` is `rest - delta` (decreased from the previous value).
   - `pos` is `pos + 1` (increased from the previous value).

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to continue, `rest` must not be `0`.
   - For the loop to continue, `pos` must not be equal to `len(sorted_indices)`.

5. **Determining the Adjustments**:
   - Since `rest` is `rest - delta`, it must be non-zero for the loop to continue. Therefore, `rest` must be greater than `0`.
   - Since `pos` is `pos + 1`, it must be less than `len(sorted_indices)` for the loop to continue. Therefore, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices) - 1`.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `rest` must be greater than `0`.
- `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices) - 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`rest` must be greater than 0, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices) - 1`**
