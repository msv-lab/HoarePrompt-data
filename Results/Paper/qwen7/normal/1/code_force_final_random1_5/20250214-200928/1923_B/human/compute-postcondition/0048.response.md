Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The loop condition is `while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):`
- After the previous iteration:
  - `rest` is now equal to `rest - 2*delta`
  - `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`
  - `pos` is increased by 1
  - `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to 0

### Loop Head Variables
- The loop head variables are `rest` and `pos`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution
- The loop continues as long as `rest != 0` and `pos != len(sorted_indices)`.

### Analysis
1. **Condition `rest != 0`:**
   - For the loop to continue, `rest` must not be zero. Since `rest` is updated to `rest - 2*delta` in each iteration, we need to ensure that `rest` is still greater than 0 after the update.
   
2. **Condition `pos != len(sorted_indices)`:**
   - For the loop to continue, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`. Since `pos` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to ensure that `pos` is still less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

### Adjusting States
- We need to ensure that both conditions are met for the next iteration of the loop.
- Specifically, we need to ensure that `rest` is still greater than 0 and `pos` is still less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

### Conclusion
- The state at the end of the previous iteration already includes `rest` being updated to `rest - 2*delta` and `pos` being incremented by 1.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `rest` is still greater than 0 and `pos` is still less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

### Final State
State: **`rest` must be greater than 0, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`**
