Output State: **`rest` is now equal to `rest - delta`, `delta` remains unchanged, and `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`**.

Explanation: The code `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. The value of `delta` remains the same as it was before the operation. The condition that `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)` is still valid after the code execution.
