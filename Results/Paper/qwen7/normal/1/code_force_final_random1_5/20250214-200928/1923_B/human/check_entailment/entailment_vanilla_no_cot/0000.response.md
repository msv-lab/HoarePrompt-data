Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Sorting and Index Handling**: The function `func_1` sorts indices based on the absolute distance from the origin (`abs(x[i])`). However, it doesn't correctly handle the logic to ensure that all monsters are killed before they reach the player's position. Specifically, the way it processes the bullets and checks distances is flawed.

2. **Logic Flaws**: The function `func_1` does not properly simulate the game's rules. It does not account for the fact that bullets can be fired at multiple monsters simultaneously and that monsters move towards the player after every second. The function also does not correctly handle the scenario where a monster can be killed by multiple bullets fired in the same second.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The function incorrectly uses a single variable `distance` to track the movement of monsters, which does not reflect the actual game mechanics. Monsters should be processed individually based on their initial positions and speeds.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when a monster is very close to the player and needs to be killed immediately, or when there are multiple monsters that need to be killed in the same second.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to simulate the game step-by-step, ensuring that you can kill all monsters before they reach the player's position. This involves firing bullets optimally and moving monsters accordingly in each second.
