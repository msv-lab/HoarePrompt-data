Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1

    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of the monsters, x is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, and k is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets you can fire per second. The length of a and x is n, and the values in x are sorted in strictly increasing order and none of them are zero.
def func_1(a, x, k):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    distance = 0
    pos = 0
    while pos != len(sorted_indices):
        if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
            return False
        
        rest = k
        
        while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
            delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
            rest -= delta

            if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
                pos += 1
        
        distance += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `distance` is increased by a total of 10 units (2 units per iteration for the first 5 iterations, and 1 unit per iteration for the next 5 iterations), `pos` is either equal to `len(sorted_indices)` or one less than it (depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` became zero before `rest` reached 0), and each element in `a` that was targeted by the loop has been decremented by its respective `delta` value. If an element in `a` was reduced to zero, it was skipped in subsequent iterations. The exact values of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` will depend on how many times each index was decremented during the loop's execution. The `rest` variable will be reduced to 0 after all iterations, and no further changes will occur to `distance` or `pos` beyond the 10th iteration.
    return True
    #The program returns True

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; x is a list of n integers where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, `n` is the last integer input converted to an integer obtained from the final iteration of the loop, `k` is the last integer input converted to an integer obtained from the final iteration of the loop, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the final input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())` for the last iteration, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the final input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())` for the last iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the total number of iterations (which is the value it was set to at the start), `n` and `k` will be the values they were given in the last iteration of the loop, and `a` and `x` will be the lists of integers provided as inputs in the last iteration of the loop.
