Output State: **`rest` is now equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `pos` is unchanged, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `delta` from `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. Given that `delta` is defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. Additionally, since `rest` was previously equal to `rest - delta`, and `delta` is now subtracted from `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `rest` is further reduced by `delta`, making it equal to `rest - 2*delta`. The value of `pos` remains unchanged.
