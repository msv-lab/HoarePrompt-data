Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest` - `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `delta` remains unchanged, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices) - 1`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now equal to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Explanation: The value of `delta` is set to the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. This means `delta` is updated to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Specifically, `rest` is reduced by `delta`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is also reduced by `delta`.
