Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into a list of strings using spaces, converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and assigns the resulting list of integers to `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
