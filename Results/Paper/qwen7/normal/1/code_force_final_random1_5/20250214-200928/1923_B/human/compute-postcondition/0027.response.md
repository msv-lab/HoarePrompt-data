Output State: **`distance` is 0, `pos` is either 1 or 2, the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `rest` is `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`**.

Explanation: The code `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` decreases the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` by `delta`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `distance` remains 0, `pos` is still either 1 or 2, the length of `sorted_indices` is still greater than 0, and `rest` is updated to `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.
