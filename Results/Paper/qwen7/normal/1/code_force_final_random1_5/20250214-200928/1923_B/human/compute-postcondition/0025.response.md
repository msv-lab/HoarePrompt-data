Output State: **`distance` is 0, `pos` is either 1 or 2, the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` to the variable `delta`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `delta` is updated to the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, while `distance`, `pos`, and `sorted_indices` retain their original states.
