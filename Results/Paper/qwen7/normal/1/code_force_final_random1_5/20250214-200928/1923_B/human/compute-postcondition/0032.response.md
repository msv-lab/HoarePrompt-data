Output State: `distance` is 0, `pos` is either the last index of `sorted_indices` or one less than the last index, the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, all elements in `a[sorted_indices]` are either 0 or decreased by their respective `delta` values, `rest` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `rest` will be 0 because the loop continues only as long as `rest` is not 0. The variable `pos` will be either the last index of `sorted_indices` or one less than the last index, depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was reduced to 0 during the last iteration. All elements in `a[sorted_indices]` that were decremented by `delta` will now be 0 or have been reduced accordingly. The `distance` remains 0 as it was not modified within the loop.
