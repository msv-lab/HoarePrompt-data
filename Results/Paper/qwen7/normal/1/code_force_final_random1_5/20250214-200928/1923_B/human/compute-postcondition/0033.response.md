Output State: **`distance` is 1, `pos` is either the last index of `sorted_indices` or one less than the last index, the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, all elements in `a[sorted_indices]` are either 0 or decreased by their respective `delta` values, `rest` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `distance += 1` increments the value of `distance` by 1. Initially, `distance` was 0, so after this operation, `distance` becomes 1. The other variables (`pos`, `sorted_indices`, `a[sorted_indices]`, and `rest`) remain unchanged from their initial states as no operations were performed on them within this line of code.
