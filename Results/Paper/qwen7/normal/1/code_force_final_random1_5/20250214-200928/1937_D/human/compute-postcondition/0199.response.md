Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is incremented by 1 if it was not 0.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `r` is decreased by 1.
- Depending on whether `l` is 0 or not:
  - If `l` is 0, then:
    - `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
    - `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
    - `a` and `b` retain their original values otherwise.
  - If `l` is not 0, then:
    - `a` is the value of `B[r]`.
    - `b` is the value of `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
    - `l - r - 1` is not greater than 0.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.

Given the conditions:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant for the entire loop.
- `r` will be decremented by 1.
- `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

### New States After Incrementing `i` and Decrementing `r`
- Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The new value of `r` will be `r - 1`.

### Final State
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` becomes `r - 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `l` remains the same.
- `a` and `b` retain their original values unless `l` is 0, but since `l` is not modified, we assume they retain their original values.

Thus, the updated states are:

**State:**
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `r` is `r - 1`.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `l` remains the same.
- `a` and `b` retain their original values.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` and `b` retain their original values**
