Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l]`.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by subtracting `B[r - l]` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
