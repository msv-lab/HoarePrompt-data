Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` to the current value of `a`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the expression simplifies to `- idx_A[l - 1] * l`. The values of `n` and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
