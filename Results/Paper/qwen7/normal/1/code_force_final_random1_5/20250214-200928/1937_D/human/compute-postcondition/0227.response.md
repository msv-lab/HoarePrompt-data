Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`**

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
