Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, and `a` and `b` retain their original values if `r` is not 0. If `r` is 0, then `a` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is updated to `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**
