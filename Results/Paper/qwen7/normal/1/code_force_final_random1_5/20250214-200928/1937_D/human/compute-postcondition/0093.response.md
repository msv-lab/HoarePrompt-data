Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is '>', and the condition `l < r` is still false; `b` is `A[l - 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions and characters at indices are also unaffected except for the new assignment to `b`.
