Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to its current value. Since `i` was previously 0, it is now increased by 1. The value of `r` is decreased by 1. The values of `a` and the condition for `b` remain unchanged from the initial state.
