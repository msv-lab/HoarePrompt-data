Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing `[0, 2, 0]`, `idx_A` is a list containing `[0, 2]`, and `i` is 2.**

The code `A.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the end of the list `A`. Initially, `A` contains `[0, 2]`. After appending `0`, `A` becomes `[0, 2, 0]`. The other variables (`s`, `idx_A`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
