Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a string of length `n`.
   - `A` is a list containing `[0, i]`.
   - `idx_A` is a list containing `[0]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that the character at index `i` in string `s` is `'>'.`

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `2`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, the character at index `i` (which will be index `2`) in string `s` must be `'>'.`
   - If the character at index `2` is `'>'.`, the loop will continue.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `2`.
   - `A` will be updated to `[0, 2]` because it contains `[0, i]`.
   - `idx_A` will be updated to `[0]` because it still contains `[0]`.

6. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `s` remains a string of length `n`.
   - `A` is now `[0, 2]`.
   - `idx_A` is still `[0]`.
   - `i` is now `2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing `[0, 2]`, `idx_A` is a list containing `[0]`, and `i` is 2.**
