Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be `n-1`, `i` will be `0`, `idx_B` will contain all indices where `s` has a '<' character from the last to the first, and `B` will be a list where each element is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each iteration.**

In more detail:
- The variable `j` starts at 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.
- For each `j`, `i` is set to `n - 1 - j`, which means `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0.
- If `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` and `B` are updated according to the given rules.
- `idx_B` will contain all indices of '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `B` will contain a series of values calculated based on the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the current value of `i`, multiplied by the length of `idx_B` at each step.
