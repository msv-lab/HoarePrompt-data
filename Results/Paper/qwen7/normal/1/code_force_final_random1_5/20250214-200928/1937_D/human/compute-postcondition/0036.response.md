Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**: The initial state given is:
   - `B` is an empty list.
   - `s` is a string of length `n`.
   - `A` is a list containing the cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in `s`.
   - `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of '>' characters in `s`.
   - `idx_B` is an empty list.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < n`. This means that `j` will take on integer values starting from 0 up to but not including `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop condition depends on `j` and `n`, we need to ensure these variables are set correctly for the loop to execute. Specifically:
   - `j` should start at 0.
   - `n` should be the length of the string `s`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`j` is 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`**
