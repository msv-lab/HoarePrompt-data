Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]`**.

The code `a = B[r]` assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `a`. Since `B[r]` does not have a specific value given in the initial state, `a` simply holds the value of `B[r]`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
