Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing `[0]`, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0.**

The code `A.append(x)` appends the value of `x` (which is 0) to the list `A`. Since `A` was initially an empty list, after appending `x`, `A` now contains `[0]`. The values of `s`, `idx_A`, and `i` remain unchanged.
