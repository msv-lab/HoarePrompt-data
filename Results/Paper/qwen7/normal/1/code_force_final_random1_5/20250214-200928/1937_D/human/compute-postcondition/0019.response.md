Output State: **`x` is 4, `s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing `[0, 2, 4]`, `idx_A` is a list containing `[0, 2]`, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `A.append(x)` appends the value of `x` (which is 4) to the list `A`. Initially, `A` contains `[0, 2]`. After appending 4, `A` becomes `[0, 2, 4]`. The values of `s`, `n`, `idx_A`, and `i` remain unchanged.
