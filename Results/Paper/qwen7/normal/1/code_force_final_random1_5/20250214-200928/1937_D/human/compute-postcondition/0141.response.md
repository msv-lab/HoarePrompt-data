Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
