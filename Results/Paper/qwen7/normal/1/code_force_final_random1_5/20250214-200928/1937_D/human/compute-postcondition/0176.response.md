Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the value of `B[r]`**.

This means that the variable `b` has been assigned the value of `B[r]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states: `i` is incremented by 1 if it was not 0, `n` must still be greater than 0, `r` has been decreased by 1, and `a` retains its previously calculated value.
