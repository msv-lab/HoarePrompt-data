Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is equal to `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is equal to `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. If `x >= 0`, then `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Since there is no else part, the value of `b` does not change if `x < 0`.
