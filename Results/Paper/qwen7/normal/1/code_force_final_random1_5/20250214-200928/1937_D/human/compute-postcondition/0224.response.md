Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is updated to be equal to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
