Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is '>', and the condition `l < r` is still false; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`**.

This means that the variable `a` is assigned the value of `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
