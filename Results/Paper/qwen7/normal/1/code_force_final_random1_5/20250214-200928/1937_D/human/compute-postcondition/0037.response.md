Output State: **`j` is 0; `i` is `n - 1 - j`**

Initially, `j` is 0 and `n` is the length of the string `s`. After executing the line `i = n - 1 - j`, `i` is assigned the value of `n - 1 - 0`, which simplifies to `n - 1`. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the output state is `j` is 0; `i` is `n - 1 - j`.
