Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - l]`**.

The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `B[r - l]` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
