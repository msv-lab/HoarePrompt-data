Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `b` is equal to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
