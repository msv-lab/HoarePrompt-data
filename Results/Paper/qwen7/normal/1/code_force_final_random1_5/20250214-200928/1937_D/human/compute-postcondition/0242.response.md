Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`: This means `i` has been incremented by 1.
- `r` is `r - 1`: This means `r` has been decremented by 1.
- `n` remains greater than 0: `n` is still a positive integer.
- `l` remains the same: `l` has not changed.
- `a` is equal to `B[r]`: Since `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is the element at index `r - 1` in the list `B`.
- `b` is equal to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`: Here, `idx_A[l - 1]` is the value of the element at index `l - 1` in the list `idx_A`. Therefore, `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to the current value of `b`.

Given these details, let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

- `a * 2`: This multiplies `a` by 2.
- `b * 2`: This multiplies `b` by 2.
- `(n - i)`: This subtracts the new value of `i` from `n`.

Putting it all together, the expression becomes:

\[ \text{output} = (a \times 2) + (b \times 2) + (n - i) \]

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **(2 * B[r - 1]) + (2 * (b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1))) + (n - (i + 1))**
