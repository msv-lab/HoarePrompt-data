Output State: **`a` is equal to `A[l]`, `i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. This formula does not depend on the value of `x`, so the condition `if x >= 0` does not affect the calculation of `b`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `n`, `r`) are updated according to their previous postconditions, and the new value of `b` is calculated based on the given formula.
