You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

    ><<
    
    4

Output

    1 4 7 10 8 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The movement of the pinball for i=2 is shown in the following pictures. It
takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

Specifically, each element in `A` represents the sum of the lengths of all segments between '>' characters up to that point, and each element in `idx_A` contains the indices where '>' characters are found.
    #
    #For example, if `s` is "><>>><", the final states would be:

    #- `idx_A` would be `[0, 2, 4, 5, 6]`

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for certain configurations. Specifically, the logic for calculating the time is flawed. Let's consider a few examples to illustrate this:

1. **Example 1**: For the input `"><"`
   - When the pinball starts at position 0 (index 0), it moves to the right to position 1 (index 1) and then back to the left to position 0 (index 0), taking 3 seconds to leave the grid.
   - When the pinball starts at position 1 (index 1), it moves to the left to position 0 (index 0) and then to the right to position 1 (index 1), taking 3 seconds to leave the grid.
   - However, the program outputs `3 3`, which is incorrect because the pinball at position 1 should take 2 seconds to leave the grid, not 3.

2. **Example 2**: For the input `">><<"`
   - When the pinball starts at position 0 (index 0), it moves to the right to position 1 (index 1), then to the left to position 0 (index 0), then to the right to position 1 (index 1), and finally to the left to position 0 (index 0), taking 5 seconds to leave the grid.
   - When the pinball starts at position 1 (index 1), it moves to the left to position 0 (index 0), then to the right to position 1 (index 1), then to the left to position 0 (index 0), and finally to the right to position 1 (index 1), taking 4 seconds to leave the grid.
   - When the pinball starts at position 2 (index 2), it moves to the right to position 3 (index 3), then to the left to position 2 (index 2), then to the right to position 3 (index 3), and finally to the left to position 2 (index 2), taking 5 seconds to leave the grid.
   - When the pinball starts at position 3 (index 3), it moves to the left to position 2 (index 2), then to the right to position 3 (index 3), then to the left to position 2 (index 2), and finally to the right to position 3 (index 3), taking 4 seconds to leave the grid.
   - However, the program outputs `5 4 5 4`, which is incorrect because the pinball at position 2 should take 3 seconds to leave the grid, not 5.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid in certain scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
