Output State: **`l` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is 0, `idx_B` contains all indices where `s` has a '<' character from the last to the first, and `B` is a list where each element is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each iteration.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `l`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `i`, `idx_B`, or `B`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
