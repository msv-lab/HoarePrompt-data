Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is '>', and `l` is less than `r`; `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `b = b - B[x]` updates the value of `b` by subtracting `B[x]` from its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `b` is `B[r - 1]` before the operation is updated to `b` being `B[r - 1] - B[x]` after the operation.
