### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store intermediate results:
     - `A` stores the cumulative time for pinballs starting from the left side.
     - `B` stores the cumulative time for pinballs starting from the right side.
   - The logic to fill these arrays is as follows:
     - For each position `i` where `s[i] == '>'`, it updates `A` with the cumulative time considering the positions of all previous `>` characters.
     - Similarly, for each position `i` where `s[i] == '<'`, it updates `B` with the cumulative time considering the positions of all previous `<` characters.
   - These arrays help in efficiently calculating the time taken for pinballs to leave the grid.

3. **Complexity and Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` involves iterating through the string `s` twice (once from left to right and once from right to left).
   - The calculations in `A` and `B` are designed to capture the cumulative lengths of segments between `>` and `<` characters, respectively.
   - The final computation of the time taken for each cell involves combining the values from `A` and `B` based on the current character and its position.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` again to compute the final time for each cell.
   - The logic here correctly applies the movement and inversion rules to compute the time taken for each pinball to leave the grid.
   - The calculations involve checking the current character and using the precomputed values from `A` and `B` to determine the time taken.

#### Detailed Issues:

- **Handling of Movement and Inversion:**
  - The program correctly handles the movement and inversion rules by updating the cumulative times in `A` and `B` and then using these values to compute the final time.
  - The logic is complex but follows the intended behavior of the problem.

- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - The program correctly handles boundary conditions by ensuring that the pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
  - The calculations account for the correct number of steps based on the current character and its position.

- **Clear Explanation:**
  - While the code is complex, it is designed to accurately reflect the problem's requirements. The logic is sound and follows the movement and inversion rules.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to compute the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The complexity of the code is due to the efficient use of cumulative times stored in `A` and `B`, which ensures correctness.

**Correctness: **True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
