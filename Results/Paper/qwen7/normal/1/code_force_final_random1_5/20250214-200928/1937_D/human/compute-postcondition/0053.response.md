Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `B` is `[x]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not recalculated within the snippet. Therefore, `B` now contains the new element `x`. The values of `j` and `i` remain the same as they are not affected by the operation.
