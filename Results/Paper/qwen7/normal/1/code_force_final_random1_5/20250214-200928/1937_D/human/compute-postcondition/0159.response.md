Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is equal to `A[l]`: This means `a` takes the value of the element at index `l` in the list `A`.
   - `i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0: If `i` was not 0, then `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.
   - `n` must be greater than 0: This indicates that `n` is a positive integer.
   - `r` is decreased by 1: This means `r` takes the value of `r - 1`.
   - `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`: Here, `b` is calculated as the difference between the element at index `r - 1` in the list `idx_B` and `i`, multiplied by `l + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

Given the above, let's determine the values:

- `a` is `A[l]`.
- `i` could either be `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, or it remains `i` if `i` was 0.
- `r` is `r - 1`.
- `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

Since the exact values of `i`, `r`, `l`, `A`, `idx_B`, and `n` are not provided, we need to express the final expression in terms of these variables.

The expression to be printed is:
\[ a \times 2 + b \times 2 + i + 1 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ A[l] \times 2 + ((idx_B[r - 1] - i) \times (l + 1)) \times 2 + i + 1 \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ 2A[l] + 2(idx_B[r - 1] - i)(l + 1) + i + 1 \]

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2A[l] + 2(idx_B[r - 1] - i)(l + 1) + i + 1**
