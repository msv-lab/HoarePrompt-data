### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each position \( i \) in the grid. The logic in the code seems to be designed to handle this by using two arrays (`A` and `B`) to store cumulative distances related to the positions of the characters `>` and `<` respectively.

1. **Initialization and Calculation of `A` and `B`:**
   - `A` is built by iterating through the string `s` from left to right, recording the cumulative distance to the nearest `>` character.
   - `B` is built by iterating through the string `s` from right to left, recording the cumulative distance to the nearest `<` character.

2. **Calculation of Time to Leave the Grid:**
   - For each position \( i \) in the string `s`, the program checks whether the character at position \( i \) is `>` or `<`.
   - If the character is `>`, it calculates the time to reach the right boundary by considering the cumulative distances stored in `A` and `B`.
   - If the character is `<`, it calculates the time to reach the left boundary by considering the cumulative distances stored in `B` and `A`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundaries or where there are no `>` or `<` characters before or after the current position.

The logic in the program appears to correctly implement the rules described in the problem statement. Each part of the logic is designed to accurately calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from any starting position \( i \).

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each position \( i \).

**Correctness: True**
