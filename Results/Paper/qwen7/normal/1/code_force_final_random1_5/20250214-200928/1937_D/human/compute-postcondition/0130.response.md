Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `r` is equal to 0

We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement: `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. `i` is 0.
2. `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified, so we'll keep it as `n`.
3. `idx_A[l - 1]` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. However, since it is used in the expression, we need to consider how it affects the result.

The expression simplifies to:
\[ n - 0 + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) \times 2 \]
\[ = n - 2 \times idx_A[l - 1] \]

Since `idx_A[l - 1]` is not defined, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the expression. However, we know that `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the output will be a string representation of the expression with `n` and `idx_A[l - 1]` included.

Output: **n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]**
