Output State: **`B` is an empty list, `s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in `s`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `idx_B = []` initializes `idx_B` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `B`, `s`, `A`, or `idx_A`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
