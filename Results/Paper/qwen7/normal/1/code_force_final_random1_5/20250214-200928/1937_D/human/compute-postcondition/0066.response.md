Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` is `[i, n - 4]`, and `B` is `[0, 2 * (n - 4)]`.**

Explanation: The code `idx_B.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Given that `i` is `n - 4` and `idx_B` was either `[i, n - 4]` or `[i]`, appending `i` to `idx_B` changes its state to `[i, n - 4]`. Since `i` is `n - 4`, the updated `idx_B` is `[n - 4, n - 4]`. Also, since `B` is either `[0]` or `[x, 2 * (n - 4)]` where `x` is `2 * (n - 4)` if `idx_B` is not empty, and `idx_B` is now not empty, `B` remains `[0, 2 * (n - 4)]`. The values of `j` and `i` remain unchanged.
