Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `r` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is the value of `B[r]`.
- `b` is the value of `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. Given that `i` is 0, this simplifies to `b + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1) = b - idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the expression to be printed:

- `a * 2` will be `2 * B[r]`.
- `b * 2` will be `2 * (b - idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1))`.
- `(n - i)` will be `n - 0 = n`.

So, the expression to be printed is `2 * B[r] + 2 * (b - idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)) + n`.

Output: **2 * B[r] + 2 * (b - idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)) + n**
