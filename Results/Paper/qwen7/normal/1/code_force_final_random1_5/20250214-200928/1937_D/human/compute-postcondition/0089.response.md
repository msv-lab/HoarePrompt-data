Output: **n - 0 (where n is a value greater than 0)**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given as 0.
- The variable `n` is mentioned to be greater than 0 but does not have an explicit value, so we keep it as `n`.
- The `end=' '` in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space, but it does not affect what is printed.

Therefore, the expression `n - i` simplifies to `n - 0`, which is simply `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0, the output will be `n` followed by a space.
