Output State: **`a` is equal to `A[l]`, `i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from the current value of `b`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `n`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
