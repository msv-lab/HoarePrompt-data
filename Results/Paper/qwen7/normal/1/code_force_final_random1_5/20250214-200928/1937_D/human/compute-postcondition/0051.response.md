Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `B` is a list containing 0**

The code `B.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `B`. Since no initial definition of `B` was given, we assume `B` is an empty list before this operation. After appending `0`, `B` becomes a list containing just `0`. The values of `j` and `i` remain unchanged.
