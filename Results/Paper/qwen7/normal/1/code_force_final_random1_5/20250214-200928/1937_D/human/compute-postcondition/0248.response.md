Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `n` remains greater than 0, and `l` remains the same. `a` and `b` retain their original values. If `l <= r`, then depending on the value of `l`:
- If `l == 0`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- If `l > 0`, `a` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
Otherwise, if `l > r`, then `a` is set to `B[r]`, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1).***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes of the if-else block based on the value of `l` relative to `r` and the specific conditions provided for updating `a` and `b`.
