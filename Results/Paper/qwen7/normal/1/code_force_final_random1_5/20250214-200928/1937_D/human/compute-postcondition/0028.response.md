Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing `[0, 2, 4, 2, 7]`, `idx_A` is a list containing `[0, 2, 2]`, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: 
- If the condition `len(idx_A) == 0` is true, the program does not change the values of `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, and `i`.
- If the condition `len(idx_A) == 0` is false, `x` is set to 7, and `A` is updated to contain `[0, 2, 4, 2, 7]`.

Since the else part is executed regardless of the initial state of `len(idx_A)`, the final state of `A` will always be `[0, 2, 4, 2, 7]`, and the other variables (`s`, `idx_A`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
