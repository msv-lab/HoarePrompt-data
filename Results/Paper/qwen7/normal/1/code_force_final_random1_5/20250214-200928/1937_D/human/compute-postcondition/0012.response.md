Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing `[0, i]`, `idx_A` is a list containing `[0]`, and `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `idx_A.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `idx_A`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
