Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution seems overly complex and does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball as described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement Duration**:
   - The logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed. The current implementation uses a combination of indices and precomputed values (`A` and `B`) to derive the time, but it does not accurately reflect the pinball's movement and inversion rules.
   - Specifically, the calculation of `a` and `b` in the nested loops does not correctly account for the pinball's movement and the changes in direction.

2. **Complexity and Unnecessary Preprocessing**:
   - The solution involves precomputing arrays `A` and `B`, which are not necessary for solving the problem efficiently. Instead, a simpler approach can directly simulate the movement of the pinball for each query.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The solution does not handle edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundary cells (either the leftmost or rightmost cell) correctly. These cases should be handled separately to avoid unnecessary complexity.

### Suggested Approach:
A more straightforward approach would be to simulate the movement of the pinball for each query independently. This involves:
- Starting from the initial position.
- Moving the pinball according to the direction indicated by the current cell.
- Inverting the direction after each move.
- Stopping the simulation when the pinball leaves the grid.

Here is a simplified version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    results = []
    for i in range(n):
        pos = i
        time = 0
        while 0 <= pos < n:
            time += 1
            if s[pos] == '<':
                pos -= 1
            else:
                pos += 1
            s = s[:pos] + ('<' if s[pos] == '>' else '>') + s[pos+1:]
        results.append(time)
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))
```

This approach directly simulates the movement of the pinball for each query, ensuring correctness and simplicity.
