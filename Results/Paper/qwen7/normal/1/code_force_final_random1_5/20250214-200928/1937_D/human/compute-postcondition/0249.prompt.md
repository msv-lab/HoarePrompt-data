Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is 0, `idx_B` contains all indices where `s` has a '<' character from the last to the first, `B` is a list where each element is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `r` is the length of `B`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or increased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1 at least once, `l` is 0 if `l <= r` is true, otherwise `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `r` becomes 0, then `r` remains 0, otherwise `a` is the value of `B[r]`, and `b` is the value of `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1 if it was not 0, `n` remains greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, and depending on whether `l` is 0 or not, either:
- If `l` is 0, then `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and `a` and `b` retain their original values otherwise.
- If `l` is not 0, then `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and `l - r - 1` is not greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `n` remains greater than 0, and `l` remains the same. `a` and `b` retain their original values. If `l <= r`, then depending on the value of `l`:
- If `l == 0`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- If `l > 0`, `a` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
Otherwise, if `l > r`, then `a` is set to `B[r]`, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
