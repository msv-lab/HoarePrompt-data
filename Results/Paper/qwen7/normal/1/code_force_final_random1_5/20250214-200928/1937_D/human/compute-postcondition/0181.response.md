Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial postconditions. Therefore, the updated value of `b` is the sum of its previous value and the calculated term `(idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
