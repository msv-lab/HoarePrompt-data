Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`. This means `i` has been incremented by 1.
- `r` is `r - 1`. This means `r` has been decremented by 1.
- `n` remains greater than 0. So, `n` is still a positive number.
- `l` remains the same. The value of `l` has not changed.
- `a` and `b` retain their original values. The values of `a` and `b` have not changed.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

Given that `i` has been incremented by 1, if the original value of `i` was `i0`, then the new value of `i` is `i0 + 1`.

The expression `n - i` will therefore be `n - (i0 + 1) = n - i0 - 1`.

Since `n` remains greater than 0 and `i0` is some initial value of `i`, the exact numerical value cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n` and `i0`. However, we know it will be `n` minus the original value of `i` minus 1.

Output: **n - i0 - 1 (where i0 is the original value of i and n is a positive number)**
