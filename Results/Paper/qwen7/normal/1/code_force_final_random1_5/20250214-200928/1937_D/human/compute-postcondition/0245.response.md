Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, and `a` and `b` retain their original values. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then either:
- `a` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` and `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `l` is not 0, or
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged if `l` is 0.
Otherwise, `a` is set to `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
