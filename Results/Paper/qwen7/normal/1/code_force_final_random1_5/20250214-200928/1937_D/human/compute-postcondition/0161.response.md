Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r.**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` will be `i + 1` if it was not 0, otherwise, it remains the same.
- The variable `n` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `r` is decreased by 1.
- The variable `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. This calculation is performed at the start of the next iteration.
