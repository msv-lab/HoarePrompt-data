Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, `b` is A[l - 1]**.

This means that the variable `b` is now assigned the value of `A[l - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions: `i` is incremented by 1 if it was not 0, `n` must still be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, and `a` remains as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
