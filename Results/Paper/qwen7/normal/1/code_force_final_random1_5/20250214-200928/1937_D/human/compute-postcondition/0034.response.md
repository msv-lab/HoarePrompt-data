Output State: **`B` is an empty list, `s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in `s`, and `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of '>' characters in `s`.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `B`. The values of `s`, `A`, and `idx_A` remain unchanged from their initial state because no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet. Therefore, `B` is now an empty list, while `s`, `A`, and `idx_A` retain their previously defined characteristics.
