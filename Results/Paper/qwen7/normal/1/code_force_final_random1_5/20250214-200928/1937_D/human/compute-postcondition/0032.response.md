Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows: `s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing `[0, 2, 4, 2, 7, ..., final_value_of_A]`, `idx_A` is a list containing `[0, 2, 2, 3, ..., final_value_of_idx_A]`, and `i` is `n-1`. The lists `A` and `idx_A` are extended based on the condition that whenever the character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', the value of `x` is appended to `A` and the current index `i` is appended to `idx_A`. The exact values of `final_value_of_A` and `final_value_of_idx_A` depend on the positions of '>' in the string `s`.
