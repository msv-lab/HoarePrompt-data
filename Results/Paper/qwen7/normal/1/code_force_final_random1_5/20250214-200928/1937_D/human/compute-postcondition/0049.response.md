Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` in the range `range(0, n)`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1 - j`.
   - If `s[i]` is '<':
     - If the length of `idx_B` is 0, `B` contains 0.
     - Otherwise, `x` is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and then appended to `B`; `idx_B` now contains the value `i`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each time, the next value of `j` will be 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `n - 1 - 1` or `n - 2`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be 1.
   - `i` will be `n - 2`.

5. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - The conditions for the next iteration depend on the value of `s[i]` and the state of `idx_B` and `B`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`**.
