Postcondition: **If `r` is 0, then `i` is increased by 1 if it was not 0, `n` remains greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, and `a` and `b` retain their values from the previous iteration. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 if it was not 0, `n` remains greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is either `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` or `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`, and `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the program after executing the if-else block, considering both cases where `r` is 0 and where `r` is not 0.
