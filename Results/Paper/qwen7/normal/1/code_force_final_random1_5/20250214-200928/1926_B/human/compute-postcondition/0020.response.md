Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or remains 1, `k` is a list containing the integers 1 and the count of '1' in each of the input strings `b` for each iteration of the loop, and `b` is the last input string from the user.**

In this final state, `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 100, and `a` will still be a positive integer. The variable `i` will either be 2 (indicating that the loop has executed more than once) or it will remain 1 if the loop only executed once. The list `k` will contain the integer 1 followed by the count of '1' characters in each of the input strings provided during the loop's iterations. The variable `b` will hold the value of the last input string processed by the loop.
