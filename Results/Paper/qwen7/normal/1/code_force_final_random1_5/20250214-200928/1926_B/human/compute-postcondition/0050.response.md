Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `k` is a list containing the total count of '1's across all input strings provided during the loop executions.
- `b` is the most recent input string from the user.
- `num` is the most recent positive integer provided by the user.
- The first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`.

The `print` statement in question simply prints the string `'TRIANGLE'`. Since no variables or objects within the `print` statement are being evaluated or referenced, the output will be the literal string provided.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
