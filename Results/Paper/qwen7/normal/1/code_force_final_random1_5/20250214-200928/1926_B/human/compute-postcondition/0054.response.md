Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `k` is an empty list, `b` is the most recent input string from the user, and `num` is the most recent positive integer provided by the user.**

The code initializes `k` as an empty list. This changes the value of `k` but does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, or `num`.
