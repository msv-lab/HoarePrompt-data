You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 100 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and an n x n grid of characters ('0' or '1'). It determines whether the grid contains a triangle or a square that includes all the '1's and prints 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' accordingly for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the type of shape found for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Let's analyze why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid and the grid itself.
3. It then checks the number of '1's in each row and compares the counts to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.

However, this approach is flawed because:
- It only checks the number of '1's in each row but does not verify the specific pattern required for a triangle or a square.
- The program assumes that if the counts of '1's in the rows are the same, then the shape is a square, which is not always true. For example, consider the following grid:
```
00000
00000
01110
01110
01110
00000
```
This grid has the same number of '1's in each row, but it does not form a square or a triangle. Instead, it forms a rectangle.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to check the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square. For instance, for a triangle:
- The middle row should have the maximum number of '1's.
- Each subsequent row above and below the middle row should have two fewer '1's than the previous row.

And for a square:
- All rows should have the same number of '1's.

Since the provided program does not implement these checks, it will fail for many valid test cases, making it incorrect.
