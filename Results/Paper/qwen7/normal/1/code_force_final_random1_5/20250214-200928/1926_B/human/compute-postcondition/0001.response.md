State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is the integer input for the first test case, `i` must be 0, `a` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `a` must be greater than 0.
3. Initially, `i` is set to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `a` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to 0. The value of `t` (which is given as an integer between 1 and 100) does not directly affect the loop's execution but is mentioned in the initial state.
