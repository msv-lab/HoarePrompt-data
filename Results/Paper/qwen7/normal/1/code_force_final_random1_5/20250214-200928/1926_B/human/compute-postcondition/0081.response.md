Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes t test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a grid of n x n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, with the size of the shape being greater than 1. For each test case, the function determines whether the shape is a triangle or a square and returns the type of the shape for each test case.**
