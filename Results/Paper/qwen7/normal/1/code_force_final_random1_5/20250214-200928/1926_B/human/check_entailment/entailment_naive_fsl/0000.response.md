Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Let's analyze why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid and the grid itself.
3. It then checks the number of '1's in each row and compares the counts to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.

However, this approach is flawed because:
- It only checks the number of '1's in each row but does not verify the specific pattern required for a triangle or a square.
- The program assumes that if the counts of '1's in the rows are the same, then the shape is a square, which is not always true. For example, consider the following grid:
```
00000
00000
01110
01110
01110
00000
```
This grid has the same number of '1's in each row, but it does not form a square or a triangle. Instead, it forms a rectangle.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to check the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square. For instance, for a triangle:
- The middle row should have the maximum number of '1's.
- Each subsequent row above and below the middle row should have two fewer '1's than the previous row.

And for a square:
- All rows should have the same number of '1's.

Since the provided program does not implement these checks, it will fail for many valid test cases, making it incorrect.
