Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires identifying whether the '1's in a binary grid form a square or a triangle.
2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`a`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`) and then reads `n` lines of input.
   - It checks if there are any '1's in each row and appends the count of '1's in that row to the list `k`.
   - After processing all rows, it compares the counts of '1's in the first two rows.
     - If the counts are equal, it prints 'SQUARE'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The logic in the given code does not correctly identify the shapes. It only checks the count of '1's in the first two rows, which is insufficient to determine the shape.
   - For a square, the counts of '1's in each row should be the same and equal to `k`. For a triangle, the counts of '1's in the rows should follow the pattern `1, 3, 5, ...` (odd numbers).
   - The current implementation does not check these patterns correctly.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly identify the shape, we need to:
     - Check if the counts of '1's in each row match the expected pattern for a square or a triangle.
     - For a square, the count of '1's in the i-th row should be `k`.
     - For a triangle, the count of '1's in the i-th row should be `2*i - 1`.

Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
