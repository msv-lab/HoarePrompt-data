Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, a is the integer input for the first test case.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print('SQUARE')
    else:
        print('TRIANGLE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or remains 1, `k` is a list containing the integers 1 and the count of '1' in each of the input strings `b` for each iteration of the loop, and `b` is the last input string from the user, and the final state of `k[0]` is either equal to `k[1]` or not equal to `k[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the total count of '1's across all input strings provided during the loop executions, `b` is the most recent input string from the user, and `num` is the most recent positive integer provided by the user. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, no changes occur. If the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`, no changes occur either.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `b` is an input integer from the user, and `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's in the binary representation of all integers provided as input through the loop. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the program does not change `k`. If the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`, the program does not change `k` either.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
