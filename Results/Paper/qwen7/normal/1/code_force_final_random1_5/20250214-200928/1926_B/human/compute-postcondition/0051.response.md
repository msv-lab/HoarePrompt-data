Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the total count of '1's across all input strings provided during the loop executions, `b` is the most recent input string from the user, and `num` is the most recent positive integer provided by the user. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, no changes are made. Otherwise, the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`.
