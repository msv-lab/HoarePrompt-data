Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is an empty list, `b` is the last input string from the user, and the final state of `k[0]` is either equal to `k[1]` or not equal to `k[1]`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `k` as an empty list. This means that the list `k` now contains no elements, effectively making it an empty list. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
