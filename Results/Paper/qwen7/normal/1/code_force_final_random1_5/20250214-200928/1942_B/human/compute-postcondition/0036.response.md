Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs in reverse order from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`.

2. **Understand the postconditions given:**
   - After each iteration, `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.
   - If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed:**
   - The loop starts with `i` being `len(ar) - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until it reaches `-1`.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be `-1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` is decremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `-1 - 1 = -2`.
   - The value of `mex` remains unchanged unless it is updated within the loop body, but since no update is mentioned in the postcondition, `mex` stays the same.

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - The only state that needs adjustment is `i`, which should now be `-2`.
   - The other states (`res`, `ar`, and `mex`) remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is -2**
