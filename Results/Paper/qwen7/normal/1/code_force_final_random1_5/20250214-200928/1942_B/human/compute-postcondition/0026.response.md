Output State: **`i` is 0, `mex` is reduced by the sum of all elements in `ar`, each element in `res` is set to `mex - ar[0]`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `ar`. The initial state of `i` and `mex` remains unchanged, and `res` is not explicitly defined in the given code, so its state remains as previously described (each element in `res` is set to `mex - ar[0]`). The variable `n` remains an input integer.
