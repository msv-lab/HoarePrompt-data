Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but contains a logical error. Specifically, the logic for calculating `mex` and assigning values to `res` is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`:**
   - The code calculates `mex` as `n` initially and updates it incorrectly.
   - It should find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `res`.

2. **Reversing the Loop:**
   - The loop is reversed (`for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1)`), which is unnecessary and complicates the logic.

3. **Updating `mex`:**
   - The update of `mex` inside the loop is incorrect. It should be updated based on the current value of `res[i]`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [-1] * n  # Initialize result array with -1
        used = set()   # Track used numbers
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `res` with `-1` and use a set `used` to track the numbers already used in the permutation.

2. **Finding `mex`:**
   - For each position `i`, find the smallest non-negative integer `mex` not in `used`.
   - Assign `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` and add `res[i]` to `used`.

3. **Output:**
   - Print the result array `res`.

This approach ensures that the permutation `p` is correctly constructed based on the given `a` array.
