Based on the initial state described:

- After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `-1`.
- `mex` will be reduced by the sum of all elements in `ar`.
- Each element in `res` will be set to `mex - ar[i]` for the last valid `i` value.

Given that `i` is `-1` after the loop, it implies that the loop has completed its iterations and no valid `i` was found (or the loop ended because `i` became `-1`). Therefore, `mex - ar[i]` for the last valid `i` value would essentially be `mex - ar[-1]`, but since `i` is `-1`, `ar[i]` does not exist in the usual sense (it's out of bounds).

However, since `i` is `-1`, the expression `mex - ar[i]` simplifies to just `mex` because `ar[i]` does not contribute to the calculation due to the out-of-bounds nature.

So, each element in `res` will be set to `mex`.

Therefore, the output will be a list where every element is `mex`.

Output: **mex mex mex ... (a list where every element is mex)**
