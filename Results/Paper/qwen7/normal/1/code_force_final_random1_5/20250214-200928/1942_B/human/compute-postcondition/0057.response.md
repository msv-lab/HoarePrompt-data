Output State: **`i` is `-len(ar)`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`**.

Explanation: The value of `mex` is updated by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Since `i` is `-len(ar)`, the value of `i` remains unchanged. The value of `res[i]` is also updated to reflect the new value of `mex - ar[i]`.
