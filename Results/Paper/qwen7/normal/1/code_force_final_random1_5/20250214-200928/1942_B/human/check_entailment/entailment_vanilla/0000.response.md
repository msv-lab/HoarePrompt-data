Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
Given:
- A permutation \( p \) of length \( n \).
- An array \( a \) of length \( n \) where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

We need to find a permutation \( p \) that satisfies the condition for \( a \).

### Given Program Analysis
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values of length \( n \).
   - `mex` is initialized to \( n \).

3. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates backward through the array \( a \).
   - For each index \( i \), it calculates \( res[i] = \texttt{mex} - a[i] \).
   - It then updates `mex` to be `mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The result is printed as a space-separated string.

### Issues with the Program
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`:**
   - The logic to update `mex` is flawed. The program incorrectly updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` which does not align with the definition of MEX.
   - The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of \( p \), but the program is incorrectly updating `mex` based on the value of `ar[i]`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing Permutation:**
   - The program attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) by directly calculating `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, which is not a valid approach to solve the problem.
   - The MEX calculation and permutation construction need to be handled more carefully.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Initialize the permutation \( p \) with values from 0 to \( n-1 \).
2. Calculate the MEX for each prefix of \( p \) and ensure it matches the corresponding value in \( a \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = list(range(n))
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in res[:i+1]:
                mex += 1
            assert ar[i] == mex - res[i], "Invalid permutation"
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for calculating `mex` and constructing the permutation. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
