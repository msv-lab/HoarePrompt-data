Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
  - `i` will be `-len(ar)`
  - `mex` will be the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `len(ar)`
  - `res` will be a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i`

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
- The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which is typically an underscore when the loop variable is not used within the loop body.
- The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`.

### State Adjustments
Since the loop variable `_` is not used, the only variables that can be adjusted are those that might change inside the loop. However, based on the given information, no specific variables are mentioned as changing inside the loop. Therefore, the only variables that need to be considered are those that are part of the initial state and might be affected by the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `i` will be `-len(ar)`
- `mex` will be the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `len(ar)`
- `res` will be a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i`

For the loop to execute one more time, the only thing that changes is the number of iterations left. Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the number of iterations left is reduced by 1.

### Updated State
- `i` remains `-len(ar)` (unchanged)
- `mex` remains the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `len(ar)` (unchanged)
- `res` remains a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i` (unchanged)

However, the number of iterations left is reduced by 1.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is -len(ar), `mex` is the minimum value of mex - ar[i] for all i in the range of len(ar), `res` is a list of length n where each element is mex - ar[i] for the corresponding index i, and the number of iterations left is int(input()) - 1**
