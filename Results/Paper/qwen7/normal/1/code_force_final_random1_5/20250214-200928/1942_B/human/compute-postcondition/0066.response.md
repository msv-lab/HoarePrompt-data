Output State: **`i` is `-len(ar) + 1`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, and `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`**

Explanation: The code `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `res[i]` to be equal to `mex - ar[i]`. Since the initial state already specifies that `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, this assignment does not change the value of `res[i]`. The values of `i` and `mex` remain unchanged from their initial states.
