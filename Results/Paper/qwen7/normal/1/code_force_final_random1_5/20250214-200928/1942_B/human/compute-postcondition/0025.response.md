Output State: **`i` is 0, `mex` is reduced by the sum of all elements in `ar`, each element in `res` is set to `mex - ar[0]`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `mex`, `ar`, or `res`. Therefore, the values of `i`, `mex`, `ar`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `n` is now assigned the value of the input integer.
