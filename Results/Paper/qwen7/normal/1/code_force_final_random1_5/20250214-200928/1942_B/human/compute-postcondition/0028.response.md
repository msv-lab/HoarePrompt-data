Output State: **`i` is 0, `mex` is `n`, each element in `res` is set to `mex - ar[0]`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is initialized to `None`.**

Explanation: The code sets `mex` to the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
