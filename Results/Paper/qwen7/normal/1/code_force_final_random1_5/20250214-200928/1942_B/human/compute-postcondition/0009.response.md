Output State: **`res[i]' is equal to `mex - ar[i]' - ar[i]', `mex' is equal to `mex - ar[i]', `ar` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. This means that the new value of `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`. The values of `res[i]` and `ar` remain unchanged, but `res[i]` is now equal to `mex - ar[i]` - ar[i], which simplifies to `mex - 2*ar[i]`. The precondition that `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]` no longer holds since `mex` has been updated.
