Output State: `i` is `-1`, `mex` is `mex - len(ar)*ar[-1] + sum(ar)`, and `res[i+1:]` is `[mex - ar[i] for i in range(-1, -len(ar)-1, -1)]`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `-1` because the loop starts from `-len(ar)` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`. The value of `mex` will be updated in each iteration based on the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]: mex = mex - ar[i]`. This results in `mex` being adjusted by subtracting twice the current `mex` and adding the current `ar[i]` for each iteration. The `res` list will be filled starting from index `-1` up to the original length of `ar`, with each element set to `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding `i` value.
