Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `cur` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, and `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur_ss` are as described.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is either 1 or 2 and `t` is greater than 0, the loop can continue if `i` is less than `t`.
   - If `i` is 1 or 2, it will increment to 2 or 3 respectively in the next iteration.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

- If `i` was 1, it will become 2.
- If `i` was 2, it will become 3.
- `t` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`cur` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the total number of characters in the original string `s`, `ans` is the concatenation of every second character from the original string `s` starting from the first character, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of each processed character minus 97.**
