Output State: **`cur` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` is updated to the new string input by the user, `cnt` is the total number of characters in the new string `s`, `ans` is the concatenation of every second character from the new string `s` starting from the first character, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of each processed character minus 97.**

The code `s = input()` reads a new string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. This updates the value of `s` to the newly input string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
