Postcondition: **`cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss` and then 1 is added, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one less character, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is either `ss` or `ss` + `ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` - 97, and the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is either satisfied or not satisfied depending on the execution path taken.**
