Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^5, and we have read the value of `t` from input.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) are preserved, and now `t` holds the specific value entered by the user.
