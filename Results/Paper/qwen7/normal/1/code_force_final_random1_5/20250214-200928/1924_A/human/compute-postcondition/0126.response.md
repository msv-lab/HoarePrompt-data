Output State: **`cur` is an integer that has been updated through all iterations, `tmp` is a string containing characters from 'a' to 'j' based on the conditions met in each iteration, `i` is equal to `k`, and `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution, which is less than `n`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `cur` will have been updated according to the bitwise operations performed in each iteration. The variable `tmp` will contain a string composed of characters from 'a' to 'j', depending on which conditions were met in each iteration. The variable `i` will have reached its maximum value, which is `k`, as the loop increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches `k`. The variable `cnt` will count how many times `cur` reached the value `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution, and this count will be less than `n` as per the given condition.
