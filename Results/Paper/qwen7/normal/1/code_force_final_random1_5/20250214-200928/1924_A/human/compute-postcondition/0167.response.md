Output State: **`cnt` is either 1 or 2, `cur` is updated to `cur + 1 << cur_ss`, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `ans` is equal to `ss` if `cur` does not equal `1 << cur_ss` and `2 * (ord(ss) - ord('a'))` otherwise.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `cnt` is either 0 or 1.
- The code `cnt += 1` increments `cnt` by 1. Therefore, if `cnt` was initially 0, it becomes 1; if it was initially 1, it becomes 2.
- The values of `cur`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
