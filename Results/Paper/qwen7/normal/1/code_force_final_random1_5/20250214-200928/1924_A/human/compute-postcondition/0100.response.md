Output State: **`cur` is 0, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, `cnt` is 1**.

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was not defined in the initial state, so it is assumed to be 0. After executing the line, `cnt` becomes 1. The values of `cur`, `ans`, `s`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged as the code does not modify these variables.
