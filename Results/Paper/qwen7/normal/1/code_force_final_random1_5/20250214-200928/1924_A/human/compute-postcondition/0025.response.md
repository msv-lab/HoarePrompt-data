Output State: **`cur` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one less character, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is equal to `ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` - 97, and the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is no longer satisfied.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Since `cur` was previously defined as `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss` and then 1 was added, setting `cur` to 0 means the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` can no longer be true because `cur` is now 0 and cannot satisfy the bitwise AND operation with `1 << cur_ss`.
