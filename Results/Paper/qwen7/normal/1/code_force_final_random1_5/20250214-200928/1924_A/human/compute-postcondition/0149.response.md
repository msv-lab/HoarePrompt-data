Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `ans` is equal to `ss`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += ss` adds the value of `ss` to `ans`. Since `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `ans` now holds the value of `ss`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
