Output State: **`cur` is 0, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, `cur_ss` is calculated as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `cur_ss` as the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`. The other variables (`cur`, `ans`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
