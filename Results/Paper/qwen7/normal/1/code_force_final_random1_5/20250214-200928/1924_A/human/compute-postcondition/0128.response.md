Output State: **`ans` is `ans` plus 'a' multiplied by (n - cnt - 1), `cur` is an integer that has been updated through all iterations, `tmp` is a string containing characters from 'a' to 'j' based on the conditions met in each iteration, `i` is equal to `k`, and `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution, which is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` appends the string `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times to the variable `ans`. The other variables (`cur`, `tmp`, `i`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
