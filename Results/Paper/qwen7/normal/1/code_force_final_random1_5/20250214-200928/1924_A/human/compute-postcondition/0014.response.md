Postcondition: `cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, and `cur` is equal to \(1\) left-shifted by `k` and then subtracted by 1.
