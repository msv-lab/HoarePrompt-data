Output State: **`cur` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the total number of characters in the original string `s`, `ans` is the concatenation of every second character from the original string `s` starting from the first character, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of each processed character minus 97, `n`, `k`, and `m` are assigned values from the input split.**

The code `n, k, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
