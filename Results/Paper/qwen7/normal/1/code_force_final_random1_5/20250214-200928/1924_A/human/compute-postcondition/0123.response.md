Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `tmp` is 'a' + `i` - `i_prev` - 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the value of `tmp` was being updated. The values of `cur`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the loop or conditional block is exited.
