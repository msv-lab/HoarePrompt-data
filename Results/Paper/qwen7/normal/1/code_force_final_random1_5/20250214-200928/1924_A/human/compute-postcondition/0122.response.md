Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `tmp` is 'a' + `i` - `i_prev` - 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `tmp` is now equal to `chr(ord('a') + i)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `tmp` to be the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `ord('a') + i`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
