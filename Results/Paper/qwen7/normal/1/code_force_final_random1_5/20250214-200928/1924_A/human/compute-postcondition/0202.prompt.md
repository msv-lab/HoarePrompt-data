You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt = 0
        
        cur = 0
        
        ans = ''
        
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
                ans += ss
        
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                    break
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial value read from input. After all iterations, the following conditions will hold:
    #
    #- `cur` will be 0, as it is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration.
    #- `t` will be the same as the initial value read from input.
    #- `i` will be `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
    #- `n`, `k`, and `m` will retain their last values from the final iteration's input.
    #- `s` will be the string input in the last iteration.
    #- `cnt` will be the count of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during all iterations. This count can vary depending on the input strings but will be non-negative.
    #- `ans` will be constructed based on the conditions met during all iterations. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` will be the string `s` with certain characters removed according to the conditions. Otherwise, `ans` will be modified to include additional characters 'a' and possibly 'b' to meet the condition `cnt >= n`.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations, `cur` will be 0, `t` will be the same as the initial input, `i` will be `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` will be the values from the last iteration, `s` will be the last input string, `cnt` will reflect the total occurrences of the condition `(1 << k) - 1`, and `ans` will be the final constructed string based on the given rules.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes inputs through variables where t is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive. For each test case, n and k are integers between 1 and 26 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
