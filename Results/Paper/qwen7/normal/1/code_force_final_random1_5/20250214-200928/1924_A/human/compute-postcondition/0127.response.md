Output State: **`cur` is an integer that has been updated through all iterations, `tmp` is a string containing characters from 'a' to 'j' based on the conditions met in each iteration, `i` is equal to `k`, and `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution, which is less than `n`; `ans` is `ans` plus the value of `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += tmp` adds the current value of `tmp` to `ans`. Since `tmp` is a string, `ans` is assumed to be a string as well (if it wasn't already, it would be converted). The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
