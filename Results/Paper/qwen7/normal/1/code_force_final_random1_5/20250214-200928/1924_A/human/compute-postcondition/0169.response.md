Output State: **`cnt` is either 1 or 2, `cur` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `ans` is equal to `ss` + `ss` if `cur` does not equal `1 << cur_ss` and `2 * (ord(ss) - ord('a'))` otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` appends the character `ss` to the string `ans`. The value of `ans` is now twice the value of `ss` because it was previously set to `ss` and then `ss` was added to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
