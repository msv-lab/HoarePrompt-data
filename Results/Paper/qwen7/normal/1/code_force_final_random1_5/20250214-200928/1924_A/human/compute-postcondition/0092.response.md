Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, `ans` is updated by concatenating `ss` to it.**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` appends the character `ss` to the end of the string `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
