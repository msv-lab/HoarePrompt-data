Output State: **`cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `cnt` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which was not relevant since the initial value of `cnt` was not provided). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
