Postcondition: **`cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `cur` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a concatenation of characters from `s` based on the conditions met during the loop execution. If `cnt` has incremented to a value greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `cnt` is still less than `n`, `ans` is set to "abba" and `cur` is reset to 0.**
