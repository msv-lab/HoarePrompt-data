### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **func_4**: This function checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` is odd or the maximum possible value is less than `k`, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - **func_1**: This function attempts to construct a permutation that meets the required Manhattan value.
   - **func_2 & func_3**: These functions swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - **func_5**: Prints the permutation if found.
   - **func_6**: Main function that orchestrates the process.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The Manhattan value is always even because each term \( |p_i - i| \) is either even or odd, and their sum must be even.
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \) if `n` is odd, and \( \frac{n^2}{2} \) if `n` is even.

4. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - **func_4**: Correctly checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - **func_1**: Attempts to construct a permutation but seems overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.
   - **func_2 & func_3**: Swap elements to adjust the Manhattan value, which is a good approach but might not cover all scenarios.
   - **func_5 & func_6**: Correctly handle the output format.

5. **Testing Specific Cases:**
   - For small values of `n` and `k`, the function should produce correct results.
   - For larger values, the function should still work as long as the logic handles edge cases properly.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, the function correctly returns "NO".
   - When `k` is even and within the possible range, the function should return a valid permutation.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` starts by reducing `k` by half, assuming that each pair of elements can contribute up to 2 to the Manhattan value.
- It then iteratively adjusts the permutation using `func_2` and `func_3` to try to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
- However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the loop condition `range(n, -1, -2)` is problematic because it does not correctly handle the decrement step, leading to incorrect adjustments.
- The function assumes that each iteration can reduce `k` by a fixed amount, but this is not always true, especially for larger values of `n`.

### Example Counter-Case:
Consider the case where `n = 4` and `k = 5`. The maximum possible Manhattan value for `n = 4` is `6` (which is `8/2` since `n` is even). Since `k = 5` is within this range, we expect a valid permutation.

However, `func_1` will not be able to correctly generate a permutation for `k = 5` due to the flawed loop logic. Specifically, the loop will not correctly distribute the reductions needed to achieve `k = 5`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct but overlooks the fundamental flaw in `func_1`. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
