Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_4`**: This function ensures that `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a given `n`. If `k` is not even or if `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `0, 0`. Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function aims to construct a permutation whose Manhattan value matches `k`. It iteratively modifies a list `l` of integers from 1 to `n` by swapping elements to adjust the Manhattan value. The function handles different cases based on the value of `k` and the current position `i`.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function swaps two elements in the list `l` based on the indices `c` and `c - k`. This helps in adjusting the Manhattan value by changing the absolute differences.

4. **Function `func_3`**: This function swaps the elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c` in the list `l`. This is another way to adjust the Manhattan value.

5. **Function `func_5`**: This function prints the permutation and its Manhattan value matches `k`. It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` and ends with a newline.

6. **Function `func_6`**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to validate `n` and `k`, then `func_1` to generate the permutation, and finally `func_5` to print the result.

Given the problem constraints and the steps taken by each function, the overall logic of the program seems sound. The program correctly handles edge cases and attempts to find a valid permutation for the given `n` and `k`. If no valid permutation exists, it correctly outputs "NO".

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
