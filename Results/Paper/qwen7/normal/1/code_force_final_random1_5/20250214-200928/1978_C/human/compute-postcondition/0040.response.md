Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is \(n - 8\), `k` is \(n - 8\), the first element of list `l` is equal to the second last element of list `l`, and the second last element of list `l` is the same as the first element. If \(1 + i > k\), the function returns the list `l` which contains a single element `val`. Otherwise, the function returns the original list `l` where the first element is equal to the second last element, and the second last element is the same as the first element.
