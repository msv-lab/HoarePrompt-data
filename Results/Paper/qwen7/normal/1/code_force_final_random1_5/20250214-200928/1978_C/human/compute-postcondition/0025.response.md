Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs in reverse from `n` to `-1` with a step of `-2`. This means `i` starts at `n` and decreases by 2 each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `c` is 2.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `k` is updated based on the value of `n` and `i`.
   - `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n - 3` and the loop decrements by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be `i - 2`.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `n - 3`, the next value of `i` would be `(n - 3) - 2 = n - 5`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be `n - 5`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as the loop variable `i` is derived from `n`.

6. **Update other variables**:
   - `k` is updated based on the value of `n` and `i`. Since `i` changes to `n - 5`, `k` will be updated accordingly.
   - `l` remains the result of `func_3(c, l)` from the previous iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`c` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is `n - 5`, `k` is updated based on the new value of `i`, `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`**.
