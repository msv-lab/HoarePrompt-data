Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to construct a permutation with the given Manhattan value, but it does not cover all possible scenarios, particularly when the required Manhattan value `k` is odd or when the length `n` is odd and `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for that `n`.

For example, consider the test case where `n = 1` and `k = 1`. According to the problem description, there should be no permutation of length 1 with a Manhattan value of 1, so the output should be "No". However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly and might return a permutation, leading to an incorrect result.

Additionally, the function `func_1` has a logical flaw in how it handles the construction of the permutation when `k` is odd. It always divides `k` by 2, which is incorrect because the Manhattan value can be odd, and the function does not account for this possibility.

To fix these issues, the program needs to properly handle cases where `k` is odd and ensure that the constructed permutation meets the exact Manhattan value requirement.
