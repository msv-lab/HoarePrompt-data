Postcondition: `c` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is `n - 5`, `k` is updated based on the new value of `i`, `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`. If `k` equals 0, the function returns the result of `func_3(3, l)`, where `l` is the value of `i` which is `n - 5`. If `k` does not equal 0, the postcondition remains as initially described.
