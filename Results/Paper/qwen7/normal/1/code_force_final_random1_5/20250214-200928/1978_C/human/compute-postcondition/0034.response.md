Output State: **`c` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is `n - 5`, `k` is `k - i + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`; `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)` again.**

Explanation: The line `l = func_3(c, l)` is executed, which means `l` is reassigned to the result of calling the function `func_3` with arguments `c` and `l`. Since the exact implementation of `func_3` is not provided, we can only state that `l` is now the result of this function call. All other variables (`c`, `n`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
