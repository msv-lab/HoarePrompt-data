Output State: `c` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is `n - 2 * (number_of_iterations - 1)`, `k` is reduced by the sum of all `i` values minus the number of iterations plus 1, and `l` is the result of repeatedly applying `func_3(c, l)` for each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `c` will be the total number of times the loop ran, which is determined by the value of `n` and how many times the loop condition `range(n, -1, -2)` holds true. The variable `i` will be `n` minus twice the number of iterations minus 2. The variable `k` will be reduced by the sum of all `i` values minus the number of iterations plus 1. Finally, `l` will be the result of repeatedly applying `func_3(c, l)` for each iteration of the loop.
