Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. This involves determining the number of fireworks launched within a certain time frame such that they overlap in visibility.

2. **Key Points**:
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

3. **Current Implementation Issues**:
   - The program calculates `mn = min(a, b) + m` which is not relevant to the problem.
   - It checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and handles the case where `a` and `b` are not 1, but this logic is incorrect.
   - The formula `mn // a + mn // b + 1` is also incorrect because it doesn't account for the overlapping visibility period correctly.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time would be the number of intervals within the visibility period `m + 1`.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
   - Determine how many times the LCM fits into the visibility period `m + 1`.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect. Therefore, the program should be revised to correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

Correctness: **False**
