Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Specifically, the logic used to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `a = 3`, `b = 6`, `m = 5`

According to the problem description, the first installation launches fireworks every 3 minutes, and the second installation every 6 minutes. Each firework is visible for 6 minutes (m + 1 = 5 + 1).

- Fireworks from the first installation will be launched at times: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, ...
- Fireworks from the second installation will be launched at times: 0, 6, 12, 18, ...

At time 0, both installations launch fireworks. Both fireworks will be visible from time 0 to time 5. Therefore, at time 0, we should see 2 fireworks simultaneously.

However, the program calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time using the formula `mn // a + mn // b + 1`. This formula does not account for the overlapping visibility period correctly. In this specific case, the program would incorrectly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time as 3 instead of 2.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
