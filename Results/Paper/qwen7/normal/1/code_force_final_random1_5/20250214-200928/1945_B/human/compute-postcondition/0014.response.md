Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
- `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
```

Let's break it down:

1. `mn` is defined as `min(a, b) + m`.
2. The expression `mn // a` performs integer division of `mn` by `a`.
3. The expression `mn // b` performs integer division of `mn` by `b`.
4. The result of the print statement is the sum of these two integer divisions plus 1.

Since `a` and `b` are integers from the input and `m` is also an integer, the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not specified. Therefore, we need to express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b + 1**
