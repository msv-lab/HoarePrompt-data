Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and splits them into variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `t` is still an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the respective values from the input.
