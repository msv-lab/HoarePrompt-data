Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each case.
3. The variable `mn` is calculated as the sum of the minimum of `a` and `b` and `m`. This value is used to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
4. The logic for calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible involves checking if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and handling the edge case where `a` and `b` are not equal to 1.
5. The formula used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible is:
   - If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, the formula is `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the formula is `mn // a + mn // b`.

Given the problem statement and the example, the provided logic appears to correctly implement the solution. The formula accounts for the overlapping visibility period of the fireworks from both installations.

Correctness: **True**
