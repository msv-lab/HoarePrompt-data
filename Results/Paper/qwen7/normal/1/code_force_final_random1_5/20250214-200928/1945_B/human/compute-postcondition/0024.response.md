Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers a, b, and m, where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}. It returns the first integer t such that t is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and the conditions 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18} are satisfied.**

However, since the function signature does not include parameters, the description should reflect that the function is expected to derive the parameters from some external source (like input arguments passed to it) rather than accepting them directly.
