Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, then the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions also remain unchanged.**
