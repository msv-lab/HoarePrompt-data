### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The critical point is to understand when fireworks from both installations overlap in visibility.
   - If `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b`, then the overlaps occur more frequently.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It calculates `mn = min(a, b) + m`.
   - It checks if `m` is a common multiple of `a` and `b` and if `a` and `b` are not 1.
     - If true, it prints `(mn // a) + (mn // b) + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `(mn // a) + (mn // b)`.

4. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic for checking if `m` is a common multiple of `a` and `b` is flawed.
   - The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0` does not correctly determine if `m` is a common multiple of `a` and `b`.
   - The formula `(mn // a) + (mn // b) + 1` and `(mn // a) + (mn // b)` do not account for the overlapping intervals correctly.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we should use the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM of `a` and `b` gives the interval where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
   - We then calculate how many such intervals fit into the visibility period `m`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the LCM of a and b
        l = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of intervals within m
        intervals = (m + l - 1) // l
        # Add the initial simultaneous launch
        total_fireworks = intervals + 1
        print(total_fireworks)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original code has logical errors in determining the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
