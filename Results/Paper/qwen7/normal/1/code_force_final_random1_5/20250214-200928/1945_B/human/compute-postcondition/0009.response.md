Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then the condition remains as is. Otherwise, the condition `(m % a != 0 or m % b != 0 or (a == 1) or (b == 1))` holds true.
