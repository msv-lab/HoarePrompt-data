Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split.
- `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`.

We need to determine the value of `mn // a + mn // b` and print it.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. `mn` is defined as `min(a, b) + m`.
   - Here, `min(a, b)` returns the smaller of `a` and `b`.
   - Adding `m` to this minimum gives us `mn`.

2. We need to compute `mn // a + mn // b`.
   - `mn // a` means integer division of `mn` by `a`.
   - `mn // b` means integer division of `mn` by `b`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical result. However, we can express the output in terms of these variables.

Thus, the output will be the result of the expression `mn // a + mn // b`, where `mn = min(a, b) + m`.

Output: **mn // a + mn // b (where mn = min(a, b) + m)**
