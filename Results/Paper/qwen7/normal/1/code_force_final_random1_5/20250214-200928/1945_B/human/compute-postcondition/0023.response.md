Output State: **All variables `i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `mn` are updated according to their respective final values after the loop completes.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is the input integer representing the number of iterations. Variables `a`, `b`, and `m` will hold the last set of values entered by the user for each iteration. Similarly, `mn` will store the final calculated value for the last iteration, which is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`. The conditions within the loop do not modify these variables; they only print values based on the current state of `a`, `b`, and `m`. Therefore, the output state reflects the completion of the loop with all relevant variables updated to their final values.
