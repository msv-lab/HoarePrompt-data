Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, and `dp` is a boolean value determined by `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will reach the value of `n`. The condition in the loop `for i in range(1, n)` ensures that `i` starts from 1 and increments until it reaches `n-1`. Since the loop body does not change the value of `n` or the `arr` list, `n` remains the length of `arr` minus 1. The variable `dp` is updated in each iteration based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. After all iterations, `dp` will hold the final boolean value resulting from the last evaluation of this condition.
