Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, `n` is len(arr) - 1, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is set to True.**

Explanation: The code sets `n` to the length of the list `arr` minus one. This means `n` now holds the index of the first zero in the list `arr`, since the list is sorted in descending order followed by 0. The other variables (`tc`, `arr`, and `dp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
