Output State: **`tc` is equal to `tc` - 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, and `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 and `len(arr)` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The variable `tc` is decremented by 1, making it equal to its original value minus 1. The variables `i`, `dp`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the given code snippet.
