Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is True.**

The code initializes the variable `dp` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `tc`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
