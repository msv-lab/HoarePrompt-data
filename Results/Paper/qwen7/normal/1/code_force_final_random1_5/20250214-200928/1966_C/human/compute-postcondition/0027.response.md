Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The condition for the loop is `1 <= i < n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `dp` is `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not dp`.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `len(arr)` must be greater than 2.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts from `1` and increments `i` by `1` each time.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `3`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `1 <= i < n`.
   - Since `i` is now `3`, we need to check if `3 < n`.
   - From the current state, `n` is `len(arr) - 1` and `len(arr)` must be greater than 2.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 (since `len(arr) - 1 >= 2` implies `len(arr) >= 3`).

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `tc` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to `3`.
   - `dp` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `dp` is `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not dp`.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 and `len(arr)` must be greater than 2.

**Answer:**
State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `dp` is `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not dp`, and `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 and `len(arr)` must be greater than 2**.
