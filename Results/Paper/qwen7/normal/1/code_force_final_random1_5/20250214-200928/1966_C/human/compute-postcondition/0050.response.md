Output State: `tc` is `0`; `i` is `n`; `dp` is a boolean value determined by the final iteration's condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `tc` will be reduced to `0` because it starts as `tc` and decreases by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop ends before incrementing `i` again. The value of `dp` will be the result of the final condition check in the loop, which is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` (since `arr` is extended with a `0` and `n` is set to `len(arr) - 1`).
