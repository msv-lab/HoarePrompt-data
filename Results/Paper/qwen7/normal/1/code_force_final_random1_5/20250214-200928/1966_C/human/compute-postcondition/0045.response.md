Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, and `dp` is a boolean value determined by the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will reach the value of `n` (which is the second-to-last index of the list `arr` since `arr` is zero-indexed). The variable `dp` will retain the final boolean value determined by the last iteration of the loop, specifically by the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1`.
