The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `tc` is an input integer, and the precondition is that `tc` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq tc \leq 10^4\). For the loop to execute the first time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

Since the precondition already ensures that `tc` is a positive integer, no adjustment is necessary as long as the precondition holds true.

State: **`tc` is an input integer, and the precondition that `tc` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq tc \leq 10^4\) remains valid.**
