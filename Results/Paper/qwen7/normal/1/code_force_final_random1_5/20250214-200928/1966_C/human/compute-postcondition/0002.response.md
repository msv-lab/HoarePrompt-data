Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, and `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The precondition that `tc` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq tc \leq 10^4\) remains valid. The value of `tc` is not affected by the code, and the value of `n` is the integer input provided by the user.
