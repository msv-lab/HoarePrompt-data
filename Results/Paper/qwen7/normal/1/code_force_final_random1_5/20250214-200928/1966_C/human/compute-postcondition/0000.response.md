Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, and the precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each pile i, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5` remains valid.**

The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tc`. This changes the value of `tc` but does not affect the values of `t` or the list of integers for each test case. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range and the structure of the test cases remain unchanged.
