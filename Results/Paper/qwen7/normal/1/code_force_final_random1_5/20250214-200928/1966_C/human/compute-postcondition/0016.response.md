The loop head is `while tc > 0:`. This means the loop can execute as long as `tc` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` is `tc - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

Let's break down the adjustments needed:

1. The variable `tc` is the only one in the loop head that can be adjusted.
2. Since `tc` was `tc - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `tc` is greater than 0.

State: **`tc` must be greater than 0**
