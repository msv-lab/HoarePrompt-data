Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, and `dp` is a boolean value determined by `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `dp` variable based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the condition checks `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1`. The value of `dp` is set to `True` if the condition is met, otherwise it remains `False`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
