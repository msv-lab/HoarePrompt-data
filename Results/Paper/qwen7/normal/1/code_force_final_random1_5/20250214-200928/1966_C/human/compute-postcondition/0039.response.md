Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, inclusive. This means `i` will take values from `1` up to `n-1`.

3. **Check the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `1` at the start of the loop.

4. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue executing.

5. **Consider the given state before the loop**: 
   - `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `arr` is a list of integers in descending order followed by 0.
   - `dp` is True.

6. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to `1`.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is less than `n` for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1**
