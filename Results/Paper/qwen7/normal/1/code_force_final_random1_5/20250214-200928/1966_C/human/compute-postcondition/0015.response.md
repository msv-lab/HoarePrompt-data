Output State: **`tc` is `tc - 1`; `i` is `n-1`; `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not (arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not (arr[n-3] - arr[n-2] > 1 or not ... (arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not arr[0] - arr[1] > 1) ... ))`**.

Explanation: The variable `tc` is decremented by 1, making it `tc - 1`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at `n-1` because the code snippet does not modify it further. The variable `dp` retains its original value as the code snippet does not alter it.
