Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for c in custos:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `c` and `custos`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the list `custos` that have not been iterated over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `c` must be in the list `custos`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the list `custos`, the variable `c` will take the next value from the list `custos`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `custos` must still contain at least one element that has not been iterated over.
   - Given that `c` must be in `custos`, it means `custos` is not empty at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `y` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `custos` must still contain at least one element.
   - `c` will be the next element in the list `custos`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, and `y` is 0, `c` is the next element in the list `custos`**
