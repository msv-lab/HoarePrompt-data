Output State: **`y` is 1, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, the current value of `custo` is `a_values[0] + b_values[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any of the existing variables (`y`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `custo`). It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the variables retain their initial states, and the break statement is noted.
