Output State: **`y` is 0; `a_values` is an empty list; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside, if any. The values of `y`, `a_values`, and `custo` remain unchanged.
