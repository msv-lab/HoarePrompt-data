Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `v`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `v` in the range from `na_frente` to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `v` starts from `na_frente` and decreases until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Conditions**:
   - If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`:
     - `v` will decrease by 1 in the next iteration.
   - If `v` is greater than `pos_final`:
     - `v` will decrease by 1 in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `v` decreases by 1 in each iteration, `v` will be `v - 1` in the next iteration.
   - `na_frente` and `pos_final` will both decrease by 1 in the next iteration.

5. **Construct the New State**:
   - `v` will be `v - 1`.
   - `na_frente` will be `na_frente - 1`.
   - `pos_final` will be `pos_final - 1`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `total`, `c`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final` are integers.
- The values of `total`, `c`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final` are not specified in the example but will change based on the loop body execution.

Since we need to focus on the loop head variables and their changes:
- `v` will be `v - 1`.
- `na_frente` will be `na_frente - 1`.
- `pos_final` will be `pos_final - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`**
