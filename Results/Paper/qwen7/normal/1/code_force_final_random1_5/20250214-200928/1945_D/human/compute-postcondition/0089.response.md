Postcondition: `total` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers, `best` is the minimum value between `best` (initially 1000000000) and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is set to `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
