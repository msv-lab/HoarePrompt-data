Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `y`, `a_values`, and `b_values`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
