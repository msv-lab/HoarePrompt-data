Postcondition: `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, and `custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y] >= b_values[y]`, where `y` is within the range defined by `range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)` with `y` decreased by 1.
