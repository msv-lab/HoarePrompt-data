Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `y` will be set to 0, `a_values` will be a list containing all the integer values of `y` from `max_p - 1` down to 1, and `b_values` will also be a list containing the same integer values. The variable `custo` will be the sum of all elements in `a_values` and `b_values` based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, `custo` will be incremented by `b_values[y]` if the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is true, otherwise, it will be incremented by `a_values[y]`. If `y` reaches 1 and the condition is met, `custo` will additionally include `a_values[0]`.

In simpler terms, `y` will be 0, `a_values` and `b_values` will both contain the integers from `max_p - 1` to 1 in descending order, and `custo` will be the sum of certain elements from `a_values` and `b_values` as per the given conditions within the loop.
