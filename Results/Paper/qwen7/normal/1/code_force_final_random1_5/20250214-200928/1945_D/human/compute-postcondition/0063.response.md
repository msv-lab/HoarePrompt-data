Output State: **`total` contains the minimum cumulative cost calculated by the loop, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is 0, `pos_final` is 0, and `v` is -1.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `v` will have been decremented until it reaches -1 (since the loop starts at `na_frente` and decrements `v` by 1 in each iteration). The loop updates `total` based on the conditions provided, ensuring that `total` holds the minimum possible cumulative cost. All other variables (`c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`) are reset to 0 as they are decremented in each iteration of the loop.
