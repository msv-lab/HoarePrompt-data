Output State: **`total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `c` remains unchanged, `na_frente` remains unchanged, `pos_final` remains unchanged, `v` remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its current value, while the values of `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `v` remain the same as they were before the code was executed.
