Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = 10 ** 12
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` contains the minimum cumulative cost calculated by the loop, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is 0, `pos_final` is 0, and `v` is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final state of the loop will be as follows: `total` will be the sum of the minimum cost path from `na_frente` to `pos_final` considering both `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. `na_frente` will be -1, `c` will be 1, `pos_final` will be the input integer minus 1, `v` will be -1 - (the length of `custo_pra_frente`), and `best` will be the minimum cumulative cost found during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `na_frente` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -1 (since the loop decrements `v` from `na_frente` to 0, and then continues until it reaches -1), `c` is 2, `v` is -1 minus the length of `custo_pra_frente`, `total` is the sum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration of the loop, and `best` is the minimum value between `best` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` whenever `v <= pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `na_frente` will be an input integer minus 1, `v` will be -1 (indicating the loop has completed all its iterations), `c` will remain 2, and `v` will be -1 minus the length of `custo_pra_frente`. The variable `total` will hold the accumulated cost based on the conditions specified within the loop, and `best` will store the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` when `v <= pos_final` and the condition `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is met during any iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
