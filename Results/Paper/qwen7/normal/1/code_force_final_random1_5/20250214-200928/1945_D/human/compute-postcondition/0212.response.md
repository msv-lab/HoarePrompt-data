Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `y` and the expression `range(max_p - 1, 0, -1)`. This means `y` will take on integer values starting from `max_p - 1` down to `0`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `y`**: Since `y` is being iterated over using `range(max_p - 1, 0, -1)`, the initial value of `y` before the loop starts should be `max_p - 1`.

3. **List Initialization**: The problem states that after the loop completes, `a_values` and `b_values` will contain all the integer values of `y` from the start to the end of the loop. Therefore, `a_values` and `b_values` should be initialized as empty lists before the loop starts.

4. **Final State of `y`**: After the loop completes, `y` will be set to the last element of the list `b`. Since `b` is appending the integer value of `y` in each iteration, the last element of `b` will be the smallest value of `y`, which is `0`.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `y` should be initialized to `max_p - 1`.
- `a_values` should be an empty list.
- `b_values` should be an empty list.
- `y` will be set to `0` after the loop completes.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `y` will be set to `0` after the loop completes**.
