Output State: **`total` is 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 1, `pos_final` is `pos_final` - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from another input split and mapped to integers, `best` is 10000000000**

Explanation: The line `best = 10 ** 12` assigns the value `10000000000` (which is `10 ** 12`) to the variable `best`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
