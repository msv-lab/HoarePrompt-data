You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n are lists of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for c in range(cases):
        na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
        
        custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        na_frente -= 1
        
        pos_final -= 1
        
        total = 0
        
        best = 10 ** 12
        
        for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
            if v <= pos_final:
                if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                    best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                    total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                else:
                    total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
            elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        
        print(best)
        
    #State: Output State: `na_frente` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -1 (indicating the loop has completed all its iterations), `c` is 10000 (the value of `cases` minus 1), and `total` holds the accumulated cost based on the conditions specified within the loop. The variable `best` will store the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` when `v <= pos_final` and the condition `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is met during any iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `na_frente` will be the input integer minus 1, `v` will be -1 indicating the loop has completed, `c` will be the original input integer `cases` minus 1, and `total` will contain the minimum cumulative cost calculated by the loop. `best` will hold the lowest cumulative cost found during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and two lists a and b of length n (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). The function returns a result based on the given inputs for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
