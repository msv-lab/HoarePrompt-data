Output State: **`total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from another input split and mapped to integers, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` initially, and the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total` by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition involving `best` and the comparison between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` also remains valid as per the initial postcondition.
