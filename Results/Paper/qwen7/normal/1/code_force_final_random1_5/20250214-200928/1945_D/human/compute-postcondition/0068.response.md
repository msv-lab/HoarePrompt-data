Output State: **`total` contains the minimum cumulative cost calculated by the loop, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. The values of the other variables (`total`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `v`) remain unchanged.
