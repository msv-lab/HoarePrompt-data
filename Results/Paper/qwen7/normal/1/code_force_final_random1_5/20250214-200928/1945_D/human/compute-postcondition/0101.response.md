Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `v` and `na_frente`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `v = na_frente` to `v = -1` in reverse order.

3. **Determine the New Value of `v`**: Since the loop is iterating in reverse, the new value of `v` will be `v - 1` from the previous iteration.

4. **Check the New Value of `v`**:
   - If `v` is still within the range defined by `na_frente` to `-1`, the loop will continue.
   - If `v` becomes less than `-1`, the loop will terminate.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `v` will be decreased by 1.
   - `na_frente` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

Given the initial conditions:
- `total` is 0
- `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1
- `c` is 1
- `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1
- `v` is -1
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers

After the first iteration where `v` is -1, the next value of `v` will be `-1 - 1 = -2`. However, since the loop condition is `v` ranging from `na_frente` to `-1`, `v` cannot go below `-1`.

Therefore, the loop will terminate after the first iteration because `v` is already at its lower limit.

However, to answer the question based on the loop head variables and the requirement to adjust the states for the next iteration (even though it won't happen here), we proceed as follows:

- `v` will be adjusted to `-1 - 1 = -2`, but since this is out of the loop range, the loop will not execute again.
- `na_frente` remains unchanged.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration (though it won't occur) are:

State: **`total` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -2, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers**
