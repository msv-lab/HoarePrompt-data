Based on the initial state provided:

- `na_frente` will be -1
- `c` will be 1
- `pos_final` will be the input integer minus 1
- `v` will be -1 minus the length of `custo_pra_frente`
- `best` will be the minimum cumulative cost found during the loop execution

The `print(best)` statement will output the minimum cumulative cost found during the loop execution.

Output: **best (where best is the minimum cumulative cost found during the loop execution)**
