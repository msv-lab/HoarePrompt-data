Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 1, `pos_final` is `pos_final` - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from another input split and mapped to integers.**

The code `pos_final -= 1` decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
