Postcondition: `total` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -2, and `best` is `custo_pra_passar_b[-2]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then the condition is met and no changes are made to `total`, `na_frente`, `c`, `pos_final`, `v`, or `best`.
