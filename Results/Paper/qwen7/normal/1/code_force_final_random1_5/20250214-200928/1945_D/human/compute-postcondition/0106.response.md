Output State: **`total` is 0 + `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -2, and `best` remains unchanged if `best` is greater than or equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `total` by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value, which is 0. All other variables (`na_frente`, `c`, `pos_final`, `v`, and `best`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
