Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `a_values` will be a list containing all the integer values of `y` from the start to the end of the loop, `b_values` will also be a list containing all these integer values since it appends the integer value of `y` in each iteration, and `y` will be set to the last element of the list `b` after the loop completes.**

In simpler terms, after the loop runs through all its iterations, `a_values` and `b_values` will both contain a list of all the integer values of `y` that were used in the loop, starting from the highest value down to the lowest. The variable `y` will hold the value of the last element in the list `b`.
