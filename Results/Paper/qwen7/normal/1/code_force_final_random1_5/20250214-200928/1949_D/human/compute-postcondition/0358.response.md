Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `nx` is a string.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is at least 4.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

5. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `j` is 1.

6. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from 1 to 2.

7. **State Adjustment**: We need to update the state such that `j` is now 2. The other variables (`nx`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is `n`, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 4**.
