Output State: **`nx` is either 'SF' or 'FF' plus the value of `xx[i][3]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 4, and `j` is 5**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by concatenating 'F' to its current value. Since `nx` was initially either 'S' or 'F' plus the value of `xx[i][3]`, after adding 'F', `nx` will be either 'SF' or 'FF' plus the value of `xx[i][3]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
