Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on analyzing a square grid of size n x n, where n is an integer between 2 and 24. Each cell in the grid contains either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?', or '.' (no transition video specified). The function ensures that at most half of the cells have their transition videos already decided. Based on this grid, the function determines and returns a specific value or state.**

Note: The exact nature of the return value (e.g., a boolean, a string, etc.) is not specified in the given information, so the functionality focuses on the process of analyzing the grid.
