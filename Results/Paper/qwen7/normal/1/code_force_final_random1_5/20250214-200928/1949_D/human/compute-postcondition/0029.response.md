Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\); `x` is an input string; `j` is 3; `a[i]` is 2 if `i` was 1 before the increment, otherwise `a[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is either 1 or 2, if `i` was 1 before the increment, `a[1]` becomes 2 (since it starts at 1). If `i` was 2 before the increment, `a[2]` becomes 1 (since it starts at 0). The values of `n`, `x`, `j`, and `b[1]` or `b[2]` remain unchanged.
