Output State: **`nx` is a string equal to its previous value plus 'F', `i` is 4, `j` is 3, and `n` is at least 4.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the string `'F'` to the end of `nx`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `nx` becomes the previous value of `nx` plus `'F'`, while `i` remains 4, `j` remains 3, and `n` is still at least 4.
