Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and neither `i` is in `sa[:n // 4]` nor `j` is in `sa[:n // 4]`**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. Initially, `nx` is an empty string, so after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'S'. The values of `i`, `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the conditions about `i` and `j` relative to `sa` remain unchanged.
