Postcondition: `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `n` is at least 4, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is either not '?' or '?'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is set to 'xx[i][j - 1]'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, otherwise `nx` is 'F'.
