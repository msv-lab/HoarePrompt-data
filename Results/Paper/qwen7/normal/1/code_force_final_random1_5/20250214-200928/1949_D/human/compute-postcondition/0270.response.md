Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` remains the same, `xx` contains `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are lists where `a[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'F' at the `j-th` position across all inputs and `b[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'S' at the `j-th` position across all inputs, `sa` is a list containing all integers from `1` to `i-1` (inclusive) that satisfy the condition `a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing all integers from `1` to `i-1` (inclusive) that satisfy the condition `b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be incremented to `n + 1`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n`, and for each iteration, it checks if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. If both conditions are met, the integer `i` is appended to `sb`. Since the loop runs `n` times, `sb` will contain all integers from `1` to `n` that meet the specified condition, and `sa` will be empty because no element satisfies the condition `a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0` within the given constraints. Therefore, `sa` will be an empty list, and the length of `sa` will always be less than the length of `sb`, which will be `n`.
