Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `nx` is an empty string.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means `j` will take values from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The variable `j` will start at 1 (since the loop starts from 1).
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `nx` is not used in the loop and its state does not need to be adjusted.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - `j` should be 1 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
