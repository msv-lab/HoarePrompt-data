Output State: **`j` is 3, `nx` is 'F', `n` is greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` is not defined before this line, it is assumed to be an empty string. After appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'F'. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
