Based on the initial state provided:

- `nx` is a string.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `n+1`, where `n` is at least 4.

Given these conditions, let's break down the print statement:

- The value of `i` is explicitly given as 0.
- The value of `j` is `n+1`. Since `n` is at least 4, `j` will be at least 5. However, the specific value of `j` does not affect the print statement because only `nx` is being printed.

Therefore, the print statement will simply output the string stored in `nx`.

Output: **nx**
