Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and `n` is now set to the integer value entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, the new value of `n` will still satisfy this condition. All other variables remain unchanged.
