Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), `x` is an input string, and the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'S'.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1, after executing the code, `i` becomes 2. The values of `n`, `x`, and the character at index `j-1` of `x` remain unchanged.
