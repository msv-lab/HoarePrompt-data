Output State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F' plus `xx[i][1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code updates `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j-1]` to its current value. Given that `j` is 2, `xx[i][j-1]` translates to `xx[i][1]`. Since `nx` is initially either 'S' or 'F', the updated value of `nx` will be the original value of `nx` plus `xx[i][1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
