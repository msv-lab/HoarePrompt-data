Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `nx` is an empty string, `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`. Additionally, either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after appending 'S', `nx` becomes 'S'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
