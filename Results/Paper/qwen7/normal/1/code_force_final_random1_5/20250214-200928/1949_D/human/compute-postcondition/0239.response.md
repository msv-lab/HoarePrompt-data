Output State: **`nx` is either 'FS' or 'SS', `j` is in the range from `1` to `n/4`.**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by concatenating 'S' to its current value. Since `nx` was either 'F' or 'S', after adding 'S', `nx` can now be either 'FS' or 'SS'. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it is within the range from `1` to `n/4`.
