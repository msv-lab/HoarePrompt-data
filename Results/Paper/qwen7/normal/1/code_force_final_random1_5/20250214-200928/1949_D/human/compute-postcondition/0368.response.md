Output State: **`nx` is 'S' concatenated with the original string value of `nx`, `i` is 4, `j` is 3, and `n` is at least 4.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the string `'S'` to `nx`. Since the initial state of `nx` is a string, appending `'S'` to it results in `nx` becoming `'S'` concatenated with the original string value of `nx`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
