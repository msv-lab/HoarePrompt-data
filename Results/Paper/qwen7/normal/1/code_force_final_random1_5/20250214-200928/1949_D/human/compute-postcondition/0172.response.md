Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `nx` is a string containing 'S' appended to whatever was originally in `nx` before.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the string `'S'` to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is an empty string or already contains some string. After executing the code, `nx` will have `'S'` appended to it. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
