Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `a[1]` is `i + 1`; `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\); `x` is an input string; `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Since `i` can be either 1 or 2, `a[1]` will be `i + 1`. If `i` is 1, then `a[1]` becomes 2; if `i` is 2, then `a[1]` becomes 3. The values of `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
