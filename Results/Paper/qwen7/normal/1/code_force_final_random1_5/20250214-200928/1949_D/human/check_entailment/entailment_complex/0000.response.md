Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires generating a complete transition video plan ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type occur for any permutation of scenarios. Given that at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are already decided, the remaining ones need to be filled in such a way that the constraint is satisfied.

2. **Analyze the Provided Code**:
   - The code initializes arrays `a` and `b` to count the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' respectively in each column.
   - It reads the input and updates these counts.
   - It then categorizes columns into `sa` (more 'F' than 'S') and `sb` (more 'S' than 'F').
   - Depending on the lengths of `sa` and `sb`, it decides how to fill the remaining '?' values with 'F' or 'S'.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The logic for filling '?' values ensures that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S' is met. This is done by prioritizing the filling of '?' values in a way that balances the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions.
   - The approach seems to ensure that the distribution of 'F' and 'S' is balanced, which is crucial for meeting the constraint.

4. **Verification**:
   - The code handles the constraints correctly by ensuring that the balance between 'F' and 'S' is maintained.
   - The logic for filling '?' values is sound and follows the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to generate a valid transition video plan.

Correctness: **True**
