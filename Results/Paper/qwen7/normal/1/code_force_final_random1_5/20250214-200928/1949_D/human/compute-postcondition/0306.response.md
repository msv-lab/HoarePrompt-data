Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`, meaning `i` ranges from `1` to `n + 1`.
3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `nx` is a string consisting of 'S' and 'F'.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` must be at least 3.
   - `j` is 3 after the loop completes.

4. **Check if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Currently, `i` is `n + 1`, so the loop cannot execute again because `i` is already equal to `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is already `n + 1`, it cannot be incremented further within the loop.
   - The value of `i` remains `n + 1`.
   - The value of `n` does not change as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `j` remains `3` as it is not mentioned to be changed in the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`nx` is a string consisting of 'S' and 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 3, and `j` is 3**
