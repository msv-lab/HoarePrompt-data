Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `n` is at least 4, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, and either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'S'. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and the condition about `xx[i][j - 1]` and the quarters of `sb` remain unchanged.
