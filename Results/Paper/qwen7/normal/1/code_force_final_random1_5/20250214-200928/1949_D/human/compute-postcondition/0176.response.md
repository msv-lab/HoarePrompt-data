Postcondition: `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. If `xx[i][1]` is not '?', then `nx` is equal to `nx` plus `xx[i][1]`. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'F' if `i` is in the first quarter of list `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of list `sa`, and 'S' appended to whatever was originally in `nx` before otherwise.
