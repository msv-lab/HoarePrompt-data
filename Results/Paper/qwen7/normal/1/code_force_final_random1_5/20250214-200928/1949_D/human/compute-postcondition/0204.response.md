Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `nx` is either equal to `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', or 'F' or 'S' if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition is `for j in range(1, n + 1)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 2.
   - Therefore, `j` must be 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `nx` remains as it was (either `xx[i][j - 1]` or 'F' or 'S').
   - `j` changes to 2.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `nx` is either equal to `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', or 'F' or 'S' if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.
