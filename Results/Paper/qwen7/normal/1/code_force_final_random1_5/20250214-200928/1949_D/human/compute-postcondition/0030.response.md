Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\); `x` is an input string; `j` is 4; `a[3]` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 3, `a[3]` is incremented by 1. Since `a[3]` was initially 3 (as per the initial state where `a[i]` is 2 if `i` was 1 before the increment, otherwise `a[i]` is 1, and here `i` is 3), after the increment, `a[3]` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
