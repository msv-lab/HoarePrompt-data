Postcondition: `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the string `xx[i][j - 1]` concatenated with the previous value of `nx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is either 'S' or 'F' depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.
