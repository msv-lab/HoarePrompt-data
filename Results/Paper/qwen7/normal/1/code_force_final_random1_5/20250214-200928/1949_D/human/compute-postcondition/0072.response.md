Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `j` will be between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0. For each index `j` from 1 to `n` (inclusive), if the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'F', then `a[j]` will be incremented by 1. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` will be incremented by 1 and `b[i]` will also be incremented by 1. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then no changes are made to `a[j]`, `b[j]`, and `b[i]`.
