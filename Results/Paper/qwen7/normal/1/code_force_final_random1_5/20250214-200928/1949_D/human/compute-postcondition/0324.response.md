Output State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F' plus the value of `xx[i][3]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 4, and `j` is 4.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Given that `j` is 4, `xx[i][j - 1]` translates to `xx[i][3]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `nx` now holds its original value ('S' or 'F') plus the value of `xx[i][3]`.
