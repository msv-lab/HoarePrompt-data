Postcondition: `j` must be between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0, and the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is not 'F'. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is increased by 1 and `b[i]` is increased by 1. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is not 'S', then no changes are made to `b[j]` and `b[i]`.
