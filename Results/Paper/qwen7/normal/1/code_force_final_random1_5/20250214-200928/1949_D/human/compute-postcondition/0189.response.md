State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `nx` is an empty string, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. The loop starts with `j` initialized to 1 and runs as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 because the loop starts with `j` set to 1.
4. The initial value of `j` is 1, so the loop can start executing.
5. The variable `nx` is not used in the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` being 1, `n` being greater than or equal to 1 (to ensure the loop can start), and `nx` remaining an empty string.
