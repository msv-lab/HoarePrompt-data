The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, the value of `b[3]` will be incremented. The initial value of `b[3]` depends on the value of `i`. If `i` was 1 before the increment, `b[1]` was 4, and since `b[1]` and `b[3]` are different indices, `b[3]` would remain unchanged and still be 4. If `i` was not 1 (meaning `i` was 2), then `b[2]` was 4, and again, since `b[2]` and `b[3]` are different indices, `b[3]` would remain unchanged and still be 4.

Therefore, the value of `b[3]` does not change, and all other variables remain as they were.

Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\); `x` is an input string; `j` is 3; `b[1]` is 4 if `i` was 1 before the increment, otherwise `b[2]` is 4; `b[3]` is 4.**
