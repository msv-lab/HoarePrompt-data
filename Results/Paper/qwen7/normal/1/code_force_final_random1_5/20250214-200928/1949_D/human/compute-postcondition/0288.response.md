Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` must be at least 1
- `j` is 1
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the string `xx[i][j - 1]` concatenated with the previous value of `nx`.
- Otherwise, `nx` is either 'S' or 'F' depending on whether `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.
- If both conditions are false, then `nx` is 'F'.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `j`.
2. **Initial Value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n + 1`.

Given that `j` starts at 1 and the loop condition is `j < n + 1`, the loop will execute once more if `j` is incremented to 2 (since `j` is initially 1).

### Adjusting the States:
- **`j`**: Since the loop will run one more time, `j` will be incremented from 1 to 2.
- **`nx`**: The value of `nx` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `nx` within the loop.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head and its value (`n + 1`) does not change during the loop execution.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head and its value does not change during the loop execution.

### Final State:
- `nx` remains the same as the previous value.
- `j` is incremented to 2.
- `i` remains `n + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2**
