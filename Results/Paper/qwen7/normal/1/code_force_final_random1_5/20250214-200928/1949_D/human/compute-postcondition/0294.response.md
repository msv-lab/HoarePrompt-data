Postcondition: `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2. If `xx[i][1]` is not '?', then `nx` is either 'S' or 'F' plus `xx[i][1]`. Otherwise, `nx` remains either 'SF' or 'FS', and `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2. If either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, then `nx` remains either 'SF' or 'FS'. Otherwise, `nx` remains 'SF'.
