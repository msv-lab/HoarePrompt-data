Output State: **`nx` is either 'FFF' or 'SFF' or 'FFS' or 'SSF', and `j` is in the range from `2` to `n/4`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` could initially be 'FF', 'SF', 'FS', or 'SS', appending 'F' to each of these results in 'FFF', 'SFF', 'FFS', or 'SSF'. The value of `j` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
