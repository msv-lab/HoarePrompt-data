Postcondition: `nx` is either 'S' concatenated with the original string value of `nx`, or "nxF", `i` is `n`, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 4. If `i` is found in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is found in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S' concatenated with the original string value of `nx`. Otherwise, `nx` is "nxF".
