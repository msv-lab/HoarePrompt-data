Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `nx` is an empty string, `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`. Additionally, `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'F'. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, `xx`, `sb`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
