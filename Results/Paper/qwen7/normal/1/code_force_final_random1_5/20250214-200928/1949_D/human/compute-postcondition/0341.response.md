Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nx` is a string of length `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n+1`.
   - `n` is at least 4.
   - `j` is `n+1`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` needs to be set to `n` (the next value before it reaches `n + 1`).
   - `n` remains the same since it is not being modified within the loop head.
   - `j` is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `nx` remains a string of length `n-1`.
   - `i` is now `n`.
   - `n` is still at least 4.
   - `j` remains `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`nx` is a string of length n-1, `i` is n, `n` is at least 4, and `j` is n+1**.
