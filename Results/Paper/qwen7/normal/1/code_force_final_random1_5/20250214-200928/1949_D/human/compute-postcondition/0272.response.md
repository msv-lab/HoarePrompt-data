Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` remains the same, `nx` is an empty string**

Explanation: The code assigns an empty string to the variable `nx`. This does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `i` and `n` from the initial state, and adds that `nx` is now an empty string.
