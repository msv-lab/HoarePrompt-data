Output State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is `j`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `j`**

Explanation: The line `nx = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `nx`. This operation does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. Therefore, `i` remains equal to `j`, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to `j`.
