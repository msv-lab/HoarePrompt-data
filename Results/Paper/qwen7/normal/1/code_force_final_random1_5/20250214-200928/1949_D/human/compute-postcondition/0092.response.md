Output State: **`x` is an array, `j` is `j + 1`, `b[i]` is increased by 1, `b[j]` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Before this line, `j` was `j + 1`, so `b[j]` corresponds to the element in the array `b` at the index `j`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
