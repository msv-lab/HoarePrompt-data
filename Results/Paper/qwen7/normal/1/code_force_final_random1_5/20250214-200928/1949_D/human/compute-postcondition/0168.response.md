Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `nx` is determined as follows:
- If `xx[i][0]` is not '?', then `nx` is the value of `xx[i][0]`.
- If `xx[i][0]` is '?', and either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4]`, then `nx` is 'F'.
- If `xx[i][0]` is '?', and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, then `nx` is 'S'.
