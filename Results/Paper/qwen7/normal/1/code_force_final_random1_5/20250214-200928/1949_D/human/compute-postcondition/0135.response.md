Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `xx` contains `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are lists where `a[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'F' at the `j-th` position across all inputs and `b[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'S' at the `j-th` position across all inputs, `sa` is a list containing all integers from `1` to `n` where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing all integers from `1` to `n` where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from `1` to `n`. During each iteration, if `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, the integer `i` is appended to `sa`. Similarly, if `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, the integer `i` is appended to `sb`. Since the loop processes all values of `i` from `1` to `n`, `sa` will contain all indices `j` where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, and `sb` will contain all indices `j` where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`.
