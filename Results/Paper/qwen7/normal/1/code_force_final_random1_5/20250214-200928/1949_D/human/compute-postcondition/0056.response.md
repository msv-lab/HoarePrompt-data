Output State: **`j` is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0, `b[i]` is incremented by 1**.

The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Since `j` and `n` are not directly involved in this operation, their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `j` is still between 1 and `n` inclusive, and `n` is still greater than 0. The value of `b[i]` is updated to its original value plus 1.
