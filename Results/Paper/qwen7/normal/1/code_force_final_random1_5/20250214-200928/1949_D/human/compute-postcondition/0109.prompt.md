Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, where each element is 0; `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, where each element is 0; `xx` is a list containing one empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = input()
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if x[j - 1] == 'F':
            a[i] += 1
            a[j] += 1
        elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
            b[i] += 1
            b[j] += 1
    xx.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will execute exactly n times, where n is the initial value of the variable n. After all iterations, the value of i will remain as it was initially set (either 1 or 2). The values of a[j] and b[j] will be incremented based on the characters in the string x according to the rules specified in the loop body. Specifically, if a character in x is 'F', a[j] will be incremented, and if it is 'S', b[j] will be incremented, where j ranges from 1 to n. The list xx will now contain the string x.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `j` will be between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0, `xx` is a list containing the list `x`, `a[j]` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'F', `b[j]` is incremented by 1 and `b[i]` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'S', and no changes are made to `a[j]`, `b[j]`, and `b[i]` if the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `xx` now contains the list `[x]`, all other variables and lists (`i`, `j`, `xx`, `x`, `a`, `b`) retain their values as they were after the last iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
