Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` will be between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0, `xx` is a list containing the list `x`, `i` will be `i + 1`, `x` is the input string, and the values of `a[j]`, `b[j]`, and `b[i]` remain unchanged unless the conditions specified are met.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` is an array. If the element at index `j-1` is 'F', then the element at index `i` is incremented by 1, and the element at index `j` is increased by 1. If the element at index `j-1` is either 'S' or 'F', all other elements in the list retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `x` is an array, `j` is `j + 1`. If `x[j - 1]` is equal to 'F', then `a[i]` and `a[j]` are each incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is equal to 'S', then `b[i]` and `b[j]` are each increased by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes are made to `a[i]`, `a[j]`, `b[i]`, and `b[j]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x` is an array, `j` is `j + 2`. If `x[j - 1]` equals 'F', then `a[j]` is increased by 1. If `x[j - 1]` equals 'S', then `b[j]` is increased by 1. There is no change in the array `x` and the value of `j` otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
