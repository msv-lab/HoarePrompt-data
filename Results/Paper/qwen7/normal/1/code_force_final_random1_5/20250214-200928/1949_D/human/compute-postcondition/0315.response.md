Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 4, and `j` is 3, and `xx[i][2]` is `'?'`, and either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'S'. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `xx[i][2]`, and the condition about quarters of `sb` remain unchanged from the initial state.
