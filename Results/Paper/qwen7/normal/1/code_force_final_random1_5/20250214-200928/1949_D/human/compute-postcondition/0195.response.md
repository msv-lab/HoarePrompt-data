Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `nx` is 'F', `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string (`''`), after executing this line, `nx` becomes `'F'`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from their initial states.
