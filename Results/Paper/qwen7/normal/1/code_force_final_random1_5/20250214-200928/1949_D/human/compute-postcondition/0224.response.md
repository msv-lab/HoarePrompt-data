Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `j` and `n`**:
   - From the given information, `i` is equal to `j`.
   - The state before the loop starts mentions that `n` must be greater than or equal to `j`.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - Since `j` is the variable being iterated over in the loop, it should start at 1 (the lower bound of the range).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `j` to ensure the loop can start.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `j` starts at 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to `j`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
