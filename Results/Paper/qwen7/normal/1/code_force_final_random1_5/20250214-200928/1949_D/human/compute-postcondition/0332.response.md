Output State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F' plus the value of `xx[n + 1][4]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 4, and `j` is 5**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` adds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Given that `j` is 5, `j - 1` equals 4. Since `i` is `n + 1`, the value added to `nx` is `xx[n + 1][4]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
