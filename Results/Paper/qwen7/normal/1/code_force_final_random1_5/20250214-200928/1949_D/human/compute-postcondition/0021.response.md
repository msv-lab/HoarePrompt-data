Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `a[1]` is `i + 1`; `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\); `x` is an input string; `j` is 2; `a[2]` is `a[1] + 1`**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, `a[2]` is incremented by 1. Since `a[1]` was previously set to `i + 1`, `a[2]` will now be `a[1] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
