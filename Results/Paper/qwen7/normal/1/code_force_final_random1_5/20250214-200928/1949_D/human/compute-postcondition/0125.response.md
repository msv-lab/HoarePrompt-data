Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `xx` contains `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are lists where `a[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'F' at the `j-th` position across all inputs and `b[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'S' at the `j-th` position across all inputs, `sa` is a list containing `1, 2`, `sb` is a list containing `2`, and if `a[2] > 0` and `b[2] == 0`, then `b[2]` remains unchanged.**
