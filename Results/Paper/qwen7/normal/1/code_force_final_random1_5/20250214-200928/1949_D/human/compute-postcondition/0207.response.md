Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `nx` is 'S', `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` was originally either equal to `xx[i][j - 1]` if it was not '?', or 'F' or 'S' if it was '?'. Given `j` is 2, `xx[i][j - 1]` corresponds to `xx[i][1]`. Since the exact value of `xx[i][1]` is not specified, we consider the two cases:

1. If `xx[i][1]` is not '?', then `nx` was originally equal to `xx[i][1]`. After executing `nx += 'S'`, `nx` becomes `xx[i][1] + 'S'`.
2. If `xx[i][1]` is '?', then `nx` was originally 'F' or 'S'. After executing `nx += 'S'`, `nx` becomes 'FS' or 'SS'.

However, since the problem does not specify which case applies, and to maintain the simplest and most direct interpretation, we assume the most straightforward scenario where `nx` was originally 'S' (as it is the only value given directly without conditions). Thus, `nx` becomes 'SS'. The other variables remain unchanged.
