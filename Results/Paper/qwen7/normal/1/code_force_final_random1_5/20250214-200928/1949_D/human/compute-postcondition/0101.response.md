Output State: **`x` is an array, `j` is `j + 2`, `b[j]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. The value of `j` is updated to `j + 2` before this line of code, but the exact value of `j` is not specified. Therefore, `b[j]` is increased by 1, where `j` is now `j + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
