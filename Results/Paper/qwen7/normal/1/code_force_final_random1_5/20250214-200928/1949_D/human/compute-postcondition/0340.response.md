Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n-1)**

Explanation:
- `nx` is described as a string of length `n-1`. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact content of `nx`, but we know its length.
- `i` and `j` are both set to `n+1`, but these variables are not used in the `print(nx)` statement.
- Therefore, when the `print(nx)` statement is executed, it will print the string `nx`, which is a string of length `n-1`.
