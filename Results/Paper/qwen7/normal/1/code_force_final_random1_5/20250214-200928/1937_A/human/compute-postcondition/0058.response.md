Output State: `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `power` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 3.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` until it is no longer less than `n`. Given the initial conditions and the output states after the first three iterations, we can deduce that `power` will eventually equal `n` after the loop completes. Since the loop increments `power` by 1 each iteration and starts from 1, if `n` is greater than 3, `power` will match `n` after the loop finishes. The variable `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1 with each iteration of the loop, so it will be `n + 1` when the loop ends. However, since the question asks to describe the state of variables in the loop, we focus on `power` matching `n`. The other variables (`n_cases` and `n`) remain as initially described or updated according to the loop's logic, but since they are not directly modified within the loop, their final state is not specified beyond the initial conditions.
