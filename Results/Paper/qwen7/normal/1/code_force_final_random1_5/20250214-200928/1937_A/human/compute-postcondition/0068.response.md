Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the function does some unspecified processing and returns a result based on the values of t and n.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes each test case involving `t` and `n` and returns a specific output for each, though the exact nature of the processing and the return value are not specified in the given information.
