Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n_cases`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(n_cases)` will execute as long as `n_cases` is a non-negative integer. If `n_cases` is zero or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `t` is not directly used in the loop condition, its value does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
   - `n_cases` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n_cases` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 0**
