Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < n`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1 more than its previous value.
   - `power` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**: The loop condition depends on `power` and `n`. Therefore, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `power` and `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`. Since `power` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to ensure that `power` is still less than `n` for the next iteration.
   - We don't know the exact value of `n`, but we know that `n_cases` must be greater than 0. This doesn't directly affect the loop condition but might be relevant for other parts of the program.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `power` must be less than `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 more than its previous value, `power` must be less than `n`**
