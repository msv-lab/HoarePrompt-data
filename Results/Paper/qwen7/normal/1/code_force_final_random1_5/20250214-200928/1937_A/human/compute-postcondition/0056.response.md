Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4, `power` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3**

The code `power += 1` increments the value of `power` by 1. Given that `power` was initially 3, after executing this line, `power` becomes 4. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
