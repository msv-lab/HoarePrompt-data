Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 more than its previous value, `power` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `power += 1` increments the value of `power` by 1. The values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `n_cases` must still be greater than 0, `i` is still 1 more than its previous value, and `power` is increased by 1.
