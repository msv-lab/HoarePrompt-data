Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `power < n`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is `log2(n_cases)` and must be greater than 1.
   - `power` is 2.

3. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `power` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `power` is 2.
   - `n` is `log2(n_cases)` and must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `power` is 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `n_cases` must still be greater than 0 because `n` is derived from `log2(n_cases)` and must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 2 (since `n` is `log2(n_cases)` and must be greater than 2).

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2**
