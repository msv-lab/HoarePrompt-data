Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 more than its previous value, `power` is either equal to `n_cases` or `power - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `n_cases`, `i`, and `power` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n_cases` must still be greater than 0, `i` is still 1 more than its previous value, and `power` is either equal to `n_cases` or `power - 1`. The variable `n` now holds the value of the integer input.
