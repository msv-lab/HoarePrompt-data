Based on the initial state provided:

- `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1 more than its previous value.
- `power` is either equal to `n_cases` or `power - 1`.
- `n` is an input integer.

The print statement simply outputs the number 1. Since no other information is provided about the value of `i`, `power`, or `n`, we do not need to include these in the output description.

Output: **1**
