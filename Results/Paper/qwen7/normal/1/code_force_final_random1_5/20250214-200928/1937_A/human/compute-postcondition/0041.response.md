Based on the initial state provided:

- `n_cases` must be greater than 0, but the value of `n_cases` itself is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- `power` is equal to `power - 1`. Since `power` is being assigned to itself minus 1, and no initial value for `power` is given, let's assume `power` is initially set to some value that allows this assignment to make sense. Given the context, it's reasonable to assume `power` was set to 1 before this line of code, making `power` equal to 0 after this assignment.

So, the expression `2 ** power` will be evaluated with `power` being 0.

Output: **1**
