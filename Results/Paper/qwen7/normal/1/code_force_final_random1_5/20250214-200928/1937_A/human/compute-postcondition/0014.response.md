Output State: `power` is equal to its original value plus 3, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, and `n` is greater than 2.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `power` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration until it is 4 (since it started at 1 and was incremented 3 times). The condition that `n_cases` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and `n` (which is initially set as `log2(n_cases)`) must be greater than 2, as it was after the loop had executed 3 times.
