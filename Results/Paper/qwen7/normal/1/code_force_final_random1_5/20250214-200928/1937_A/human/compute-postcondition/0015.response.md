Output State: `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is log2(n_cases) and must be greater than 2, and `power` is 4.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `n`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `power` is now 4. Since `power` starts from 1 and increases by 1 each iteration, after all iterations, `power` will be equal to its original value (1) plus the number of iterations (3), which is 4. Additionally, for the loop to execute at least 3 times, `n` must be greater than 2, as `n` is log2(`n_cases`) and must be an integer. Therefore, `n_cases` must be greater than 4 (since log2(4) = 2).
