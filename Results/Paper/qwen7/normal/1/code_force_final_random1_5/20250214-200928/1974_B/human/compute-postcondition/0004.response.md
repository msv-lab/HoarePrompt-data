Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with one instance of `char` replaced by `unique_chars[j]`, `char` is a character, and `unique_chars` is a set containing unique characters.**

Explanation: The code replaces all instances of the character `char` in the string `s` with the element `unique_chars[j]`. The variable `char` remains unchanged, and `unique_chars` also remains unchanged as it was not affected by the operation. The string `s` is updated with the replacement.
