Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to decode the string but it contains several logical errors and misunderstandings about the encoding process. Here's why it is incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic Error**: The function `func_1` is intended to decode the string, but it actually re-constructs the auxiliary string `r` instead of performing the decoding. It replaces characters in the encoded string `s` with characters from `unique_chars`, which is not the correct approach for decoding.

2. **Incorrect Decoding Process**: The decoding process should map each character in the encoded string back to its corresponding character in the original auxiliary string `r`. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this mapping.

3. **Reconstruction vs. Decoding**: The function `func_1` constructs `unique_chars` in sorted order and then tries to replace characters in `s` with characters from `unique_chars`, which is not the correct way to decode. Instead, we need to find the position of each character in `unique_chars` and use the mirrored position to get the original character.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly decode the string, we need to follow these steps:
1. Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string `b`.
2. For each character in the encoded string `b`, find its position in `r` and replace it with the character at the mirrored position.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode_string(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def decode_string(s):
    # Step 1: Create a dictionary to map each character to its position in the sorted unique characters
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    char_to_pos = {char: idx for idx, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    
    # Step 2: Decode the string
    decoded_str = []
    for char in s:
        pos = char_to_pos[char]
        mirrored_pos = len(unique_chars) - pos - 1
        decoded_str.append(unique_chars[mirrored_pos])
    
    return ''.join(decoded_str)
```

This corrected program constructs the auxiliary string `r` and uses a dictionary to map each character to its position. Then, it decodes the string by finding the mirrored position and appending the corresponding character.
