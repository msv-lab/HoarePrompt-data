Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not decode the string correctly according to the problem description. The function `func_1` attempts to decode the string but does not reverse the process of encoding as required. Instead of replacing characters based on their position in the auxiliary string `r`, it tries to insert characters into `unique_chars` and replace them, which does not align with the encoding process described.

To decode correctly, we need to construct the auxiliary string `r` and then map each character in the encoded string `b` to its corresponding character in `r`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode_string(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def decode_string(s):
    # Construct the auxiliary string r
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    
    # Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric counterpart
    mapping = {char: r[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    
    # Decode the string
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

This corrected program constructs the auxiliary string `r` and creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart. It then uses this mapping to decode the encoded string `b` correctly.
