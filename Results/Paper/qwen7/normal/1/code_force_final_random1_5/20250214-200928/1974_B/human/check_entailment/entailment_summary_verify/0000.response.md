### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the original program is incorrect and how the provided solution addresses the issue.

#### Original Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an encoded string `s` and attempts to decode it.
   - It constructs a list of unique characters from `s` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It then iterates through each character in `s` and replaces it with the corresponding character from the sorted list of unique characters.
   - However, this approach does not correctly decode the string because it does not reverse the encoding process. The encoding process involves replacing each character with its symmetric counterpart from the auxiliary string `r`, not simply replacing it with the next character in the sorted list.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - To decode correctly, we need to:
     - Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the unique characters of the encoded string `b`.
     - Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
     - Use this mapping to decode the encoded string `b`.

#### Corrected Program Analysis:
1. **Function `decode_string`**:
   - Constructs the auxiliary string `r` from the unique characters of the encoded string `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - Creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
   - Uses this mapping to decode the encoded string `b`.

This corrected approach ensures that the string is decoded correctly according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the provided program and proposed a corrected version. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
