Postcondition: `s` is a modified version of the original string. If `char` is already in `unique_chars`, every occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, `char` becomes the next character in the modified `s`, `unique_chars` contains unique characters from the modified `s`, `j` is decreased by 1, and `i` is increased by 1. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `s` remains unchanged except that `char` is the next character in `s`, `unique_chars` contains unique characters from `s` with `char` inserted at index `i`, `j` is increased by 1, and `i` is increased by 1.
