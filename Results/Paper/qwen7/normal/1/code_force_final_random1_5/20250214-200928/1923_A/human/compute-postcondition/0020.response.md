Output State: **`arr` is the string obtained by joining the input string split by spaces; `n` is the integer input by the user; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`; `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`; `_` is 1; `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code `z = arr[x:n - y]` assigns a substring of `arr` to `z`.
- The substring starts from index `x` and ends just before index `n - y`.
- The values of `arr`, `n`, `y`, `_`, and `x` remain unchanged from their previous states.
- The value of `z` is now the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before index `n - y`.
