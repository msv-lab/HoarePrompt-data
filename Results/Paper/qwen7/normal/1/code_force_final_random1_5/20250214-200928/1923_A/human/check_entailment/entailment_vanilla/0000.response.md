Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string representation of the cells (`arr`).

2. **Processing the String Representation:**
   - The string `arr` is processed by removing spaces and joining the elements directly.
   - This step is unnecessary because the input is already space-separated, and we don't need to join anything.

3. **Finding Positions of Chips:**
   - `x` is set to the index of the first '1' in the string `arr`.
   - `y` is set to the index of the first '1' from the right in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`.

4. **Extracting Relevant Part of the String:**
   - `z` is set to the substring from `x` to `n - y - 1`, which is not correctly calculated. It should be from `x` to `n - y`.

5. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program counts the number of '0's in the substring `z` and prints this count.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Substring Calculation:**
   - The calculation `n - y` is incorrect. It should be `n - 1 - y` to get the correct substring length.

2. **Logic for Minimum Operations:**
   - The logic to find the minimum number of operations to move all chips into a single block is flawed. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of moves required.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        # Correctly calculate the substring
        z = arr[x:n - 1 - y]
        # Count the number of free cells in the relevant part
        print(z.count('0'))

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has logical errors in calculating the substring and counting the free cells. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
