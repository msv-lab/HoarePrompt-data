Output State: **`arr` is the string obtained by joining the input string split by spaces; `n` is the integer input by the user; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`; `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`; `_` is 1; `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr` and assigns it to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `x` is now updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, while `arr`, `n`, `y`, `z`, `_`, and the original value of `x` (before the assignment) are kept as they were.
