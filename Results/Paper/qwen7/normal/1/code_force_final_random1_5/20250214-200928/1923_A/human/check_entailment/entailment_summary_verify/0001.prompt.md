You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n binary values. It then finds the first occurrence of '1' from the start and the end of the binary string, extracts the substring between these occurrences, and counts the number of zeros in this substring. The function prints the count of zeros for each test case and returns nothing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string representation of the cells (`arr`).

2. **Processing the String Representation:**
   - The string `arr` is processed by removing spaces and joining the elements directly.
   - This step is unnecessary because the input is already space-separated, and we don't need to join anything.

3. **Finding Positions of Chips:**
   - `x` is set to the index of the first '1' in the string `arr`.
   - `y` is set to the index of the first '1' from the right in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`.

4. **Extracting Relevant Part of the String:**
   - `z` is set to the substring from `x` to `n - y - 1`, which is not correctly calculated. It should be from `x` to `n - y`.

5. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program counts the number of '0's in the substring `z` and prints this count.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Substring Calculation:**
   - The calculation `n - y` is incorrect. It should be `n - 1 - y` to get the correct substring length.

2. **Logic for Minimum Operations:**
   - The logic to find the minimum number of operations to move all chips into a single block is flawed. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of moves required.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        # Correctly calculate the substring
        z = arr[x:n - 1 - y]
        # Count the number of free cells in the relevant part
        print(z.count('0'))

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has logical errors in calculating the substring and counting the free cells. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
