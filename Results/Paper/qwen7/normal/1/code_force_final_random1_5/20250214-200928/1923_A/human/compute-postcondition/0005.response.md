Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string created by joining the input string split by spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`, `_` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, or `_`. The new variable `y` is assigned the index of the last '1' in the reversed string `arr`.
