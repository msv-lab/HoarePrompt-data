Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a string created by joining the input string split by spaces.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
   - `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`.
   - `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`.
   - `_` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the value of `t`, we need to decrement `t` by 1.
   - All other variables (`n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `_`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` is now `t - 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `arr` remains the same.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `y` remains the same.
   - `z` remains the same.
   - `_` remains 0.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t < 1000, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string created by joining the input string split by spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`, `_` is 0**.
