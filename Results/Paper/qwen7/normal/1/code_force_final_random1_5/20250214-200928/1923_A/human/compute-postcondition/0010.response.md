Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t < 1000, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string obtained by joining the input string split by spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`, `_` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `arr = ''.join(input('').split())` takes the input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and then joins these strings back together without any spaces, effectively creating a new string `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial states.
