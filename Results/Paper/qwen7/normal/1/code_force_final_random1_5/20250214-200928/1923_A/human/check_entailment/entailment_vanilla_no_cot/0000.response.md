Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program expects user input for `t`, `n`, and the sequence of cells containing chips or being free. However, it only takes the input in string format and splits it, which is unnecessary and may lead to incorrect handling of spaces or other characters.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Free Cells**: The logic for finding the positions of the closest free cells to the left and right of the chips is flawed. It uses `arr.find('1')` and `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the indices of the first '1' from the left and right, respectively. This does not account for the optimal movement of chips to form a single block.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Operations**: The program counts the number of '0's (free cells) between the first and last '1' in the string representation of the array. This does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Identify the positions of all chips.
- Calculate the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips to a contiguous block without any free cells between them.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find all positions of chips
        chip_positions = [i + 1 for i, x in enumerate(arr) if x == 1]
        
        # If there's only one chip, no operation is needed
        if len(chip_positions) == 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum number of operations
        min_operations = float('inf')
        for i in range(len(chip_positions)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(chip_positions)):
                operations = max(chip_positions[j] - chip_positions[i] - 1, 0)
                min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)
        
        print(min_operations)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the positions of the chips, calculates the minimum number of operations needed to move them to a contiguous block, and prints the result.
