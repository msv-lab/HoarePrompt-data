Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u` is the first integer from the input decreased by 1, `v` is the second integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing `u` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `u` and `v`. Both `u` and `v` are then decreased by 1. The initial state of `n` being at least 3 and the list `u2vs[v]` containing `u` appended to it remains unchanged except for the new values of `u` and `v`.
