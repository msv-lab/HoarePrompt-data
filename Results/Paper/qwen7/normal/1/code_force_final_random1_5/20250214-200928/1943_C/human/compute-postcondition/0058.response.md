Output State: `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`.

In this final output state, the variable `ops` will contain a series of tuples. Each tuple consists of the value of `c` (which is `path_ba[ci]`) paired with an integer `i` ranging from `0` to the value of `ci`. This means that if `ci` was initially set to some value, say `k`, then after the loop completes, `ops` will contain `k+1` tuples, where the first tuple is `(c, 0)`, the second is `(c, 1)`, and so on, up to `(c, k)`. The other variables (`d`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `c`) will retain their last known values from the loop's final iteration, but their exact values are not specified in the problem statement beyond their roles in determining the length of `path_ba` and the value of `ci`.
