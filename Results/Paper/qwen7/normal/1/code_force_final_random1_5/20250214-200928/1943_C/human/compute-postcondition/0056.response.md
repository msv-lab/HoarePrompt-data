Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < ci + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ops` is a list with an additional tuple `(c, previous_i + 1)` appended to it.
   - This means that `ops` has been modified, but the loop itself does not depend on `ops`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs based on `i` and `ci`, we need to update these variables.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body executed).
   - Therefore, `i` will now be `previous_i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `ci + 1`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
   - `ci` remains unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ops` is a list with an additional tuple `(c, previous_i + 1)` appended to it, `i` is previous_i + 1, `ci` must be greater than or equal to previous_i + 1**.
