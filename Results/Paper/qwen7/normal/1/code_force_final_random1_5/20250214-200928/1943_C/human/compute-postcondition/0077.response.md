Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `ops` is a list of tuples.
   - If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` would contain tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`.
   - However, since the actual `path_ba` is not provided, we follow the alternative definition given: `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, and `ops` is a list containing twelve specific tuples.
   - The twelve tuples are: `((c2, 1), (c2, 2), (c1, 4), (c2, 4), (c1, 6), (c2, 6), (c1, 8), (c2, 8), (c1, 10), (c2, 10), (c1, 12), (c2, 12))`.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 12.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code uses a lambda function to map over the `ops` list and formats each tuple into a string with the format `'x y'` where `x` is `x[0] + 1` and `y` is `x[1]`.
   - The `map` function applies this transformation to each tuple in `ops`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks the resulting iterable into positional arguments for the `print` function.
   - The `sep='\n'` argument ensures that each formatted string is printed on a new line.

3. **Detailed Calculation:**
   - For each tuple `(c, i)` in `ops`, the transformed string will be `f'{c + 1} {i}'`.

Given the twelve tuples in `ops`, let's transform them one by one:
- `((c2, 1))` → `f'{c2 + 1} 1'`
- `((c2, 2))` → `f'{c2 + 1} 2'`
- `((c1, 4))` → `f'{c1 + 1} 4'`
- `((c2, 4))` → `f'{c2 + 1} 4'`
- `((c1, 6))` → `f'{c1 + 1} 6'`
- `((c2, 6))` → `f'{c2 + 1} 6'`
- `((c1, 8))` → `f'{c1 + 1} 8'`
- `((c2, 8))` → `f'{c2 + 1} 8'`
- `((c1, 10))` → `f'{c1 + 1} 10'`
- `((c2, 10))` → `f'{c2 + 1} 10'`
- `((c1, 12))` → `f'{c1 + 1} 12'`
- `((c2, 12))` → `f'{c2 + 1} 12'`

Since the exact values of `c1` and `c2` are not provided, we represent them as `c1` and `c2` respectively.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The printed output will be:
     ```
     c2 + 1 1
     c2 + 1 2
     c1 + 1 4
     c2 + 1 4
     c1 + 1 6
     c2 + 1 6
     c1 + 1 8
     c2 + 1 8
     c1 + 1 10
     c2 + 1 10
     c1 + 1 12
     c2 + 1 12
     ```

Output: **c2 + 1 1  
c2 + 1 2  
c1 + 1 4  
c2 + 1 4  
c1 + 1 6  
c2 + 1 6  
c1 + 1 8  
c2 + 1 8  
c1 + 1 10  
c2 + 1 10  
c1 + 1 12  
c2 + 1 12**
