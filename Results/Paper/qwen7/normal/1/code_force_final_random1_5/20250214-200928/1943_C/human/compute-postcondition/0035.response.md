Output State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[-1]`, `n` is the value of `previous[-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` assigns the value of `previous[-1]` to `n`. Since `path_ba` is a list containing the value `[-1]`, `path_ba[-1]` is `-1`. Therefore, `n` is set to `previous[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
