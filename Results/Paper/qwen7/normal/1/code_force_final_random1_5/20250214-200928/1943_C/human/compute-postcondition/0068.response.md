Output State: **`c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0, with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`, `ops` is a list containing three tuples `((c2, 1), (c2, 2), (c1, 4)), and `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c1, i))` appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 4, the new tuple added is `(c1, 4)`. Since `c1` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a new variable that takes the value of `c2` (as per the syntax of appending). Therefore, the updated list `ops` contains three tuples: `((c2, 1), (c2, 2), (c1, 4))`. All other variables remain unchanged.
