Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1**

The code `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. Since `u` was derived from the same input integer as `v`, `u` remains unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 is also preserved.
