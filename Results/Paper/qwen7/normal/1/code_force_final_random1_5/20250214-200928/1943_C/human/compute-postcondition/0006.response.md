Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list to which `v` has been appended.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list located at index `u` in the list `u2vs`. Since `u` and `v` are integers derived from user input (decreased by 1), the list `u2vs[u]` now contains the value of `v`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
