Output State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0, `_` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.

In this case, the code `a = func_1(d)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1(d)` to the variable `a`. However, since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. We only know that `a` now holds whatever `func_1(d)` returns. All other variables remain in their initial state.
