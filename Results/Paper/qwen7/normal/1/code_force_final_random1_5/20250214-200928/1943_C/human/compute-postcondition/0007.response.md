Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing `u` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`. Since `u2vs[v]` was previously a list to which `v` had been appended, now `u` is also added to this list. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
