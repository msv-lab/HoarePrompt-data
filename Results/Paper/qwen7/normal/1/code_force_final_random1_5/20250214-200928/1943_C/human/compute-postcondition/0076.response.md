Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci` if `len(path_ba)` is odd.
   - If `len(path_ba)` is even, then:
     - `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1.
     - `ops` is a list containing twelve specific tuples: `((c2, 1), (c2, 2), (c1, 4), (c2, 4), (c1, 6), (c2, 6), (c1, 8), (c2, 8), (c1, 10), (c2, 10), (c1, 12), (c2, 12))`.
   - `i` is 12.

2. **Determine the Value of `ops`:**
   - Since `i` is explicitly given as 12, it indicates that `len(path_ba)` must be even (because if it were odd, `ops` would contain tuples for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`).
   - Therefore, `ops` is set to the list of twelve specific tuples mentioned.

3. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement is `print(len(ops))`.
   - `ops` contains exactly 12 tuples.

Thus, the output of the print statement will be the length of the `ops` list, which is 12.

Output: **12**
