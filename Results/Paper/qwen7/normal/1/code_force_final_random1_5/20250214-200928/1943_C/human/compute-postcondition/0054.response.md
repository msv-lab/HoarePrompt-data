Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `ci + 1`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ops` is a list with an additional tuple `(c, i)` appended to it.
   - This information about `ops` is not directly relevant to the loop conditions.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < ci + 1`, we need to increment `i` by 1.
   - The value of `ci` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, we assume `ci` stays the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `ci` remains the same.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`ops` is a list with an additional tuple `(c, i)` appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ci` remains the same.**

Since the exact initial value of `i` and `ci` is not provided, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **`ops` is a list with an additional tuple `(c, i)` appended to it, `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `ci` is the same as before**
