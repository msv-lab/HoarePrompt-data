Output State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`, `n` is the value of `previous[b]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to `n`. Since `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`, `path_ba[-1]` refers to `b`. Therefore, `n` is set to the value of `previous[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
