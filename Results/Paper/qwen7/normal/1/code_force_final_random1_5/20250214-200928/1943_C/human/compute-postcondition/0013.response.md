Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u` is the first integer from the input decreased by 3, `v` is the second integer from the input decreased by 2, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing `u` and `u`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`. Initially, `u2vs[v]` contains only `u`. After executing `u2vs[v].append(u)`, the list `u2vs[v]` will contain both `u` and `u`, making it a list with two identical elements. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
