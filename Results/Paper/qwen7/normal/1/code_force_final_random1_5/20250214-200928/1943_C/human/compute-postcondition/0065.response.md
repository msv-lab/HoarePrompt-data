Output State: **`c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0, with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c1, 1)`, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c1, i))` appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Initially, `i` is 1, so after appending, `i` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
