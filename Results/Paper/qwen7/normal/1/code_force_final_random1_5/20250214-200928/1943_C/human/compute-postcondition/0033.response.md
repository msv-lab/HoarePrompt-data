Output State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[n]` (which is `-1`), and the current value of `n` is `-1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the list `path_ba` now contains the value `-1`, and all other variables retain their previous states.
