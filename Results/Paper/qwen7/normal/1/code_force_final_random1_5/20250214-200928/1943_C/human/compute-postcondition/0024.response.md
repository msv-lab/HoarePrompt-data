Output State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`**

Explanation: The code `d, previous = bfs(a)` performs a BFS traversal using the function `bfs` on the result `a` of `func_1(d)`. This updates the shortest path distances from node 0 to `d` and sets the parent pointers to `previous`. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is only used as an argument to the `bfs` function.
