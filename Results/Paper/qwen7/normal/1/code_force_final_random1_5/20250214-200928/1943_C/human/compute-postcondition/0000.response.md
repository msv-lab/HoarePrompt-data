Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, while the list `u2vs` remains unchanged. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\) and `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree is preserved.
