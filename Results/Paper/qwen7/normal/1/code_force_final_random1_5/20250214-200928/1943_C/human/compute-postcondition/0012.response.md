Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u` is the first integer from the input decreased by 3, `v` is the second integer from the input decreased by 2, `u2vs[u]` is a list containing `u` and `v`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `u2vs[u]`. Initially, `u2vs[u]` contains only the value of `u`. After executing the line `u2vs[u].append(v)`, the list `u2vs[u]` now contains both `u` and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
