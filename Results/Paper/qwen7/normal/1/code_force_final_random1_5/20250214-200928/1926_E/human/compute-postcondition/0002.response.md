Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input number, `k` is an integer equal to the second input number**.

This means that the code has taken two inputs from the user, split them, and converted them into integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The values of these variables depend on the user's input, but they are now integers. All other variables remain unaffected by this code.
