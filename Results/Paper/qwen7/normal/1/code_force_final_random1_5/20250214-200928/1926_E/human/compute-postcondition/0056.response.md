Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [4, 1, 2], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 8, `n` is 0, `m` is 2**

The code `L.append(m)` appends the value of `m` (which is 2) to the list `L`. Initially, `L` is `[4, 1]`. After appending 2 to the list, `L` becomes `[4, 1, 2]`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `tot`, `pow`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
