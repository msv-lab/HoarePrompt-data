Output State: **`a` is 0, `L` is [1, 0, 1], `pow` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `pow` is multiplied by 2, but since `pow` was not initialized before this line, it is assumed to be 1 (the default value for multiplication). After multiplying by 2, `pow` becomes 2. The values of `a` and `L` remain unchanged.
