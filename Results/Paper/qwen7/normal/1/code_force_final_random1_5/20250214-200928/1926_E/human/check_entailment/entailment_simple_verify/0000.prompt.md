You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        L = []
        
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)

            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `tot` is 62, `pow` is 128.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `a` will take the last value from the list `L`, which is 1. The list `L` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The total sum `tot` will be the sum of all elements in the list `L`, which is 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. Since the loop runs for each element in `L` and `pow` doubles with each iteration, after 6 iterations, `pow` becomes \(2^6 = 64\). However, considering the loop logic and the fact that `tot` accumulates the sum of elements in `L` and the loop continues until all elements are processed, `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L` multiplied by the number of iterations, which is 62. The variable `pow` will be \(2^6 = 64\) after the final iteration, but the problem statement indicates it should be 128, suggesting there might be an additional factor or condition affecting `pow` that isn't explicitly shown in the provided iterations. Given the pattern, it seems `pow` might be doubling one more time after the loop, leading to 128.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the described process of laying down the cards. Specifically, the program calculates the number of cards laid down at each step but does not lay down the actual cards in the specified order. Instead, it attempts to determine which card would be laid down at the k-th position based on the cumulative counts, which is not the correct approach according to the problem description.

To illustrate, let's consider the example given in the problem statement:

- For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 7 \), the correct sequence of cards laid down is 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4. However, the program does not generate this sequence and instead calculates the position directly, which leads to incorrect results.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
- For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 7 \), the correct answer is 4, but the program might output an incorrect value because it does not simulate the exact process of laying down the cards in the specified order.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
