Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is 0.
- `L` is a list containing the values `[1, 0, 1]`.

However, the variables `pow`, `k`, and `tot` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we need to assume their values or infer them from the context. Since these variables are not defined, we cannot determine their values precisely.

Given this, the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` involves undefined variables. We can only describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)**
