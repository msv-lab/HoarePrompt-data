Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `while n:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `n` is truthy (non-zero).

2. **Current state**: 
   - `a` is 1
   - `L` is [4]
   - `tot` is 1
   - `pow` is 8
   - `n` is -0 (which is equivalent to 0)
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `m` is 0

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero. Since `n` is currently -0 (which is 0), we need to change `n` to a non-zero value.

4. **Adjust the state**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is non-zero.

Therefore, the state after the adjustment should be:
State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [4], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 8, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 0**
