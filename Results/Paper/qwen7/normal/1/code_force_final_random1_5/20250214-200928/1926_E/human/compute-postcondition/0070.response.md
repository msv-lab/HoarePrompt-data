Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is 1.
   - `L` is a list `[1, 2, 1]`.
   - `tot` is 8.
   - `k` is between 8 and 12 (let's assume the exact value for calculation purposes; it doesn't matter which specific value within this range since the formula will be the same).
   - `pow` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - `pow` is given as 2.
   - `tot` is 8.
   - `k` is between 8 and 12. Let's assume `k = 10` for calculation purposes (the exact value doesn't change the result due to the nature of the formula).

   Now, substitute these values into the expression inside the `print` statement:
   \[
   \text{Expression} = pow \times (2 \times (k - tot) - 1)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Expression} = 2 \times (2 \times (10 - 8) - 1)
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses first:
   \[
   10 - 8 = 2
   \]
   So,
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4
   \]
   Then subtract 1:
   \[
   4 - 1 = 3
   \]
   Finally, multiply by `pow`:
   \[
   2 \times 3 = 6
   \]

4. **Output:**
   The `print` statement will output the result of the expression, which is 6.

Output: **6**
