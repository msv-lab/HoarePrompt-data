Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1, 2, 1], `tot` is 9, `k` is between 8 and 12, `pow` is 2**

Explanation: The code `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by the value of `a`. Given that `a` is 1 and `tot` is initially 8, `tot` becomes 9. The other variables (`L`, `k`, and `pow`) remain unchanged.
