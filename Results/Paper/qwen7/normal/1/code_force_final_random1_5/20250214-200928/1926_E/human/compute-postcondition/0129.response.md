Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `n` is the first input number
- `k` is the second input number
- `s` is 0
- `d` is the first input number
- `h` is the first input number
- `p` is 1
- `f` is `k - g`, where `g` is 0, so `f` is `k - 0` which simplifies to `k`
- `y` is 2
- `g` is 0

The expression `2 * k - 1` involves the variable `k`, which is the second input number. Since no specific value for `k` is given, we will keep it as `k`.

Output: **2 * k - 1**
