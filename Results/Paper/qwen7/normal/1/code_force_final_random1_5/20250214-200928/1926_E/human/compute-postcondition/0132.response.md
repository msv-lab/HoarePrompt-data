Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all test cases provided via input are processed. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions will hold true:

- `t` will be the total number of test cases initially provided.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` will retain their respective values from the last iteration of the loop.
- `s` will be the final value of `s` calculated for the last test case, which depends on whether `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, `s` will be the sum of the series described in the loop logic. Otherwise, it will be 0.
- `d` will be 0 for the last test case since the loop reduces `d` to 0 when the condition `s < k and d > 0` no longer holds.
- `h` will be 0 for the last test case as the loop reduces `h` to 0 under similar conditions.
- `p` will be `i` for the last test case, where `i` is the count of iterations performed for the last test case.
- `f` will be `k - g` for the last test case, where `g` is the cumulative value added during the loop.
- `y` will be the final result calculated based on the values of `i`, `f`, and `p` for the last test case. If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, `y` will be `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`. Otherwise, it will be 2.
- `g` will be the cumulative value added during the loop for the last test case, which is `k - f` if `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise 0.

All other variables (`i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `f`) will be specific to the last test case and will reflect the state after the loop has completed its iterations for that particular test case.
