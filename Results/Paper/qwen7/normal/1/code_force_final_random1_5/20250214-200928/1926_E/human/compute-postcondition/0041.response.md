Output State: `a` is 0, `L` is a list containing the values [1, 0, 1], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 4.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `a` will take the last value from the list `L`, which is 0. The variable `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L`, which is 1 (1 + 0 + 0). The variable `pow` will be multiplied by 2 for each iteration of the loop, so after 3 iterations, `pow` will be \(2^3 = 4\). The list `L` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
