Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is 12, `k` is between 8 and 12, `pow` is 32, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The line `L = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `L`. All other variables (`a`, `tot`, `k`, `pow`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
