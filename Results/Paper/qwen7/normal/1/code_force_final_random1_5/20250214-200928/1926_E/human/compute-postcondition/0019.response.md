Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input number, `L` is a list containing the values [1, 0, 1], `pow` is 1**

The code initializes the variable `pow` to 1. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `L`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
