Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is a list containing the values [1, 0, 1], `pow` is multiplied by 2**.

The variable `pow` is multiplied by 2, but its initial value is not specified. Therefore, we only know that `pow` has been modified to be twice its original value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
