Output State: **`a` is 4, `L` is [4, 1, 2, 1], `tot` is 8, `k` is between `tot` and `tot` + 4, `pow` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `pow` is multiplied by 2, changing its value from its initial state (which was implicitly 1, as it is not initialized elsewhere) to 2. All other variables (`a`, `L`, `tot`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
