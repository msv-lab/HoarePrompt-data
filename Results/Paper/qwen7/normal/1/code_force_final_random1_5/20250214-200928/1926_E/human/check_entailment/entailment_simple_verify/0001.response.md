### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Building the List `L`:**
   - The list `L` is built to store the number of cards laid down at each step.
   - In each iteration of the `while` loop, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of cards laid down in the current step.
   - `n` is then updated by subtracting `m`.
   - This continues until `n` becomes zero.

3. **Calculating the k-th Card:**
   - `tot` is initialized to 0, and `pow` is set to 1.
   - The program iterates over the list `L` and checks if `k` falls within the range `[tot, tot + a]` for each element `a` in `L`.
   - If `k` is within this range, it calculates the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.
   - `tot` is updated by adding `a` to it, and `pow` is doubled.

### Correctness Check

1. **Building the List `L`:**
   - The list `L` correctly stores the number of cards laid down at each step.
   - Each step corresponds to multiplying an odd number by a power of 2.

2. **Calculating the k-th Card:**
   - The logic for determining the k-th card is correct.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly identifies the card based on the current step and the position `k`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` might be small enough to complete all steps without needing to check further.
   - It correctly identifies the position of the k-th card in the sequence.

### Detailed Explanation

- **List Construction (`L`):**
  - The list `L` is constructed by repeatedly halving `n` (rounded up) until `n` becomes zero. This ensures that each step corresponds to laying down cards that are multiples of increasing powers of 2.
  - For example, if `n = 7`, the list `L` would be `[4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]` because:
    - First step: `m = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4` (cards 1, 3, 5, 7)
    - Second step: `m = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2` (cards 2, 6)
    - Third step: `m = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1` (card 4)
    - Remaining cards: 1, 1, 1, 1

- **K-th Card Calculation:**
  - The program iterates over the list `L` and uses the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` to find the k-th card.
  - `pow` doubles with each step, ensuring that the correct multiple of the odd number is identified.
  - `tot` keeps track of the cumulative count of cards laid down, allowing the program to determine the correct position within each step.

### Example Walkthrough

For `n = 7` and `k = 4`:
- `L = [4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
- `tot = 0`
- `pow = 1`

- First iteration:
  - `a = 4`, `tot = 0 + 4 = 4`, `pow = 1 * 2 = 2`
  - `k = 4` falls within `[0, 4]`, so the card is `2 * (4 - 0) - 1 = 7`

- Second iteration:
  - `a = 2`, `tot = 4 + 2 = 6`, `pow = 2 * 2 = 4`
  - `k = 4` does not fall within `[6, 8]`, so skip

- Third iteration:
  - `a = 1`, `tot = 6 + 1 = 7`, `pow = 4 * 2 = 8`
  - `k = 4` falls within `[7, 8]`, so the card is `8 * (4 - 7) - 1 = 4`

### Final Evaluation
