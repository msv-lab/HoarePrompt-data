Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is a list containing the values [1, 0, 1], `tot` is `tot` + 1.**

Explanation: The value of `a` remains unchanged at 1. The list `L` also remains unchanged with its contents being [1, 0, 1]. The variable `tot` is incremented by the value of `a`, which is 1, so `tot` becomes `tot` + 1.
