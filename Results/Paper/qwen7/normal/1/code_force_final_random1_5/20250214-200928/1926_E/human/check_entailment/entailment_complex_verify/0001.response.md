### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Building the List `L`:**
   - The list `L` is built to store the number of cards laid down at each step.
   - In each iteration of the `while` loop, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of cards laid down in the current step.
   - `n` is then updated by subtracting `m`.
   - This continues until `n` becomes zero.

3. **Calculating the k-th Card:**
   - `tot` is initialized to 0, and `pow` is set to 1.
   - The program iterates over the list `L` and checks if `k` falls within the range `[tot, tot + a]` for each element `a` in `L`.
   - If `k` is within this range, it calculates the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.
   - `tot` is updated by adding `a` to it, and `pow` is doubled.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Building the List `L`:**
   - The list `L` correctly stores the number of cards laid down at each step.
   - Each step corresponds to multiplying an odd number by a power of 2.

2. **Calculating the k-th Card:**
   - The logic for determining the k-th card is correct.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly identifies the card based on the current step and the position `k`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` might be small enough to complete all steps without needing to check further.
   - It correctly identifies the position of the k-th card in the sequence.

### Key Points to Validate

- **List Construction (`L`):**
  - The construction of `L` ensures that the number of cards laid down at each step is correctly calculated.
  - The list `L` is built by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2, which matches the problem's requirement of laying down cards in steps corresponding to multiples of odd numbers.

- **k-th Card Calculation:**
  - The calculation of the k-th card using `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` is correct.
  - The variable `pow` is correctly updated to reflect the step number, and `tot` keeps track of the cumulative count of cards laid down.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` might be small, ensuring that all cards are laid down in the correct order.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can conclude that it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program accurately determines the k-th card laid down by Vladislav.
