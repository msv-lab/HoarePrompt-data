Postcondition: `a` is 2, `L` is [2, 1], `tot` is 9, `k` is between 8 and 12, `pow` is 4. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the condition is always true since `tot` (9) is indeed less than `k` (which is between 8 and 12) and `k` is within the range of `tot + a` (9 + 2 = 11). Therefore, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
