### Reasoning:

1. **Identify the Required Functions**: The problem requires reading input and performing calculations for each test case. We need to identify which functions are relevant for this task.

2. **Relevant Functions**:
   - `func_10()`: Reads an integer from input.
   - `func_7()`: Reads a list of integers from input.
   - `func_15()`: Computes the number of valid pairs for a given \( n \) and \( m \).

3. **Analysis of `func_15()`**:
   - The function `func_15()` calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic in `func_15()` iterates through possible values of \(i\) and checks how many valid pairs exist for each \(i\). This is a correct approach to solving the problem.

4. **Input Reading**:
   - The input is read using `func_7()`, which reads a list of integers from the input.
   - There are no issues with the input reading functions as they correctly handle the input format.

5. **Output Writing**:
   - The output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is correct for writing results to the standard output.

6. **Main Function**:
   - `func_16()` correctly iterates over the test cases and calls `func_15()` for each pair of \(n\) and \(m\), printing the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It reads the input, processes it according to the problem statement, and outputs the correct results.

### Correctness:
**True**
