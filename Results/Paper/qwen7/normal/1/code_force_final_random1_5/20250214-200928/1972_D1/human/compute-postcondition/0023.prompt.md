Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `tmp` is 1000000000, `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of zeros and ones with the same length as the number of elements in the lists of `d`, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d`, `rank` is a list of integers with the same length as the number of keys in the dictionary `d`, and the length of `d[da]` is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
for di in d[da]:
    if processing[di - 1] == 0:
        processing[di - 1] = 1
        tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
        processing[di - 1] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tmp` is the minimum of its original value 1000000000 and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list with `di - 1` index set to 0, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d`, `rank` is a list of integers with the same length as the number of keys in the dictionary `d`, `d[da]` must have at least one element, and `di` is set to the first element of `d[da]`, and `processing[di - 1]` is equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tmp` is the minimum of its original value 1000000000 and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, and `processing[di - 1]` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `processing[di - 1]` is set to 0, `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, and `di` is updated to the next element in `d[da]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
