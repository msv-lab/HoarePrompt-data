Output State: **The program returns the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all valid \(i\) values, minus 1, where \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\sqrt{n + 1}\) and the loop continues as long as \(i^2 \leq n + i\).**

This means the program calculates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \(i\) starting from the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\sqrt{n + 1}\) until \(i^2 > n + i\), and then subtracts 1 from the final sum before returning the result.
