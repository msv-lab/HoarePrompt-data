Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `func_15()` returns a positive integer that is one less than its previous value.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `func_15()`. It only mentions that `func_15()` returns a positive integer that is one less than its previous value. Since no specific value is given for `func_15()`, the output state remains as described, with `t` unchanged and `func_15()` retaining its property of returning a positive integer one less than its previous value.
