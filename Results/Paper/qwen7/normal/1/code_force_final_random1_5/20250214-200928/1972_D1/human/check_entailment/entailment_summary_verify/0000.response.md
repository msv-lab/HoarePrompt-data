### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Let's break down the assessment and verify it step-by-step using the function summaries and the problem description.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Summaries**:
   - `func_16`: Processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6). It writes the value returned by `func_15()` (decreasing by 1 with each iteration) to the standard output, followed by a newline character, a total of `func_10()` times.
   - `func_15`: Attempts to solve a different problem and does not handle the conditions specified in the problem statement.

3. **Analysis**:
   - `func_16` is responsible for reading the test cases and calling `func_15` for each test case.
   - `func_15` is supposed to return the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\). However, the provided implementation in `func_15` does not address the required conditions. Instead, it attempts to solve a different problem involving a different mathematical operation (`(n + i) // (i * i)`).

Given these points, we can conclude that:
- `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
- `func_16` calls `func_15` but does not ensure that `func_15` is solving the correct problem.

Therefore, the program as provided is indeed incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to solve the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.
