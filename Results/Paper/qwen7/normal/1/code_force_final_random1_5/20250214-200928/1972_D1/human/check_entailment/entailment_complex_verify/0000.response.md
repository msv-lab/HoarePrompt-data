### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. Let's break down the provided program and the problem requirements to confirm this.

#### Problem Requirements:
- Calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \le a \le n\)
  - \(1 \le b \le m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Functions:
1. **Utility Functions:**
   - `func_1()`, `func_2()`, `func_3()`, `func_4()`, `func_5()`, `func_6()`, `func_7()`, `func_8()`, `func_9()`, `func_10()`, `func_11()`: These functions are primarily used for reading input from standard input. They do not implement any specific logic related to the problem.

2. **Relevant Functions:**
   - `func_12()`: This function seems to be related to some graph traversal or dynamic programming logic, but it is not used in the context of solving the given problem.
   - `func_13()`: This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.
   - `func_14()`: This function checks if a certain condition holds for a list of integers, but it is not used in the context of solving the given problem.
   - `func_15()`: This function calculates a sum involving division and floor operations, but it does not address the problem's requirements.
   - `func_16()`: This function processes test cases and writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output. However, `func_15()` does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem.

#### Analysis:
- **`func_15()`**: The function `func_15()` calculates a sum involving division and floor operations, but it does not involve checking the conditions \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be solving a different problem.
- **`func_16()`**: The function `func_16()` calls `func_15()` for each test case and writes the result to the standard output. Since `func_15()` does not implement the required logic, `func_16()` also does not solve the problem.

Given that none of the functions in the provided code implement the logic required to solve the given problem, the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not contain any implementation that correctly calculates the number of valid pairs according to the given conditions.
