The function `func_14` accepts four parameters: `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. 

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n and 0 <= m.
- `k` is an integer.

Based on the outputs provided:

- Case_1: The function returns 1.
- Case_2: The function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_14` is to accept a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`, and depending on the internal logic of the function, it either returns 1 or -1.
