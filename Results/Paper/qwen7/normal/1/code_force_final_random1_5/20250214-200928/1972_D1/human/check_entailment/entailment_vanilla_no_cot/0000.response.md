Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Functions Not Used**: Many of the functions defined (e.g., `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc.) are not used in the solution. This suggests that the code might be incomplete or incorrectly structured.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_15` and `func_16` do not implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic in `func_15` does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Missing Core Logic**: The core logic needed to solve the problem is missing. The problem requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This involves calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and checking the condition for each pair.

### Correct Solution Outline:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
1. Read the input values \(n\) and \(m\).
2. Iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
3. For each pair, calculate the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).
4. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
5. Count the number of valid pairs.

Here is a more appropriate approach to solving the problem:

```python
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = func_10()
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = func_2()
        result = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code defines a function `count_valid_pairs` that iterates through all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition. It then uses the provided input functions to read the test cases and print the results.
