Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the number of elements in the lists of `d`, an integer key `da` present in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the number of keys in the dictionary `d`. It returns 1 in Case_1, and `rank[da - 1]` which is `tmp + 1` in Case_2.**
