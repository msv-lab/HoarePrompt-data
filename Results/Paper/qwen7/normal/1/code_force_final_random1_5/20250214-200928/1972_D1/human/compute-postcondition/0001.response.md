Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `func_15()` returns a positive integer**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the return value of `func_15()` (which is a positive integer) to the standard output. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `t` or the return value of `func_15()`, the only information that remains unchanged is that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), and `func_15()` returns a positive integer. The specific value of `func_15()` is not known, so it is described as returning a positive integer.
