The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6). For each test case, it writes the value returned by `func_15()` (decreasing by 1 with each iteration) to the standard output, followed by a newline character, a total of `func_10()` times. After completing all iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged within its initial range, and `func_15()` has been called `func_10()` times, each time returning a decreasing integer value.
