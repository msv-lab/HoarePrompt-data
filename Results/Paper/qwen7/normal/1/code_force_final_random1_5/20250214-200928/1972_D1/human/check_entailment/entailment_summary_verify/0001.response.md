### Reasoning:

1. **Identify the Required Functions**:
   - The problem requires reading input and performing calculations for each test case. The relevant functions are:
     - `func_10()`: Reads an integer from input.
     - `func_7()`: Reads a list of integers from input.
     - `func_15()`: Computes the number of valid pairs for a given \( n \) and \( m \).

2. **Analysis of `func_15()`**:
   - The function `func_15()` calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the logic in `func_15()` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it incorrectly sums up the number of valid pairs by iterating over possible values of \(i\) and checking divisibility without considering the gcd condition.

3. **Input Reading**:
   - The input is read using `func_7()`, which reads a list of integers from the input. This is correct for reading the test cases and their parameters.

4. **Output Writing**:
   - The output is written using `sys.stdout.write`, which is correct for writing results to the standard output.

5. **Main Function**:
   - `func_16()` correctly iterates over the test cases and calls `func_15()` for each pair of \(n\) and \(m\), printing the result for each test case. However, since `func_15()` is incorrect, the output will be wrong.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. While the structure and input/output handling are correct, the core logic in `func_15()` is flawed.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
