Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `p[b] - p[a - 1]` to the variable `s`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
