Output State: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `m` is `m - 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. However, since the initial values of `a` and `b` were already defined as input integers, the only change is that these inputs are now explicitly stored in `a` and `b`. The values of `i`, `s`, `m`, and the nature of `a` and `b` (being input integers) remain unchanged from their initial state.
