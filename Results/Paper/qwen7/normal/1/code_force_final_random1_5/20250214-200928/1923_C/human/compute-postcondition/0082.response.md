Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is increased by 1, `l` must contain the value 1, `x` is 1, `p` contains the value [3, 2, 3], `c` is a list containing the values [2, 2, j]**.

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Since `j` was previously increased by 1, its current value is unknown, but it is appended to the list `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
