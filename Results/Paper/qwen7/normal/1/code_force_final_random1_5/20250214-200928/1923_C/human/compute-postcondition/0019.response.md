Output State: **`i` is 1 + `x`, `j` is 2, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers with the first element being 1 and the second element being 1, `p` is a list containing three elements [0, 1, 1 + `x`], `c` is a list containing the elements [0, 1]**.

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1 + `x`) to the list `p`. Initially, `p` contains two elements [0, 1]. After appending `i`, `p` now contains three elements [0, 1, 1 + `x`]. All other variables remain unchanged.
