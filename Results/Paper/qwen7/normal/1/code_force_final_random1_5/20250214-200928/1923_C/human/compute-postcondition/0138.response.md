Output State: **`x` is the next element in the list `l`; if `x` equals 1, then `i` is increased by `x + 1`, `j` is increased by 3, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i` and an additional element `i`, `c` is a list containing the new value of `j` and an additional element `j`, `c` is updated by appending the current value of `j` to itself; if `x` does not equal 1, then `i` is increased by `x`, `j` is increased by 2, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i` and an additional element `i`, `c` is a list containing the new value of `j` and an additional element `j`, `c` is updated by appending the current value of `j` to itself.**

This means that the value of `x` remains the same, and depending on whether `x` is 1 or not, the values of `i` and `j` are updated accordingly. The lists `p` and `c` are also updated by appending the new values of `i` and `j` respectively, and the current value of `j` is appended to `c`.
