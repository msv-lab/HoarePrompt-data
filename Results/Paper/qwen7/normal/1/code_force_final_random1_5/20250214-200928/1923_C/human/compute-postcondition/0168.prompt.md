Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5. c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, and for each query, l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [0]
    c = [0]
    i, j = 0, 0
    for x in l:
        if x == 1:
            j += 1
        i += x
        p.append(i)
        c.append(j)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
        s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `j` is the length of the list `l`, `m` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is a list containing the count of occurrences of 1 in `l`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is the total sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of 1's in `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, and `c` is a list containing the count of occurrences of 1 in `l` for each prefix sum.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed, `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers entered by the user for the final iteration, `i` will be `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` will be `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. The condition inside the if statement will be evaluated based on the last values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s`. If the condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is true, 'YES' will be printed; otherwise, 'NO' will be printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
