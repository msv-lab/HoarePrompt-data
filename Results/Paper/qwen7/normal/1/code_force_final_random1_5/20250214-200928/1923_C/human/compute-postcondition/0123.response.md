Output State: **`x` is 1; `i` is increased by 1; `j` is increased by 1; `p` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is increased by 1 in the initial state, the value of `i` before appending is the original value of `i` plus 1. The values of `x` and `j` remain unchanged.
