Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`
- The difference between `s` and `(b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`
- `b - a + 1` is greater than 1

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
