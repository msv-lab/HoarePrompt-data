Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers with the first element being 1 and the second element being 1, `p` is a list containing three elements [0, 1, 2], `c` is a list containing the elements [0, 1, 2]**.

This postcondition indicates that regardless of the value of `x`, the variables `i`, `j`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` retain their original values as specified in the precondition. Since the if condition checks if `x == 1`, and the if part does not change any of these variables, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
