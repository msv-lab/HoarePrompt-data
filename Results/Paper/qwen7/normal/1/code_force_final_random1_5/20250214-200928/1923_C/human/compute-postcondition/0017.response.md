Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers with the first element being 1 and the second element being 1, `p` is a list containing two elements [0, 1], `c` is a list containing the elements [0, 1]**.

This postcondition indicates that regardless of the value of `x`, the variables `i` and `j` will be set to 1 and 2 respectively, while other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`) retain their initial values as specified in the precondition.
