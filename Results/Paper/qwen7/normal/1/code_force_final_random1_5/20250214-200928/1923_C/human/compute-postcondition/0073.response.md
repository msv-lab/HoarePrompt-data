Output State: **`x` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, `l` must contain the value 1, `i` is 2, `p` contains the value 3, `c` is a list containing the value 2**.

Explanation: The code `i += x` increments the value of `i` by the value of `x`. Given that `x` is 1 and `i` was previously increased by 1 (making it 2), `i` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
