Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is equal to the count of 1's in `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, and `c` is a list containing the count of occurrences of 1 in `l` for each prefix sum.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will hold the total sum of all elements in the list `l`. The variable `j` will store the total count of the number 1 in the list `l`. The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, starting from 0. The list `c` will contain the count of how many times the number 1 appears up to each cumulative sum in `p`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition holds. Otherwise, the condition `(b - a + 1 <= 1 or s - (b - a + 1) < i)` holds.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `m` is decreased by 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then no change occurs. Otherwise, no change occurs as well.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `m` is `m - 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
