Output State: **`m` must be at least 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**

Explanation: The given code snippet does not change any variable's value. It simply reassigns the value of `s` to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, which is already defined in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
