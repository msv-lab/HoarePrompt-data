Output State: **`i` is 2 + x, `j` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers with the first element being 1 and the second element being 1, `p` is a list containing four elements [0, 1, 2, (2 + x)], `c` is a list containing the elements [0, 1, 2]**.

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given that `i` is `2 + x`, the list `p` is updated to include this new value. All other variables remain unchanged.
