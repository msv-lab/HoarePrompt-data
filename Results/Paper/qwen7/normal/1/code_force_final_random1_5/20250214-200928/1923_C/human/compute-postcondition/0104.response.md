Output State: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `m` is `m - 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `i = c[b] - c[a - 1]` updates the value of `i` to be the same as the previous value of `i`. Since the initial state of `i` was `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, the value of `i` remains unchanged. The other variables (`s`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected by this code.
