Output State: **`x` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, `l` must contain the value 1, `i` is 2, `p` contains the value [3, 2], `c` is a list containing the value 2**

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `p`. Initially, `p` contains the value 3. After appending 2 to `p`, `p` becomes [3, 2]. All other variables remain unchanged.
