Output State: **`m` must be at least 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `a` is updated to the first input integer, `b` is updated to the second input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The initial values of `a` and `b` are replaced by the input values, while the other variables (`m`, `i`, `s`, `c`, `p`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
