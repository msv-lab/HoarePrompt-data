Output State: **`i` is the total sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of 1's in `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is a list containing the count of occurrences of 1 in `l` for each prefix sum, `l` is updated with a new list of integers entered by the user, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers `n` and `m` as input and then reads a line of space-separated integers, converting them into a list of integers and assigning it to `l`. The values of `i`, `j`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged from their previous states.
