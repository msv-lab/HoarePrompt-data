Output State: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. Since the initial values of `a` and `b` were input integers, they are updated to the newly entered integer values. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
