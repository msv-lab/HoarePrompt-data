Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
