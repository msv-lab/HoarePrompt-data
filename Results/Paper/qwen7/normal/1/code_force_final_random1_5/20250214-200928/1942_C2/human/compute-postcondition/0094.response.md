Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `tmp` is a list containing zero or more elements, each of which is an integer calculated as `(a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2` where the condition `(a[j+1] - a[j]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2 - 1` is met for some `j` in the range `[1, len(a)-1]`. `ans` is the sum of 1 for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that differ by exactly 2, and the sum of `(a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2` for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy the condition `(a[j+1] - a[j]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2 - 1`, minus the total decrement of `y` which is the sum of `((a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2 - 1)` for each such pair. `n` is an integer, and the condition `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2` is satisfied; `ans` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
