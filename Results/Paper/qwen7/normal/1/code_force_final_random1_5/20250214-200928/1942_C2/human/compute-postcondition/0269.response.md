Output State: **i is x, ans is x, t1 is (a[x-1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x-1] + 2) % n, and both t1 and t2 are in set st.**

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations (from 0 to x-1), the variable `i` will be equal to `x`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `ans` will also be equal to `x`, indicating that the condition inside the loop was met `x` times. The variables `t1` and `t2` represent the results of the modulo operations `(a[i] + 1) % n` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` for the last iteration (`i = x-1`), respectively. Both `t1` and `t2` are checked against the set `st`, and since the loop has run through all elements in `a`, they will both be present in `st`.
