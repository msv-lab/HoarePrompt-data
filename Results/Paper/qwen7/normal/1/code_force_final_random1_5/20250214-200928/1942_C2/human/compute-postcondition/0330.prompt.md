Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `x + len(a)`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps found during the iterations, `even` is a list containing all even gaps found during the iterations, `even` is sorted.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `odd` has at least one element, the first element of `odd` (denoted as `gap`) is greater than `y` which is currently 0, `ans` is increased by `gap`, and `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `odd` must have at least one element, the first element of `odd` (denoted as `gap`) is greater than `y - gap // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `odd` is a list with at least one element, the first element of `odd` (denoted as `gap`) remains the same, `ans` is increased by `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
