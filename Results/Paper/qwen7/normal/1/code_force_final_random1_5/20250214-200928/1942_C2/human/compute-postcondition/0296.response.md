Postcondition: `i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `odd` is either `[gap]` or an empty list, `even` is `[gap]`, `gap` is equal to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, then `even` is updated to be `[gap]`.
