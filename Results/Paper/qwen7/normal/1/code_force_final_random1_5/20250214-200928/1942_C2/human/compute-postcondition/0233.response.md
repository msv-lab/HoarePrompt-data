Output State: **`even` is a sorted list in ascending order with the first element removed, `ans` is increased by `4 * y + first_gap`, `y` is decreased by `first_gap // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += 2 * y` adds `2 * y` to the current value of `ans`. Given that `ans` was initially increased by `2 * y + first_gap`, the new value of `ans` becomes `ans + 2 * y`, which simplifies to `2 * y + 2 * y + first_gap` or `4 * y + first_gap`. The value of `y` is decreased by `first_gap // 2`, and the state of `even` and the initial condition of `y` being less than `first_gap // 2` remain unchanged.
