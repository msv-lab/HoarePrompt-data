Output State: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, and `x` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `next_elem`. It checks if `i` is equal to `x - 1`. Since `i` is initially `x`, the condition `i == x - 1` is false, so `next_elem` is assigned the value `a[i + 1]`, which is `a[x]`. However, the given code snippet does not specify the value of `n`, so we cannot simplify `a[0] + n` further. All other variables remain unchanged.
