Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `ii` is `1`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer such that it is at least 1 and less than `len(a)`. If the value of `a[i]` is exactly 2 more than the value of `a[i - 1]`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, and if the difference is even and the current value of `y` is greater than half of the difference minus 2, then `tmp` is updated to include an additional element which is half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, and `ans` is incremented by half of the difference. Otherwise, no changes occur to `tmp` and `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is either 3, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, `ans` is increased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`, and `y` is decreased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`, or `i` is 2 and `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is either 3 or 4, `tmp` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is \((a[3] - a[2]) // 2\) or \((a[2] - a[1]) // 2\), and the second element is \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2\); `ans` is increased by \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1\), and `y` is decreased by \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2\).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
