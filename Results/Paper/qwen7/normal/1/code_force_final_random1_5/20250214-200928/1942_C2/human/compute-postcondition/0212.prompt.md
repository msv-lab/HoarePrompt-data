Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `even` list is sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `even` is a sorted list in ascending order, the first element in the list `gap` is odd, `ans` is increased by the value of `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `even` is a sorted list in ascending order, the first element in the list `gap` is the second odd number in the list, `ans` is increased by the value of `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `even` is a sorted list in ascending order, `gap` is the next odd number in the list `odd`, `odd` is the list `odd` minus the current `gap`, `ans` is increased by the value of `gap`, `y` is `-gap // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
