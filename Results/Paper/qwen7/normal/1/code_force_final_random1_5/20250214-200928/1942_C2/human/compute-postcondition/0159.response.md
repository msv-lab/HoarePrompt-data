Output State: **`i` is -1, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is -1, `y` is `c - 1`, `sx` is `y * 2`.**

Explanation: The code `y -= c` updates the value of `y` by subtracting `c` from it. Given that `c` is -1, `y` becomes `-1 - 1`, which is `-2`. The value of `sx` remains unchanged because the code does not directly modify `sx`. The other variables (`i` and `x`) are not affected by this operation.
