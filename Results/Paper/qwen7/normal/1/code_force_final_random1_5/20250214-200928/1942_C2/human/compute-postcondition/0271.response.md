Output State: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, both `t1` and `t2` are in set `st`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `even`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, and `odd` remain unchanged.
