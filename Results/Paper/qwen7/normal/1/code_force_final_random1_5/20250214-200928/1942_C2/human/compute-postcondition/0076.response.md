Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, `tmp` is a list containing two elements where the second element is `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, `ans` is incremented by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, which translates to `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
