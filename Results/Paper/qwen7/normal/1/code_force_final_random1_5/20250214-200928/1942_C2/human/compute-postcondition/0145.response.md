Postcondition: **Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` will be a list containing elements that are half of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` where those differences are even and greater than 2, and `ans` will be the sum of these half differences plus the count of times the difference between consecutive elements was exactly 2. Additionally, the condition `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2` holds true.**
