Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It then determines whether the given x integers form a valid set based on the constraints provided and returns appropriate outputs for each test case.**

- For each test case, it checks if the values of n, x, and y meet the specified constraints.
- It verifies that the x integers provided are distinct and within the range from 1 to n.
- Based on the validation, it returns specific outputs for each test case as required.
