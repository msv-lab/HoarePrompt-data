Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers where the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, and if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and the current value of `y` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` divided by 2 minus 2, then `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, the values of `tmp` and `ans` remain unchanged.
