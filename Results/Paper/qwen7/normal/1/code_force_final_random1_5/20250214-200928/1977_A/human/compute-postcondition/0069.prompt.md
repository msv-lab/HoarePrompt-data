Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if n == m:
        print('Yes')
    elif m > n:
        print('No')
    elif m == n - 1:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split. If `n` equals `m`, then `t` remains unchanged, `i` remains 0, and `n` and `m` remain as they were. Otherwise, if `m` is greater than `n`, then `m` remains greater than `n`. If `m` equals `n - 1`, then `m` remains as `n - 1`. Otherwise, both `m` and `n` are either both even or both odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split. If `n` is equal to `m`, no changes are made to `n` and `m`. If `m` is greater than `n`, no changes are made to `n` and `m`. If `m` equals `n - 1`, no changes are made to `n` and `m`. In all other cases, no changes are made to `n` and `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers from the first and second split respectively, and they are assigned the values from the input split. If `n` is equal to `m`, no changes are made to `n` and `m`. Otherwise, if both `n` and `m` are even, no changes are made to `n` and `m`. If at least one of `n` or `m` is odd, no changes are made to `n` and `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
