Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split**.

This means that the value of `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, while `i` is reset to 0. The variables `n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string into two integers.
