You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, i is t-1, n and m are the last input integers from the final split. If n equals m, no changes are made to n and m. If m is greater than n, no changes are made to n and m. If m equals n - 1, no changes are made to n and m. In all other cases, no changes are made to n and m.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it checks the relationship between \(n\) and \(m\) and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks various conditions to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - **Condition 1:** If `n == m`, it prints "Yes". This means that if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it's possible.
   - **Condition 2:** If `m > n`, it prints "No". This means that it's not possible to have more cubes than moves.
   - **Condition 3:** If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes". This means that if the number of cubes is one less than the number of moves, it's possible (by removing one cube at the end).
   - **Condition 4:** If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes". This condition is unnecessary because if `m` and `n` are both even, they can always match (e.g., adding and removing pairs of cubes).
   - **Condition 5:** If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes". This condition is also unnecessary because if `m` and `n` are both odd, they can always match (e.g., adding and removing pairs of cubes, plus one extra move).
   - **Default Condition:** If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No".

### Simplified Correct Conditions

- **Condition 1:** `n == m` → Yes
- **Condition 2:** `m > n` → No
- **Condition 3:** `m == n - 1` → Yes
- **Condition 4 & 5:** Unnecessary as covered by the first three conditions.

### Correctness Check

- **Condition 1:** `n == m` → Yes
- **Condition 2:** `m > n` → No
- **Condition 3:** `m == n - 1` → Yes

These conditions cover all necessary scenarios:
- If `n == m`, it's possible.
- If `m > n`, it's impossible.
- If `m == n - 1`, it's possible.

The additional conditions (4 and 5) are redundant and do not add any new valid scenarios.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the necessary conditions without redundancy. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
