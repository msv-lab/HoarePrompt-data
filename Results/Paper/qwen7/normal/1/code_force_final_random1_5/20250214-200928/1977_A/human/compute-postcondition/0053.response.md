Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer from the first split.
   - `m` is an input integer from the second split.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `t-1`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - At the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to these variables within the loop.

5. **Final State**:
   - After the first iteration, `i` becomes 2.
   - `t`, `n`, and `m` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split**.
