### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks various conditions to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - **Condition 1:** If `n == m`, it prints "Yes". This means that if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it's possible.
   - **Condition 2:** If `m > n`, it prints "No". This means that it's not possible to have more cubes than moves.
   - **Condition 3:** If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes". This means that if the number of cubes is one less than the number of moves, it's possible (by removing one cube at the end).
   - **Condition 4:** If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes". This condition is unnecessary because if `m` and `n` are both even, they can always match (e.g., adding and removing pairs of cubes).
   - **Condition 5:** If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes". This condition is also unnecessary because if `m` and `n` are both odd, they can always match (e.g., adding and removing pairs of cubes, plus one extra move).
   - **Default Condition:** If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No".

### Simplified Correct Conditions

- **Condition 1:** `n == m` → Yes
- **Condition 2:** `m > n` → No
- **Condition 3:** `m == n - 1` → Yes

These conditions cover all necessary scenarios:
- If `n == m`, it's possible.
- If `m > n`, it's impossible.
- If `m == n - 1`, it's possible.

The additional conditions (4 and 5) are redundant and do not add any new valid scenarios.

### Correctness Check

- **Condition 1:** `n == m` → Yes
- **Condition 2:** `m > n` → No
- **Condition 3:** `m == n - 1` → Yes

These conditions cover all necessary scenarios:
- If `n == m`, it's possible.
- If `m > n`, it's impossible.
- If `m == n - 1`, it's possible.

The additional conditions (4 and 5) are redundant and do not add any new valid scenarios.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the necessary conditions without redundancy. Therefore, the given program is correct.
