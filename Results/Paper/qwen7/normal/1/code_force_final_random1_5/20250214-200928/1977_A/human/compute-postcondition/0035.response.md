Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split. If `n` equals `m`, then `t` remains unchanged, `i` remains 0, and `n` and `m` remain as they were. Otherwise, if `m` is greater than `n`, then `m` remains greater than `n`. If `m` equals `n - 1`, then `m` remains as `n - 1`. Otherwise, both `m` and `n` are either both even or both odd.
