Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case.
- For each test case, the program checks the following conditions:
  - If \( n = m \), it prints 'Yes'.
  - If \( m > n \), it prints 'No'.
  - If \( m = n - 1 \), it prints 'Yes'.
  - If both \( n \) and \( m \) are even, it prints 'Yes'.
  - If both \( n \) and \( m \) are odd, it prints 'Yes'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, there are logical flaws in the conditions:
1. When \( m = n - 1 \), this condition is already covered by the possibility of adding or removing one cube at a time. This should be handled more generally.
2. The conditions for \( n \) and \( m \) being even or odd do not fully cover all scenarios where the operations can balance out to achieve \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

A more accurate approach would be:
- If \( m \) is within the range \([n - m, n + m]\) and both \( n \) and \( m \) have the same parity (both even or both odd), then it's possible to achieve \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

Given these points, the current implementation is not fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
