### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap
- The program needs to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Valid moves are either adding 1 cube or removing 1 cube.
- The program should output "Yes" if it's possible and "No" otherwise.

#### Program Code Analysis
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Annotated Code Analysis
The annotated code provides a clear state transition through each iteration of the loop. Let's break down the conditions:

1. **Condition 1:** `n == m`
   - If the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes. This is correct.

2. **Condition 2:** `m > n`
   - If the number of cubes required is greater than the number of moves, it's impossible. This is correct.

3. **Condition 3:** `m == n - 1`
   - If the number of cubes required is one less than the number of moves, it's possible. This is correct.

4. **Condition 4:** `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`
   - If both `m` and `n` are even, it's possible. This condition is unnecessary because if `m` and `n` are both even, they can always match (e.g., adding and removing pairs of cubes).

5. **Condition 5:** `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`
   - If both `m` and `n` are odd, it's possible. This condition is also unnecessary because if `m` and `n` are both odd, they can always match (e.g., adding and removing pairs of cubes, plus one extra move).

6. **Default Condition:** `else`
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No". This is correct.

#### Simplified Correct Conditions
- **Condition 1:** `n == m` → Yes
- **Condition 2:** `m > n` → No
- **Condition 3:** `m == n - 1` → Yes

These conditions cover all necessary scenarios:
- If `n == m`, it's possible.
- If `m > n`, it's impossible.
- If `m == n - 1`, it's possible.

The additional conditions (4 and 5) are redundant and do not add any new valid scenarios.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the necessary conditions without redundancy. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate.
