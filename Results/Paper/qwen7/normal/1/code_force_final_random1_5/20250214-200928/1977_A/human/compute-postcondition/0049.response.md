Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split. If `m` is greater than `n`, no changes are made to `n` and `m`. If `m` equals `n - 1`, no changes are made to `n` and `m`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `n` and `m`.
