Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):`. The key variables here are the expression inside `range`, which is `int(sys.stdin.readline())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as the value read from `sys.stdin` (converted to an integer) is a positive number.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: Since the loop depends on the value read from `sys.stdin`, the initial state must ensure that this value is a positive integer. Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the one that ensures the loop can start executing, which is the value read from `sys.stdin`.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- The value of `sys.stdin.readline()` must be a positive integer

Since `t` is already within the required range, the state can be simplified to focus on the value read from `sys.stdin`.

**Final State:**
State: **The value of `sys.stdin.readline()` must be a positive integer**
