Output State: **`t` is the new input integer, `a` is an input integer from the second input, `s` is updated to the new input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes a new input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their previous states.
