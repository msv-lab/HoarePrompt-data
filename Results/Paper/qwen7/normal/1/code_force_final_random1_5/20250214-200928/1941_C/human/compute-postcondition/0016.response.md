Output State: **`t` is the new input integer minus 1, `a` is an input integer from the second input, `s` is updated to the new input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `a` is an input integer from the current input, `s` is updated to the new input string, `y` is the count of 'pie' in the new string `s`.**

In this case, the code `y = s.count('pie')` updates the value of `y` to be the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
