Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` using the `count` method.
   - It then prints the sum of these counts.

### Problem Description Recap:
- A string is considered "ugly" if it contains either the substring "pie" or "map".
- To make the string "beautiful", we need to remove the minimum number of characters such that no "pie" or "map" substrings remain.
- The goal is to output the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

### Issues with the Given Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The program simply counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and prints their sum.
   - This approach does not account for overlapping substrings or the need to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate both "pie" and "map".

2. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the string "mmapnapie":
     - The program would count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie".
     - It would print `1 + 1 = 2`, which is correct since deleting the 4th and 9th characters makes the string beautiful.
   - However, for more complex cases, this approach fails:
     - For "mappppie":
       - The program would count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie".
       - It would print `1 + 1 = 2`, but actually, deleting only 2 characters (the 3rd and 7th) is sufficient to make the string beautiful.
     - For "ppiee":
       - The program would count 0 occurrences of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie".
       - It would print `0 + 1 = 1`, which is correct, but the optimal solution is to delete 2 characters (the 3rd and 5th).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not account for the optimal removal of characters to eliminate both "pie" and "map" substrings. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
