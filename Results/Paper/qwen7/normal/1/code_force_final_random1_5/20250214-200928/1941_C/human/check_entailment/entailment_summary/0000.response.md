Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s` and prints their sum. However, the goal is to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful, meaning it should not contain either 'map' or 'pie'. Counting the occurrences and summing them up does not achieve this goal.

For example, consider the string "mmapnapie". The program would count two occurrences of 'map' and one occurrence of 'pie', resulting in a total of 3. However, we only need to remove 2 characters ('m' and 'e') to make the string beautiful ("nap").

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
