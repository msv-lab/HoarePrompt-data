Output State: **`t` is the new input integer, `a` is an input integer from the second input, `s` is updated to the new input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, and `y` is calculated as the count of 'pie' in `s`.**

In this case, the code calculates the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
