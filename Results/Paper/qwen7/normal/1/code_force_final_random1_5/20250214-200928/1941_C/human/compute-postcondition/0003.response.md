Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `x = s.count('map')` counts the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `x`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
