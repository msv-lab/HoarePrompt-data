Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the new input integer (though its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `a` is an input integer from the second input (though its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `s` is updated to the new input string.
- `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
- `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

The print statement is `print(x + y)`, which means it will print the sum of the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s and y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s)**
