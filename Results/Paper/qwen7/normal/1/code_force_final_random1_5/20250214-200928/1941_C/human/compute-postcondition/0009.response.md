Output State: **`t` is the new input integer, `a` is an input integer from the second input, `s` is updated to the new input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s', `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s', and `x` is calculated as the count of 'map' in `s`.**

This means that the variable `x` now holds the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
