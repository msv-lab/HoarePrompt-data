Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, and `a` holds the integer value input by the user.
