Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `winner`, `a` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the second integer input converted to an integer**.

The code `a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The initial values of `t`, `results`, `a`, and `b` are updated according to the new inputs, while `winner` remains unchanged as it was already determined by `func_1(a, b)` before this line of code.
