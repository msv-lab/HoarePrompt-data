Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 998, `results` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are the value of `winner` and the third element is also `winner`, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**.

Explanation: The code `results.append(winner)` appends the value of `winner` to the list `results`. Since `results` initially contains two elements (both being `winner`), after appending `winner`, `results` will contain three elements, all of which are `winner`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `winner` remain unchanged from their initial states.
