Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `results` is an empty list, `a` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the second integer input converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The initial state of `t` and `results` remains unchanged.
