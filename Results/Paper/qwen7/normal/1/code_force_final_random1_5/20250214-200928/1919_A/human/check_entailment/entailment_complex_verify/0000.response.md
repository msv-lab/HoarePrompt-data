### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the given code step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns playing.
   - Each turn, a player can either swap wallets with their opponent or keep them.
   - A player removes one coin from their current wallet (the current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step).
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The game involves a sequence of moves where each player alternates.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a move due to having 0 coins in their wallet.
   - The problem statement mentions that if both players play optimally, the outcome depends on the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function takes two integers `a` and `b` and returns 'Bob' if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` and 'Alice' otherwise.
     - This function does not simulate any game moves; it only checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.

   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner.
     - The function then prints the results for each test case.

4. **Behavior of the Code:**
   - The code correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - The logic in `func_1` matches the problem statement's description of the optimal strategy: if the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
   - The code accurately simulates the optimal strategy without simulating the actual game moves, which is sufficient for determining the winner based on the given rules.

5. **Validation Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations confirm that the code correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
   - The code does not simulate the game moves but rather uses the optimal strategy derived from the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided solution correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, which aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement. Although the code does not simulate the actual game moves, it correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
