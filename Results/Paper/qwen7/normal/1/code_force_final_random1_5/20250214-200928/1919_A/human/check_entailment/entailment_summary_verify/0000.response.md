### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summaries to understand how the program behaves and whether it correctly simulates the described game.

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`:
- This function determines the winner based on the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- Specifically, if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob', otherwise it returns 'Alice'.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- This function processes multiple test cases.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b` and calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner.
- It stores the results in a list and prints them.

Now, let's consider the game rules:
- Players take turns, starting with Alice.
- In each turn, a player can either swap wallets or keep them.
- After swapping, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

Given the function `func_1(a, b)`:
- If the sum of the coins is even, 'Bob' wins.
- If the sum of the coins is odd, 'Alice' wins.

This implies that the function is making a decision based on the total number of coins rather than the actual sequence of moves and the ability to swap wallets. Let's consider the examples provided in the problem description:

1. **Example 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - Sum = 2 (even), so 'Bob' wins.
   - Analysis: Alice starts with 1 coin, swaps, Bob now has 1 coin, Alice can't make a move because she has no coins left.

2. **Example 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
   - Sum = 5 (odd), so 'Alice' wins.
   - Analysis: Alice starts with 1 coin, swaps, Bob now has 1 coin, Alice can't make a move because she has no coins left.

3. **Example 3**: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
   - Sum = 8 (even), so 'Bob' wins.
   - Analysis: Alice starts with 5 coins, swaps, Bob now has 5 coins, Alice can't make a move because she has no coins left.

4. **Example 4**: `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Sum = 9 (odd), so 'Alice' wins.
   - Analysis: Alice starts with 4 coins, swaps, Bob now has 4 coins, Alice can't make a move because she has no coins left.

From these examples, we can see that the function `func_1(a, b)` is indeed determining the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins, which aligns with the optimal strategy for the game. The key insight is that the player who starts with an odd sum of coins will always be able to force the other player into a losing position.

Therefore, the function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the total number of coins, which is equivalent to the optimal strategy for the game.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins, which is the optimal strategy for the described game.
