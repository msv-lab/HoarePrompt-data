Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000; `results` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code initializes `t` by taking an input from the user and converting it to an integer. It also creates an empty list named `results`. The value of `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `results` is now an empty list.
