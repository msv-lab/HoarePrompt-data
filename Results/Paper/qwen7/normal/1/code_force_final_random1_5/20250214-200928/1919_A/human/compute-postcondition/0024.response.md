Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calls another function `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner based on the values of \(a\) and \(b\). The results of these determinations are stored in a list. Finally, the function prints the results of each test case.**
