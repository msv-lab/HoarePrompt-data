Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `winner`, `a` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**.

Explanation: The line `results.append(winner)` appends the value of `winner` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending `winner`, `results` now contains one element, which is `winner`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `winner` remain unchanged from their initial states.
