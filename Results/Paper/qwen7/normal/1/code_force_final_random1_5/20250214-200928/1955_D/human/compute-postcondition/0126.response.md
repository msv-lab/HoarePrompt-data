Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing the unique elements of `b` from index 0 to `m-1`, `i` is `m - 1`, `curr` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `b` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `curr = 0` sets the variable `curr` to 0. All other variables (`b_values`, `i`, `ans`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
