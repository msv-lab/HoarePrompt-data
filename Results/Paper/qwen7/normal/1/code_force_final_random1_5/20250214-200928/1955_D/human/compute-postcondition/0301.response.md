Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1` or remains the same, `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` and the other conditions remain unchanged, `curr` is now equal to `curr - 1` if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` remains 0, and the conditions related to `n`, `m`, `len(b)`, `cnt_b`, `a`, `b_values`, `curr`, and `ans` are maintained as specified. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `curr` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`.
