Output State: **`i` is 2; `m` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of integers; `b_values` is a set of values; `curr` is increased by 1.**

The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. Since `i`, `m`, `a`, and `b_values` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, `curr` is increased by 1.
