Output State: **`i` is 3; `m` is a positive integer; `cnt_b[a[3]]` is decreased by 1**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 3, `a[i]` refers to `a[3]`. Since `m` is a positive integer and no operation affects `m`, its state remains unchanged. The value of `i` also remains unchanged. Therefore, `cnt_b[a[3]]` is decreased by 1.
