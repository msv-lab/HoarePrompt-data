Output State: **`i` is 2; `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`; `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1; `curr` is increased by 1; `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` remains 2, `n - m` must still be at least `m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is still decremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is now greater than or equal to `k`.
