Output State: **`i` is `n - m`, `cnt_b[a[n-m-1]]` is decreased by 1, `curr` reflects the net effect of all the increments and decrements performed over the iterations, and `ans` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts each integer into a list. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `cnt_b[a[n-m-1]]`, `curr`, or `ans`. Instead, it introduces a new variable `a` which is a list containing the integers entered by the user.
