Output State: **`curr` is incremented by 1, `i` is `n - m + len(b) + 2`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`; otherwise, `i` and `cnt_b` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. The values of `i`, `cnt_b[a[i]]`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged based on the conditions specified in the initial state.
