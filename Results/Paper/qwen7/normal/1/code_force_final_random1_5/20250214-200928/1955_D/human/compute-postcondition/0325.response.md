Output State: **`i` is the next element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[0]` is 0, `cnt_b[1] is 0, and cnt_b[i] is 0**.

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[i] = 0` sets the value of `cnt_b[i]` to 0. Since `i` is the next element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[0]` remains 0, and `cnt_b[1]` also remains 0. The value of `i` itself does not change, only its corresponding count in the list `cnt_b` changes to 0.
