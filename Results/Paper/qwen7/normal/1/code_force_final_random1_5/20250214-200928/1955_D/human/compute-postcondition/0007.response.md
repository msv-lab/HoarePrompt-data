Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of the element `b[i]` in the list `cnt_b`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
