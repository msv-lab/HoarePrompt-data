Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(m)`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially set to `n - m + len(b)`.

3. **Understand the Range of the Loop**: The loop runs from `0` to `m-1`. Therefore, `i` must be within this range for the loop to execute properly.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop runs from `0` to `m-1`, `i` must be in the range `0` to `m-1` for the loop to execute. Given that `i` is currently `n - m + len(b)`, we need to ensure that `n - m + len(b)` falls within the range `0` to `m-1`.

5. **Consider Other Relevant States**: While `i` is the only variable directly involved in the loop head, we should also consider other relevant states to ensure the loop logic works correctly. However, since the question specifically asks to adjust only the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i`.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is within the range `0` to `m-1`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is in the range 0 to m-1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `i` is initially set to `n - m + len(b)`**
