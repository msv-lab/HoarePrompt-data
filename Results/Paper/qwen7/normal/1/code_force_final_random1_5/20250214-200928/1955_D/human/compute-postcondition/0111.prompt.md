Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - m`, `cnt_b[a[n-m-1]]` will be decreased by 1, `curr` will be increased or decreased based on the conditions within the loop, and `ans` will be increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` for the last iteration where this condition holds true.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop:
- The variable `i` will take the final value of `n - m`.
- The counter `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` will be adjusted based on the operations performed during the loop, specifically involving increments and decrements.
- The variable `curr` will reflect the net effect of all the increments and decrements performed over the iterations, influenced by whether elements in `a` are found in `b_values`.
- The variable `ans` will be incremented by 1 each time `curr` reaches or exceeds `k`, ensuring that `ans` counts the number of such occurrences across all iterations.
Code of the loop:
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b_values` is a non-empty list or iterable with at least `n - m` elements, `a[n-m-1]` is a key in `cnt_b`, `cnt_b[a[n-m-1]]` is 0, `k` is a valid threshold value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b_values` is a non-empty list or iterable with at least `n - m - 1` elements, `a[n-m-1]` is a key in `cnt_b`, `cnt_b[a[n-m-1]]` is 0, `k` is a valid threshold value, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b_values` is a non-empty list or iterable with at least `n - m - 1` elements, `a[n-m-1]` is a key in `cnt_b`, `cnt_b[a[n-m-1]]` is 0, `k` is a valid threshold value, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `i` is the next element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
