Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros where each element `cnt_b[b[i]]` (for \(0 \leq i < m\)) has been incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, and no other changes have occurred to the other variables.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` stays as 1000000, and `cnt_b` is updated so that for each integer `x` in the list `b`, the count of `x` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1. The variable `i` will be equal to `m`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations, and `m` will be the total number of elements in the list `b`.
