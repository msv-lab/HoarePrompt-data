Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros**.

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt_b` as a list of zeros with a length of `max_val + 1`, which means it creates a list of 1000001 elements (from index 0 to 1000000) and sets each element to 0. The values of `t` and `max_val` remain unchanged.
