Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `b_values`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `b_values`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is set to the first element of `b_values`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - **Variable `i`**: Since the loop is iterating over `b_values`, `i` will be set to the next element in `b_values` for the next iteration.
   - **Variable `b_values`**: This list remains unchanged as it is the collection being iterated over.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - **`cnt_b[i]`**: This variable is updated within the loop body but its value at the start of the next iteration will depend on the loop body. However, since no specific update rule is given, we assume it retains its current value unless modified within the loop.
   - **`n` and `m`**: These variables are not directly involved in the loop head and their values remain unchanged.
   - **`curr`**: This variable is updated within the loop body but its value at the start of the next iteration will depend on the loop body. We assume it retains its current value unless modified within the loop.
   - **`ans`**: This variable is updated within the loop body but its value at the start of the next iteration will depend on the loop body. We assume it retains its current value unless modified within the loop.
   - **`b_values`**: As mentioned, this list remains unchanged.

Given these points, the only variables that need adjustment for the next iteration are `i` and `b_values`. Since `i` is the first element of `b_values` at the start of the current iteration, the next element in `b_values` will be the new value of `i`.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
- `i` will be the second element of `b_values`.
- `b_values` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cnt_b[i]` is 0, `i` is the second element of `b_values`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus the appropriate adjustments based on the presence of `a[i + m]` in `b_values`, `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `b_values` remains unchanged.**
