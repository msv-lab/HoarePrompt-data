Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 elements where each element is incremented based on the value of `b[i]` for \(i\) in the range of `m`, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is `m`, `m` is a positive integer, and `b_values` is a set containing unique values from the list `b`.**

Explanation: The line `b_values = set(b)` creates a set from the list `b`, which contains only the unique elements from `b`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `max_val`, `cnt_b`, `b`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables remain in their original states. The new variable `b_values` is a set of unique values from the list `b`.
