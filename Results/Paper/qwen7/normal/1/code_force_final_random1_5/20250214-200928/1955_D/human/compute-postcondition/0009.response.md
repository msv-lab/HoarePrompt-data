Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 2, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `b[i]` in the list `cnt_b`. Given that `i` is 2, the code specifically increments `cnt_b[b[2]]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
