Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 1, `ans` is 2 if `curr >= k`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. Since `i` is 3, `i + m` would be `3 + m`. The value of `n` and `m` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `curr` and `ans` also remain unchanged unless the condition `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was non-negative changes, which is not specified in the current state. Therefore, the only updated variable is `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, which is now one less than its previous value.
