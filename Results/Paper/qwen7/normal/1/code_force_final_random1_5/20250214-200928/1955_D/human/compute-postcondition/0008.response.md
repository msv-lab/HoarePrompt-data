Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(m)`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Current State After the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `max_val` is 1000000.
   - `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `m` must be at least 1.
   - `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `i < m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` must be at least 1.

4. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, `m` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 2.
   - `m` must remain at least 1 for the loop to execute, but since `i` is now 2, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1.**
