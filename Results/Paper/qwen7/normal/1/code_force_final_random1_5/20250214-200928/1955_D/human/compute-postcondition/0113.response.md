Output State: **`i` is `n - m`, `cnt_b[a[n-m-1]]` is decreased by 1, `curr` reflects the net effect of all the increments and decrements performed over the iterations, and `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. This changes the values of `n` and `m`, and introduces a new variable `k`. The values of `i`, `cnt_b[a[n-m-1]]`, `curr`, and `ans` are updated according to the initial state description, but their specific numerical values are not known without further input.
