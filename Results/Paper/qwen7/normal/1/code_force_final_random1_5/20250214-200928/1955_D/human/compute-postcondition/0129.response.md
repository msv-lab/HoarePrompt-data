Output State: **`x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of the list `a`, the value at index `i` in list `a` is present in the set `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.**

This means that the count of the value at index `i` in the list `a` (which is also present in the set `b_values`) in the dictionary `cnt_b` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
