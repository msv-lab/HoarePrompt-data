Postcondition: `i` is 2; `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; `curr` is decreased by 1; `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is increased by 1; `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is still greater than or equal to `k`.
