Output State: **`i` is 1, `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is decreased by 1, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` by 1. Since `i` is 1, `a[i + m]` becomes `a[1 + m]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
