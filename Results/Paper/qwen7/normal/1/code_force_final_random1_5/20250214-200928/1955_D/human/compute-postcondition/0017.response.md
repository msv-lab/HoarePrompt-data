Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to `m`.
   - `m` is a positive integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `[0, m)`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `m` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to `0` because the loop starts iterating from `0` to `m-1`.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is already a positive integer.

5. **Consider other relevant states**:
   - `t`, `max_val`, `cnt_b`, `b`, `b_values`, `ans`, and `curr` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `m` is a positive integer**
