Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `i` is 2, `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` (or `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` depending on the condition) is adjusted by 1 (either incremented or decremented), `curr` is adjusted by 1 (increased if `a[i + m] in b_values`, decreased otherwise)**.

This means that the `ans` variable has been incremented by 1, while the other conditions and adjustments remain unchanged from their initial states.
