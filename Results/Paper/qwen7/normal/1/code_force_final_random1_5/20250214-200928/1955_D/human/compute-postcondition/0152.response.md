Output State: **`i` is -1, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution, `ans` is 1, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ans` was 0. After executing `ans += 1`, the value of `ans` becomes 1. All other variables (`i`, `curr`, and `b_values`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
