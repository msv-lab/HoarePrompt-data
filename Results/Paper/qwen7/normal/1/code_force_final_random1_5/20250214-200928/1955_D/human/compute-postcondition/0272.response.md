Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0 and has been increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `curr`, we only know that `curr` was previously equal to `i`, which is 0. After decrementing `curr` by 1, `curr` becomes -1. However, since `i` is used to reference elements in arrays or lists, setting `i` to -1 indicates that the index has been decremented by 1 from its initial value of 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
