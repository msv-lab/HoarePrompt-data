Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `i` and `n - m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - m`.

3. **Initial state before the loop**:
   - `i` is -1 (this is given as the postcondition).
   - `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution.
   - `ans` is 1 (this is given as the postcondition).
   - `b_values` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine necessary adjustments**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being -1, the loop will not execute because `-1` is not less than `n - m` (assuming `n - m` is a non-negative integer).
   - Therefore, to make the loop execute, we need to adjust `i` such that it becomes 0 or more, ensuring that `i < n - m` is true.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to set `i` to 0 or any positive value that satisfies the loop condition.
   - The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b_values`, and `cnt_b` do not need to be adjusted since they are not mentioned in the loop head.

Given these points, the necessary adjustment is to set `i` to 0, ensuring the loop can start executing.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution, `ans` is 1, and `b_values` remains unchanged**.
