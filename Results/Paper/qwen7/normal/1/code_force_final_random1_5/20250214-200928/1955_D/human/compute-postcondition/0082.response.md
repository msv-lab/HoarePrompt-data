Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is either incremented by 1 or decremented by 1 depending on whether `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `curr` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increases the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
