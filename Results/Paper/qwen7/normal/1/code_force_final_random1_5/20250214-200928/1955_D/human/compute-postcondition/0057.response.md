Output State: **`i` is 0, `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is initialized.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `i` remains 0, `n - m` must still be at least `m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` was already decremented by 1 (and now `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is also decremented by 1), `curr` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is still initialized.
