Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and their values:

1. **i**: After the loop, `i` will be equal to `n - m`.
2. **cnt_b[a[n-m-1]]**: This counter will be decreased by 1 after the loop.
3. **curr**: This variable reflects the net effect of all the increments and decrements performed over the iterations, influenced by whether elements in `a` are found in `b_values`.
4. **ans**: This variable is incremented by 1 each time `curr` reaches or exceeds `k`, counting the number of such occurrences across all iterations.

The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of times curr reached or exceeded k during the loop iterations)**
