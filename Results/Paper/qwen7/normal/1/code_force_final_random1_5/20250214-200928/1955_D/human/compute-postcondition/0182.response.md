Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 2 (if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative and has been incremented by 1), `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the condition `curr >= k` is met, and `b_values` remains unchanged; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The condition `curr` and `ans` depend on the updated value of `cnt_b[a[i]]`.
