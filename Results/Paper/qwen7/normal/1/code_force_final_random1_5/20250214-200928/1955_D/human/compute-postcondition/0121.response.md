Output State: **`cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `m` must be greater than `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the count of `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 1`. The condition that `m` must be greater than `i + 1` remains unchanged.
