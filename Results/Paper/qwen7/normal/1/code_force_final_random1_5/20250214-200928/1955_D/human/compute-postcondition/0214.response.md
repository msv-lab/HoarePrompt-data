Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to `n - m - 1`, indicating the loop has processed each element in the range from 0 to `n - m - 1`.
- `n` must be greater than `m`.
- `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution, with adjustments based on the presence of `a[i + m]` in `b_values`.
- `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.
- `b_values` remains unchanged.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.

Output: **ans (where ans is the final count of times curr was greater than or equal to k during the loop execution)**
