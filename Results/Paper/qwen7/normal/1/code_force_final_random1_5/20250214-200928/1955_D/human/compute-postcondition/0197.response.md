Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - m - 1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` should be less than `n - m`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than `m`.
   - `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 2.
   - `ans` is 2 if `curr >= k`, and `b_values` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n - m`. Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `n - m` must be greater than 2. Given that `n` must be greater than `m`, this condition is already satisfied.

5. **Updating the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than `m`.
   - `curr` and `ans` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since no modifications are mentioned in the loop body, they stay the same.
   - `b_values` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 2, `ans` is 2 if `curr >= k`, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**
