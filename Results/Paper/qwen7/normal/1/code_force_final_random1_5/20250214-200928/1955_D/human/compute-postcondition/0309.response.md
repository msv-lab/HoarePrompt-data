Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1` or remains the same, `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` and the other conditions remain unchanged, `curr` is now equal to `curr + 1`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states. Therefore, `curr` is updated to its previous value plus 1, while the conditions involving `ans` (which checks if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` and increases `ans` accordingly) are preserved.
