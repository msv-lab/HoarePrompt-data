Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of the list `a`, and `b_values` is a set of integers. If the value at index `i` in list `a` is present in the set `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if it is non-negative. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is negative, no change is made to `cnt_b[a[i]]`.
