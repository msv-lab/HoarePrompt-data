Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n - m`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n - m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is -1.
   - `n` is known.
   - `m` is known.
   - `len(b)` is known.
   - `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1` or remains the same.
   - `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` and the other conditions remain unchanged.
   - `curr` is now equal to `curr + 1` if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`.
   - `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is -1, the next value of `i` would be 0 (as the loop starts from 0).
   - The condition `i < n - m` needs to be checked for the next iteration.

Given this information, we can conclude that `i` should be set to 0 for the next iteration, and the other variables (`n`, `m`, `len(b)`, `cnt_b[a[i]]`, `a[i + m]`, `b_values`, `curr`, and `ans`) remain unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise.

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- `n` is known
- `m` is known
- `len(b)` is known
- `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1` or remains the same
- `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` and the other conditions remain unchanged
- `curr` is now equal to `curr + 1` if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`
- `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1` or remains the same, `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` and the other conditions remain unchanged, `curr` is now equal to `curr + 1` if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k**.
