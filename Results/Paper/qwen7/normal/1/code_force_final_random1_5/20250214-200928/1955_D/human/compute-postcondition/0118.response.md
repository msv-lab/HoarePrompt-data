Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Statement
- The loop statement is:
  ```python
  for i in range(m):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `m-1`.
- The loop variable `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `m`.

### Current Iteration
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `0 <= k < m-1`), and `cnt_b[b[k]]` was incremented by 1.

### Next Iteration
- For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` should be less than `m`.

### Adjusting the State
- We need to update the state such that `i` is set to `k + 1`.
- Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, we don't need to adjust any other states.

### Updated State
- The updated state for the next iteration will be:
  - `i` is now `k + 1`.
  - `cnt_b[b[i]]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k + 1`** (where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration). 

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`**.

This means that `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
