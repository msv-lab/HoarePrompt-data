Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has a logical error in the sliding window approach used to count the number of good subsegments. Specifically, the way the counts are updated and the conditions for determining if a subsegment is good are incorrect. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The code updates `curr` based on whether `a[i]` and `a[i+m]` are in `b_values`, but it does not correctly handle the sliding window properly. It should decrement `curr` when removing the element from the window and increment `curr` when adding a new element to the window.

2. **Resetting Counts**: The counts in `cnt_b` are reset to zero after processing each test case, which is unnecessary and could cause issues if the same `cnt_b` array is reused without proper initialization.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    from collections import Counter

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Count occurrences of each element in b
        b_count = Counter(b)

        # Initialize the sliding window counts
        window_count = Counter()
        good_count = 0

        # First window
        for i in range(m):
            window_count[a[i]] += 1
            if window_count[a[i]] <= b_count[a[i]]:
                good_count += 1

        # Sliding window logic
        for i in range(n - m):
            # Remove the element going out of the window
            if window_count[a[i]] <= b_count[a[i]]:
                good_count -= 1
            window_count[a[i]] -= 1

            # Add the new element coming into the window
            window_count[a[i + m]] += 1
            if window_count[a[i + m]] <= b_count[a[i + m]]:
                good_count += 1

            # Check if the current window is good
            if good_count >= k:
                print(1, end=' ')
            else:
                print(0, end=' ')

        print()

```

This corrected version uses a sliding window approach with a `Counter` to keep track of the counts of elements in the current window. It correctly updates the counts and checks if the current window meets the condition of having at least `k` elements matching those in `b`.
