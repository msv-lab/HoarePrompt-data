Output State: **`i` is `n - m + len(b) + 2`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`; otherwise, `i` and `cnt_b` remain unchanged.**

This means that the value of `i` remains as `n - m + len(b) + 2`, and if `a[i]` was present in `b_values`, the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` has been decremented by 1. If `a[i]` was not in `b_values`, then `i` and `cnt_b` remain unchanged from their previous states.
