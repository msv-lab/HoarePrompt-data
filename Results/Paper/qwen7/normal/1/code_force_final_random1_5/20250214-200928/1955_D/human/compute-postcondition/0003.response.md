Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial values of `t`, `max_val`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `max_val` remains 1000000, and `cnt_b` remains a list of 1000001 zeros.
