Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t, two integers n and k, and a list a of n distinct integers. For each test case, it swaps the first and k-th elements of the list, then counts the number of elements less than or equal to the maximum element encountered so far (stored in h) and the number of occurrences of h in the list where the first element is not h. It prints the maximum of these two counts.**
