Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`, `i` is one less than the first element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `ans` is 0, `z` is 1, `s[0]` and `s[k - 1]` have swapped their values, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code, so their previous states remain unchanged.
