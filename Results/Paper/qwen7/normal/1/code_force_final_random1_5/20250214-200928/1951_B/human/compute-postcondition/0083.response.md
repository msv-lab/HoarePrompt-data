Output State: **`i` is now the last element of the new list `s`, `h` remains as the last element of the original list (first element of the swapped list), `z` remains unchanged, and `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to int, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to int.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `s`. The variable `i` is updated to be the last element of this new list `s`. The variables `h`, `z`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their previous states.
