Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s[1:]`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over the elements of the sequence `s` starting from the second element (i.e., `s[1:]`). The variable `i` takes on the value of each element in this sequence during each iteration.

3. **Postcondition analysis**: The postcondition states that `j` is increased by either 1 or 2. Additionally, if `h` is less than `i`, then `j` is increased by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 2.

4. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop head only involves `i`, we need to consider how `i` changes from one iteration to the next.
   - The value of `i` in the current iteration is the next element in the sequence `s` after the previous value of `i`.

Given these points, let's assume the following:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had some value, say `i_prev`.
- In the next iteration, `i` will take the next value in the sequence `s`, which we denote as `i_next`.

Since the loop starts from `s[1:]`, the first value of `i` in the first iteration would be `s[1]`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be set to the next value in the sequence `s`.

Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, we do not need to adjust any other states.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the next value in the sequence `s` after the previous value of `i`**.
