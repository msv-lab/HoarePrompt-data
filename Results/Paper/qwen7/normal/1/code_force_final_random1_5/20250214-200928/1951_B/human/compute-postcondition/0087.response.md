Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is now the last element of the new list `s`, `h` is now the first element of the original list (first element of the swapped list), `j` is -1, `z` remains unchanged, and `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to int.**

The code assigns `-1` to the variable `j`. All other variables retain their previous values.
