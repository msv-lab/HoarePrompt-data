Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ind` is a list.
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
   - `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
   - `x` is the `k`-th element of list `a`.
   - `c` equals 2 (we break out of the most internal loop or if statement).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value less than `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - Since `n` does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

5. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - The postcondition `c == 2` indicates that we break out of the loop or if statement if `c` equals 2. However, since we are focusing on the loop head, we don't need to adjust `c` here.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The other variables (`ind`, `a`, `k`, `x`, `c`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same as before**
