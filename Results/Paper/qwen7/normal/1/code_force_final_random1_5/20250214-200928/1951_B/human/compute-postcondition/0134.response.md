Postcondition: `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 2, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 1, `s` must be a non-empty list, and `i` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is less than or equal to `h`.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `p` remains equal to `j`, `i` remains the last element of the list `s`, `j` remains equal to the length of the list `s` minus 2, `ans1` is set to 1, `z` is set to 1, `s` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is less than or equal to `h`.
