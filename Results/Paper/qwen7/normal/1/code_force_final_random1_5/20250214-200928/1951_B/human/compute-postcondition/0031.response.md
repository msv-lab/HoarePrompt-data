Output State: **`ind` is a list containing indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, `c` is equal to 2, and `i` is equal to the index of the second element in `ind` + 1.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `ind` will contain the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`. The variable `c` will be equal to 2 because the loop breaks when `c` reaches 2. The variable `i` will be equal to the index of the second element in `ind` plus one, as the loop increments `i` with each iteration and stops when `c` is 2.
