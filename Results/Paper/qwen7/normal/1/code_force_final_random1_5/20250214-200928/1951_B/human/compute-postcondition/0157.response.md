Postcondition: `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `ans1` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `s[0]` equals `h` or `i > h`, `z` is 1, and `s` is a non-empty list. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is set to either 2 or 3 based on the condition `s[0]` equals `h` or `i > h`.
