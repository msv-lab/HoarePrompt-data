Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `i` is the second element of the list `s`, and `h` is less than `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Given the initial conditions, these remain unchanged except for the fact that the loop or conditional statement is exited.
