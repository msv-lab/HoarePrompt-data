Output State: **`i` is the second element of the list `s`, `j` is increased by 1, and `h` is less than `i`.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but rather breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `i`, `j`, and `h` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
