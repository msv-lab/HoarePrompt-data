Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 2, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `z = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `z`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `p`, `j`, `i`, `ans1`, and `s[p]` and `s[k - 1]` remain unchanged.
