Output State: **`a` is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of n cows, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `x` is the k-th element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the k-th element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions about the list `a` and the integer `k` are still valid.
