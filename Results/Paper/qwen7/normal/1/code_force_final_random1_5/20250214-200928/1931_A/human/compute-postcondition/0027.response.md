Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop condition. Here, the loop condition is `i < int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `word` is either 'zz', 'az', or 'aaa'.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `int(input())` remains the same.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `int(input())` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `n` and `word` do not change within the loop and are not part of the loop condition.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `int(input())` remains the same.
   - `n` and `word` remain unchanged.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `word` is either 'zz', 'az', or 'aaa', `i` is incremented by 1, and `int(input())` remains the same.**

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume the initial values were `n = 5`, `word = 'zz'`, `i = 2`, and `int(input()) = 5`. After the first iteration, `i` would be 3. For the next iteration:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `word` is either 'zz', 'az', or 'aaa', `i` is 4, and `int(input())` remains the same.**
