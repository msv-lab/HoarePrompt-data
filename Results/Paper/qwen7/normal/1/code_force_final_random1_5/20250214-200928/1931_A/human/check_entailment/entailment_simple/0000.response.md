Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the different ranges of `n` values to construct the lexicographically smallest word.
2. For `n > 52`, it constructs the word by adding the character corresponding to `n - 53` at the third position and appending 'zz'. This works because the maximum possible sum of three distinct letters (z=26, y=25, x=24) is 75, which is beyond the range handled here.
3. For `26 < n <= 52`, it constructs the word by adding 'a' at the second position, the character corresponding to `n - 27` at the third position, and 'z' at the first position. This ensures the smallest possible combination while keeping the sum correct.
4. For `n <= 26`, it constructs the word by adding 'aa' at the beginning and the character corresponding to `n - 2` at the end. This again ensures the smallest possible combination.

Given the constraints and the logic used, the program should generate the correct lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
