Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `word` is 'az', `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code appends `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` to the variable `word`. Given that `n` is an input integer, `alphabet[n - 28]` will be a character from the alphabet list at index `n - 28`. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact character, but we know it will be a single character. Assuming `n` is such that `n - 28` is within the bounds of the alphabet list, the resulting string will be `'az'`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 4.
