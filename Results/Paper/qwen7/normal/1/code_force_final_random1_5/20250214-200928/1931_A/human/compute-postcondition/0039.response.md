Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, but these integers are not passed as arguments to the function. Instead, the function's behavior is defined by the constraints on `t` and `n`. Depending on the values of `t` and `n`, the function returns different outputs, but since the parameters are not explicitly passed, the exact return values cannot be specified without additional context.**

Note: The provided code snippet does not include the logic to process `t` and `n`, so the exact return values cannot be determined from the given information alone.
