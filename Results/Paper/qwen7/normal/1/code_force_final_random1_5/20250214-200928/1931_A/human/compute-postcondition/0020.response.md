Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `word` is 'az', `i` is incremented by 1, and `int(input())` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code appends the characters 'a', the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 28`, and 'z' to the string `word`. Since `n` is an input integer, `n - 28` is used to index into the `alphabet` list, and assuming `alphabet` is a standard English alphabet list, the character at index `n - 28` would be the character corresponding to `n - 28`. However, without knowing the exact value of `n`, we cannot specify which exact character it is. But since the question does not provide the `alphabet` list and only specifies that `word` is an empty string initially, we can assume a generic case where `n` is such that `n - 28` is a valid index. For simplicity, we can consider the first two characters appended as 'a' and 'z', making `word` equal to 'az'. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
