Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and the input value used to determine the range of `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\).
   - `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range of `int(input())`. This means `i` will take values from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer.
   - Since `int(input())` is the upper bound of the range, it must be a valid integer within the context of the loop.

Given the constraints on `t`, `n`, and `alphabet`, the only variable that directly affects the loop's execution is the input value, which determines the range of `i`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is a valid positive integer. Given the constraints, the most appropriate adjustment would be to ensure that the input value is within a reasonable range (since `t` and `n` provide bounds, but the actual input could be different).

Since the input value is the key here, we need to ensure that the input value is a valid positive integer. 

**Final State Adjustment**:
- The input value must be a positive integer.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', and `int(input())` must be a positive integer.**
