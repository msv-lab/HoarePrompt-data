Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases and does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. Let's break down why:

1. **Case Handling**:
   - The code checks if `n` is greater than 52, which is incorrect. The maximum possible value for the encoded word (for 'zzz') is 78 (26 + 26 + 26).
   - It then tries to form the word based on the incorrect logic for different ranges of `n`.

2. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The code does not ensure that the word formed is the lexicographically smallest. For example, it incorrectly forms "aav" for `n=24`, but the correct answer should be "aaa".

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        # Calculate the first character
        if n >= 27:
            word += alphabet[(n - 1) // 26 - 1]
        else:
            word += 'a'
        
        # Calculate the second character
        if n % 26 >= 26:
            word += 'z'
        else:
            word += alphabet[n % 26 - 1]
        
        # Calculate the third character
        if n % 26 == 0:
            word += 'z'
        else:
            word += alphabet[n % 26 - 1]
        
        print(word)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **First Character Calculation**: 
  - If `n` is at least 27, the first character can be calculated as `(n - 1) // 26 - 1`.
  - If `n` is less than 27, the first character is 'a'.

- **Second and Third Characters Calculation**:
  - The second character is determined by `n % 26`. If `n % 26` is 26, the second character is 'z', otherwise, it is `alphabet[n % 26 - 1]`.
  - The third character follows the same logic as the second character.

This approach ensures that the word is formed in the lexicographically smallest order.
