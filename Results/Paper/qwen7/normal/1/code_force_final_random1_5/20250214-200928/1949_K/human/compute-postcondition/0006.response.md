Output State: **`numbers` is a list of `n-2` positive integers sorted in descending order, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers such that \(1 \leq na, nb, nc \leq n-3\) and \(na + nb + nc = n-2\), `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are updated with one fewer element each, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are updated by removing the previously added `num` from the respective group's sum.**

Explanation: The function `distribute_number(num)` is called, which likely removes the number `num` from its current group and updates the sums and group sizes accordingly. Since no specific implementation details of `distribute_number` are provided, we assume it correctly reduces the size of the groups and updates their sums by subtracting `num`. The conditions on `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged, and the list `numbers` and the overall structure of the groups and their sums are adjusted as described.
