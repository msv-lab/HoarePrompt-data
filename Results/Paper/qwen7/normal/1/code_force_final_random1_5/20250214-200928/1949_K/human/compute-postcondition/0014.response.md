Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n (an integer between 3 and 200,000), na, nb, and nc (integers between 1 and n-2 such that na + nb + nc = n), and a list of n positive integers called numbers. It returns either 'YES' along with three groups (group_a, group_b, group_c) if it's possible to divide the numbers into three groups with sizes na, nb, and nc respectively, or 'NO' if it's not possible.**
