Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array, `n`, and the value `m`.
3. It then reads the array `a` and the string `s` of commands.
4. The function `func_1` is designed to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
5. The function constructs a list `b` by iterating over the commands in `s` and appending elements from `a` to `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
6. After constructing `b`, it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` modulo `m` and appends these values to `ans`.
7. However, there is a critical issue with how `b` is constructed. The function should append the product of the remaining elements in `a` before removing an element, but instead, it appends elements directly from `a` without updating the product.
8. Additionally, the function returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly compute the product of the remaining elements in `a` before appending to `b`. This means the values in `b` do not accurately represent the state of the array `a` before each command is processed.

Correctness: **False**
