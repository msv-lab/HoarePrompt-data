Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, initializes the array `a` with `n` integers, and reads the string `s` containing the commands.

2. **Calling the Function `func_1`:**
   - The program calls the function `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty list `b` to store intermediate results.
   - It uses two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the left and right ends of the array `a`.
   - For each command in `s`, it appends the corresponding element from `a` to `b` and adjusts the pointers accordingly.
   - After processing all commands, it initializes `p` to 1 and iterates over the elements of `b` in reverse order.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the product of the remaining elements modulo `m` and appends the result to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed `ans`.

### Verification of Logic

1. **Command Processing:**
   - The function correctly processes the commands 'L' and 'R' by appending the appropriate elements to `b` and adjusting the pointers `l` and `r`.

2. **Product Calculation:**
   - The function correctly calculates the product of the remaining elements modulo `m` for each command.
   - However, there is a mistake in the logic. The function should calculate the product of the remaining elements before appending the result to `ans`. Currently, it appends the product after processing all commands, which is incorrect.

3. **Reversing the Order:**
   - The function reverses the order of `b` before processing the commands, but it should not reverse `b` at all. Instead, it should directly append the results in the correct order.

### Corrected Implementation

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in b:
        p = (p * v) % m
        ans.append(p)
    return ans
```

### Conclusion

The original implementation has a logical error in the product calculation and order of results. The corrected version ensures that the product is calculated correctly and the results are appended in the correct order.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
