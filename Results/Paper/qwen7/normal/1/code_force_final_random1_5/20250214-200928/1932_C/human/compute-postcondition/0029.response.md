Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `l` is either `1` or `2` or ... or `n-1`, `b` is a list containing elements from `a[l]` or `a[r]` based on the direction specified by `s`, and `r` is `0`; `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `l`, `b`, or `r`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
