You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `l` is either `1` or `2` or ... or `n-1`, `b` is a list containing elements from `a[l]` or `a[r]` based on the direction specified by `s`, and `r` is `0`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `p` is the product of all elements in the list `b` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing all the intermediate values of `p` computed in each iteration of the loop from the first to the last, with each value being the cumulative product of the elements in `b` up to that point modulo `m`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `p` will hold the final result of multiplying all elements in the list `b` together and taking the result modulo `m`. The list `ans` will contain a sequence of these cumulative products, starting from the first element of `b` and ending with the product of all elements in `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list containing the intermediate values of `p` computed in each iteration of the loop from the last to the first, with each value being the cumulative product of the elements in `b` up to that point modulo `m`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list containing the intermediate values of `p` computed in each iteration of the loop from the last to the first, where each value of `p` is the cumulative product of the elements in `b` up to that point modulo `m`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing the intermediate values of `p` computed in each iteration of the loop from the last to the first, with each value being the cumulative product of the elements in `b` up to that point modulo `m`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
