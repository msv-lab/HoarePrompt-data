Output State: **`i` is 2, `l` is either 1 or 2, `b` is `b` appended with `a[r]`, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3 or `n - 4`**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given that `r` was either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, after decrementing, `r` will now be `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
