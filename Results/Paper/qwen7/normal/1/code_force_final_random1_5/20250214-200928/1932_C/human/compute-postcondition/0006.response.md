Output State: **`l` is 0; `n` is a positive integer; `m` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing the element `a[0]`; `r` is `n - 1`; `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[l])` appends the element at index `l` of list `a` to list `b`. Given that `l` is initially 0, `a[l]` is `a[0]`. Therefore, `b` is updated to contain `a[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
