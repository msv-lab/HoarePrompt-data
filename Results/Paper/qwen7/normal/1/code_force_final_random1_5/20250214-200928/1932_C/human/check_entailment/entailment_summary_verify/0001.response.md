### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the function `func_1`:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation:**
   - The original function calculates the product of the remaining elements after processing all commands, which is incorrect. The product should be calculated for each command as it is processed.

2. **Order of Results:**
   - The original function appends the results in reverse order, which is also incorrect. The results should be appended in the correct order as the commands are processed.

The corrected version of the function `func_1` provided in the original assessment addresses these issues. Let's verify the corrected function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in b:
        p = (p * v) % m
        ans.append(p)
    return ans
```

This corrected function:
1. Appends the elements to `b` based on the commands 'L' and 'R'.
2. Initializes `p` to 1 and iterates over the elements of `b` in the correct order.
3. Calculates the product of the remaining elements modulo `m` for each command and appends the result to `ans`.

Given this analysis, the corrected function now correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues and providing the corrected solution.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
