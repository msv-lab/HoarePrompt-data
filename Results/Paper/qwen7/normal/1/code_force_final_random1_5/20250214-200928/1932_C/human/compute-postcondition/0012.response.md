Postcondition: `l` is 1 if `s[i]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0. `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing either the element `a[0]` (if `s[i]` is 'L') or the element `a[r]` (if `s[i]` is not 'L'), `r` is `n - 1` if `s[i]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`, and `i` is 0.
