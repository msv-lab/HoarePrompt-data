#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `l` is either `1` or `2` or ... or `n-1`, `b` is a list containing elements from `a[l]` or `a[r]` based on the direction specified by `s`, and `r` is `0`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `p` is the product of all elements in the list `b` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing all the intermediate values of `p` computed in each iteration of the loop from the first to the last, with each value being the cumulative product of the elements in `b` up to that point modulo `m`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `p` will hold the final result of multiplying all elements in the list `b` together and taking the result modulo `m`. The list `ans` will contain a sequence of these cumulative products, starting from the first element of `b` and ending with the product of all elements in `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list containing the intermediate values of `p` computed in each iteration of the loop from the last to the first, with each value being the cumulative product of the elements in `b` up to that point modulo `m`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the directions specified in `s`. Then, it computes a series of intermediate values of `p`, which is the cumulative product of elements in `b` modulo `m`, and stores these values in a list `ans`. Finally, it returns the list `ans` containing these intermediate values in reverse order.
