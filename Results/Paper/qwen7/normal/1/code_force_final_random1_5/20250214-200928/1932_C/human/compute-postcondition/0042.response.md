Output State: `p` is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `p` will hold the product of all elements in the list `b` taken modulo `m`. The list `ans` will contain each intermediate product value of `p` as the loop iterates through all elements in `b`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first.
