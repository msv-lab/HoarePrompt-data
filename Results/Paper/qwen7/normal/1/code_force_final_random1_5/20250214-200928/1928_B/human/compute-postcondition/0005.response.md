Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `len(arr) - 1`
- `tem` is `tem * arr[i]`
- `ans` contains the value of `tem` appended to it

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts from `len(arr) - 1` and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches `-1`.
2. **Variable `tem`**: This variable is updated inside the loop based on the current value of `arr[i]`.
3. **Variable `ans`**: This variable accumulates the values of `tem` as the loop progresses.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
- **Current Value of `i`**: Since the loop is decrementing `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i - 1`.
- **Current Value of `tem`**: `tem` is updated in the loop body, but since we don't know the exact update, we need to consider the general behavior. For the next iteration, `tem` will be updated based on the new value of `arr[i]`.
- **Current Value of `ans`**: `ans` will contain the accumulated values of `tem` up to the current iteration.

### Next Iteration
- **New Value of `i`**: `i` will be `len(arr) - 2` (since it was `len(arr) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
- **New Value of `tem`**: `tem` will be updated based on `arr[i]` (which is now `arr[len(arr) - 2]`).
- **New Value of `ans`**: `ans` will contain the previous value of `tem` appended to it.

### Final State
State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `tem` is `tem * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, `ans` contains the value of `tem` appended to it**.
