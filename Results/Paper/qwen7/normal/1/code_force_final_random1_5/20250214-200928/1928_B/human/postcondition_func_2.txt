The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by an integer `n` indicating the length of the array `a`, and then `n` integers representing the elements of the array `a`. After processing all test cases, the function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of elements in the array `a` for each test case.
