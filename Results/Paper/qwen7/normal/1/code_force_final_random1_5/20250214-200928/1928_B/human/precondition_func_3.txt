t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, representing the length of the array a; the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
