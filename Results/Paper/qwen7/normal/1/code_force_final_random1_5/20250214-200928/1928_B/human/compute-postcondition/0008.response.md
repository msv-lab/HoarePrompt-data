Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `len(arr) - 2`
   - `tem` is `tem * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`
   - `ans` is a list containing one element which is `tem`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts from `len(arr) - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` is -1.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(arr) - 2`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 from `len(arr) - 2` to `len(arr) - 3`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `len(arr) - 3`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be updated to `len(arr) - 3`.
   - The value of `tem` and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is `len(arr) - 3`
   - `tem` remains `tem * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`
   - `ans` remains a list containing one element which is `tem`

**Answer:**
State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 3`, `tem` is `tem * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `tem`**
