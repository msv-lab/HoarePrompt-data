The function processes input from the user, reading an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of the array `a`, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array `a`. After processing all test cases, it returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input, split by spaces.
