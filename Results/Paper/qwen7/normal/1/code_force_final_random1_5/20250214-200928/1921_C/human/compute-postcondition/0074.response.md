Output State: **`arr` and `array2` are such that if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains an additional element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, otherwise `array2` remains unchanged, where `i` is now `k + 1`; `array2` has an additional element `(arr[k + 1] - arr[k]) * a` appended to it.**

This means that the code appends an element to `array2` based on the condition given. If the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is true when `i` is `k + 1`, then `array2` will contain an additional element `(arr[k + 1] - arr[k]) * a`. If the condition is false, `array2` remains unchanged.
