Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `feat[0]`, `test_cases` is `tc`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `array2` is an empty list, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`**

The code initializes `array2` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `arr`, `i`, `test_cases`, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
