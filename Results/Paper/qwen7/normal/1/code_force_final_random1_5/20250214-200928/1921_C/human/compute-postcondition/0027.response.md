Based on the initial state provided:

- `test_cases` is a number greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `f` is the second element of the list `feat`.
- `a` is the third element of the list `feat`.
- `b` is the last element of the list `feat`.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- `array2` is a list containing elements where each element is \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a\) for every \(i\) in the range from 2 to `n`, and the condition \(arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a\) holds true for each of these elements.
- The sum of `array2` plus \((n - len(array2)) * b\) is greater than or equal to `f`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('No')
```

This print statement directly outputs the string `'No'` without any variables or conditions being evaluated further.

Output: **No**
