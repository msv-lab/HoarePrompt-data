Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 3, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `array2` is a list containing two elements where the first element is (arr[2] - arr[1]) * a, and the second element is (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a, and the condition arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a is still true.**

Explanation: The code appends `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` translates to `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`. This new value is added to `array2`, which initially had one element `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. The condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` remains unchanged and is still true.
