Postcondition: `arr` and `array2` are such that if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains an additional element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, otherwise `array2` remains unchanged, where `i` is now `k + 1`; in either case, `array2` has an additional element `(arr[k + 1] - arr[k]) * a` appended to it.
