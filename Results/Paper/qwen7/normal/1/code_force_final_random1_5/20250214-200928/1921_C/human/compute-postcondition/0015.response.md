Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)
   - `i` is 2
   - `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `f` is the second element of the list `feat`
   - `a` is the third element of the list `feat`
   - `b` is the last element of the list `feat`
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces
   - `array2` is a list containing one element which is \((arr[2] - arr[1]) * a\)
   - The condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is still true.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop condition does not depend on `n` changing within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)
- `i` is 3
- `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `f` is the second element of the list `feat`
- `a` is the third element of the list `feat`
- `b` is the last element of the list `feat`
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces
- `array2` is a list containing one element which is \((arr[2] - arr[1]) * a\)
- The condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is still true.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 3, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `array2` is a list containing one element which is (arr[2] - arr[1]) * a, and the condition arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a is still true.**
