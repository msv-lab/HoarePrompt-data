Postcondition: **`arr` and `array2` remain as they were after the loop executed. Specifically, `array2` contains all the elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is satisfied. The variable `arr` remains unchanged from its initial state, while `array2` is updated with new elements based on the specified condition for each iteration of the loop. Additionally, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.**
