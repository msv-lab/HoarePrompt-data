Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is `feat[0]`
   - `array2` remains unchanged

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` = 1 to `i` < `n`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 4.
   - `n` must remain `feat[0]` because it does not change within the loop.
   - `array2` remains unchanged as per the postcondition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `n` is `feat[0]`, and `array2` remains unchanged**
