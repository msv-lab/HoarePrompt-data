Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers where the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, and `array2` is a list containing the value of the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends to `array2` the value of the first element of `arr` (which is less than `b/a`) multiplied by `a`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `a` and `b`, we keep the condition that the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
