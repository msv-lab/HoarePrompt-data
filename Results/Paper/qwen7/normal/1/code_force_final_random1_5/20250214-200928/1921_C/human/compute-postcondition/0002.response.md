Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `feat` by splitting the input string using spaces and converting each element to an integer. The value of `test_cases` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
