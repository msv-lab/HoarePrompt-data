Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers. If the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` is a list containing the value of the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`. If the first element of `arr` is not less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` remains unchanged.
