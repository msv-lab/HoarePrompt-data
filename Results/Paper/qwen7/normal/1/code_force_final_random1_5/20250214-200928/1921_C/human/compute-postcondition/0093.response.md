Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is the first element of `feat`.
- `array2` contains elements based on unspecified conditions.
- The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. Since no other variables or objects need to be evaluated or described in this context, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Yes**
