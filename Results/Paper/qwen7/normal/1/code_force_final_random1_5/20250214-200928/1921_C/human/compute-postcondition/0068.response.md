Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to `feat[1]`.
   - `n` is initialized to `feat[1]`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute as long as `n > 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is set to `feat[1]`, its value is already correct for the loop to start.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other relevant states**:
   - `a` is set to `feat[2]`, but this does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `b` is set to `feat[-1]`, but this also does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `array2` is an empty list, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces. These do not affect the loop execution either.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
