Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`. The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), as indicated by `range(1, n)`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is based on the value of `i`. Specifically, the loop iterates over each integer from `1` to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that:
   - `arr` and `array2` are such that if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains an additional element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, otherwise `array2` remains unchanged.
   - In either case, `array2` has an additional element `(arr[k + 1] - arr[k]) * a` appended to it.
   - Here, `i` is now `k + 1`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `k + 2`.

5. **Update the Conditions**: Since `i` is now `k + 2`, the new condition for the postcondition will be:
   - If `arr[k + 2] - arr[k + 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains an additional element `(arr[k + 2] - arr[k + 1]) * a`, otherwise `array2` remains unchanged.
   - In either case, `array2` has an additional element `(arr[k + 2] - arr[k + 1]) * a` appended to it.

6. **Formulate the New State**: Based on the above points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values and conditions.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` and `array2` are such that if `arr[k + 2] - arr[k + 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains an additional element `(arr[k + 2] - arr[k + 1]) * a`, otherwise `array2` remains unchanged; in either case, `array2` has an additional element `(arr[k + 2] - arr[k + 1]) * a` appended to it.**
