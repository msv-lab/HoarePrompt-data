Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `array2` is a list containing the value 2 (since `arr[0] * a` evaluates to `2 * 1`).**

Explanation: The code snippet `array2.append(arr[0] * a)` appends the value of `arr[0] * a` to the list `array2`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2 and `n` is 1, we assume `arr[0]` is equivalent to `i` and `a` is equivalent to `n`. Therefore, `arr[0] * a` equals `2 * 1`, which is 2. This value is appended to `array2`, resulting in `array2` being a list containing the value 2. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
