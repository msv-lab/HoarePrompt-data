Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers where the difference between the first element and the element just before the first element (which does not exist, hence considered as 0) is less than `b/a`, and `array2` is a list containing one element which is `(arr[0] - 0) * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`. Since `i` is initially 0 and there is no element just before the first element (hence `arr[i - 1]` is considered as 0), the expression simplifies to `(arr[0] - 0) * a = arr[0] * a`. This value is appended to `array2`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition for `arr` remains the same.
