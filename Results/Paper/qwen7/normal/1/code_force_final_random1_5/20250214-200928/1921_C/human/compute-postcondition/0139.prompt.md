Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `feat[0]`, `test_cases` is `tc`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `array2` is an empty list, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if i == 0:
        if arr[0] < b / a:
            array2.append(arr[0] * a)
    elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers. `array2` is a list of integers where:
- If the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` contains the value of the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`.
- If the difference between the first element of `arr` and the element just before the first element (considered as 0) is less than `b/a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[0] - 0) * a`.
- Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is 1. If `arr[0] < b / a`, then `array2` contains the element `arr[0] * a`. If `arr[0] >= b / a` and `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains the element `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is 1, and `array2` is a list. If `i` is not 0, then `array2` contains either the value 2 or the value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`, depending on whether `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a` is true or false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
