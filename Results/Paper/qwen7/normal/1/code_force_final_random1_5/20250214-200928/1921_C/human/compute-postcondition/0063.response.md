Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `feat[1]`, `n` is `feat[1]`, and `array2` is empty.**

Explanation: The code assigns `feat[1]` to the variable `f`. Since `i` and `n` were both previously set to `feat[0]`, they remain unchanged. The value of `feat` and `array2` also remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` and `n` are now both equal to `feat[1]`.
