#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. Additionally, a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n is provided where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}.
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        
        f = feat[1]
        
        a = feat[2]
        
        b = feat[-1]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `arr` remains unchanged as an array of integers. `array2` contains all the elements \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a\) for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) where the condition \(arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a\) is satisfied. The final output will be 'Yes' if the sum of elements in `array2` plus \((n - len(array2)) * b\) is less than `f`, and 'No' otherwise. All other variables retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop, with `i` being equal to `test_cases - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \), two additional integers \( f \) and \( a \), and an array of \( n \) integers \( m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n \). For each test case, it calculates a new array \( array2 \) containing values \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) \times a\) for indices \( i \) where \( arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < \frac{b}{a} \). After constructing \( array2 \), it checks if the sum of its elements plus \((n - \text{len}(array2)) \times b\) is less than \( f \). If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
