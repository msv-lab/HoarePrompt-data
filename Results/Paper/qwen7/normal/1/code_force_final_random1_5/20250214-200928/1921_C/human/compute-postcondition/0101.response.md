Output State: **`i` is `feat[0]`, `test_cases` is `tc`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `array2` contains elements based on the specified conditions, `n` is now equal to `feat[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = feat[0]` assigns the value of `feat[0]` to the variable `n`. Since `i` and `n` both refer to `feat[0]` now, and no other changes were made to `test_cases` or `array2`, their values remain unchanged.
