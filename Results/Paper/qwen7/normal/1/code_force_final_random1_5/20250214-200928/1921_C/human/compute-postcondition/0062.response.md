Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `feat[0]`, `n` is `feat[0]`, and `array2` is empty.**

Explanation: The code `n = feat[0]` assigns the value of `feat[0]` to `n`. Since `i` and `n` both refer to the same element in the list `feat`, they now hold the same value. The list `feat` and the empty list `array2` remain unchanged.
