Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the field, players, goals, and the Quaffle based on the input.
2. The program processes each move step-by-step, updating the positions of players and the Quaffle.
3. The program handles the elimination of players when they collide with Bludgers and updates the score accordingly.
4. The program prints the correct events in the correct order, including scoring and eliminations.
5. The final score is correctly printed at the end of the game.

However, there is a logical error in the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to update the position of an entity based on the direction given. But the function currently returns a tuple that concatenates strings instead of updating the coordinates.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(position, direction):
    x, y = position
    dx, dy = mouvements[direction]
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the logical error in the `func_1` function.
