#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of strings representing the initial state of the Quidditch field, b is an integer representing the number of steps in the game.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple containing the concatenation of the first element of list `a` and the first element of list `b`, and the concatenation of the second element of list `a` and the second element of list `b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings `a` and an integer `b`. It returns a tuple where the first element is the concatenation of the first string from list `a` and the first character from `b`, and the second element is the concatenation of the second string from list `a` and the second character from `b`.
