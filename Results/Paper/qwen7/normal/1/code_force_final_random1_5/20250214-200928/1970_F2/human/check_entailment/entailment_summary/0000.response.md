Reasoning:
The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed before determining its correctness. Let's break down the problems:

1. **Incorrect Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is defined to take a list of strings and an integer, but it is used incorrectly in the program. It should be used to perform movements, but instead, it is being called with coordinates and a direction, which is not its intended purpose.

2. **Movement Logic**: The movement logic for players and bludgers is flawed. The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented for movement. Instead, it should update the positions of players and bludgers based on the direction specified.

3. **Bludger Interaction**: The interaction between players and bludgers is not correctly handled. The program should check if a player and a bludger are in the same position and eliminate the player accordingly.

4. **Quaffle Handling**: The handling of the Quaffle when a player throws it is incorrect. The Quaffle should be placed at the player's current position, not in an undefined state.

5. **Elimination Logic**: The elimination logic is not correctly sorted and printed. The players should be sorted alphabetically and printed in the correct order.

6. **Output Format**: The output format for events and the final score needs to be consistent with the problem statement.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is misused, and the overall logic for movement, elimination, and scoring is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
