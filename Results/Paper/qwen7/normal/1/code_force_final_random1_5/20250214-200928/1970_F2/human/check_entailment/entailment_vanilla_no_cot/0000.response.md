Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` is not used correctly**: The function `func_1` is defined to perform movements, but it is not called correctly in the main logic. For example, when moving players or the Quaffle, the function should be called with the current position and the direction, but the code directly uses `func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])` without storing the result back into `players[mo[0]]`.

2. **Handling of Bludgers and Player Eliminations**: The logic for handling bludgers and player eliminations is flawed. Specifically, the code checks for a bludger in `players`, but bludgers are stored separately in the dictionary `players`. The correct approach would be to check the bludger's position against the player's position.

3. **Incorrect Quaffle Handling**: When a player catches the Quaffle, the code sets `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` instead of `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`. This uses the `==` operator instead of the assignment operator `=`.

4. **Final Score Calculation**: The final score calculation assumes that the Quaffle is always moved to the middle when a goal is scored. However, the Quaffle might already be at the middle before scoring, so the code should handle this case correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
bludgers = set()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x].startswith('.'):
            bludgers.add(s[x])
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[0] == '.Q':
        quidditch[0] = func_1(quidditch[0], mouvements[mo[1]])
    elif mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if '.B' in players:
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                    if quidditch[1] == k:
                        quidditch = [players[k], '']
                    del players[k]
                    bludgers.remove('.B')
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                quidditch[0] = middle
            else:
                quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                quidditch[0] = middle
            else:
                quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above and should work as intended.
