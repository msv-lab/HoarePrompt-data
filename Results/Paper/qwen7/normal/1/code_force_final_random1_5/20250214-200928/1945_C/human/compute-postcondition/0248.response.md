Output State: **final is either [0] or an empty list, and remains sorted.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have been executed, the following conditions will hold:

- The variable `lst` will be empty because the condition `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` is never met throughout all iterations (since `lst` is reset to an empty list for each test case).
- The variable `mini` remains unchanged as it is only updated based on the current iteration's `pk` and `ele`.
- The variable `final` will either contain `[0]` if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50 for all test cases, or it will remain an empty list if `c1` is less than 50 for all test cases. Since `final` is sorted and no new elements are added once it is set, its state remains as described.

Thus, after all iterations, `final` will either be `[0]` if the condition `c1 >= 50` holds for all test cases, or it will be an empty list if the condition does not hold for any test case.
