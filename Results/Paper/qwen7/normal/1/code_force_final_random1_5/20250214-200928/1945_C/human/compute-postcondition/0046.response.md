Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1` (so `n > 4`), `zero` is either 1 or 2, `one` is either 2 or 3, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and `lst` is [3]**.

Explanation: The variable `one_perc` is updated to the value of `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. Here, `o` is assumed to be a typo and should be `one`, so the formula becomes `(one - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. Since `one` is either 2 or 3, and `one - one` is always 0, `one_perc` will be 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
