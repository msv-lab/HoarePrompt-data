Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is iterating over each element in `lst` using the variable `ele`. Therefore, the only variables involved in the loop head are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `lst`. Since `lst` must contain at least one element at the start, it means that after one iteration, `lst` still contains at least one element.

3. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still contain at least one element. The value of `mini` is updated based on the elements in `lst`, but since we are only concerned with the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to change `mini` or `pk` unless explicitly stated.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `lst` still contains at least one element.

**Answer:**
State: **`lst` must contain at least one element**
