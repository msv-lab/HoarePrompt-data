Output State: **The list `lst` remains unchanged from its final state after the third iteration. The variable `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in `lst`.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `lst` will retain its state from the end of the third iteration. The variable `mini` will hold the smallest value among its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`.
