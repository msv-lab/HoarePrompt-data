Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem`, which is an element from the list `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `lst`**: The list `lst` is initially `[3, 4, ..., n-1]`. This means that the list contains elements starting from 3 up to `n-1`.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in `lst`. For each element `elem`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)`. However, since `pk` is not mentioned in the initial state, we can assume it is a constant or a variable that remains unchanged within the loop.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will iterate over each element in `lst`, the list `lst` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. The initial state of `lst` is `[3, 4, ..., n-1]`, which ensures that there are elements to iterate over.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `mini`, `i`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `final` are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is the list `lst` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**State:**
**`lst` is a list containing at least one element from the sequence [3, 4, ..., n-1]**

This ensures that the loop can execute as it will have at least one element to iterate over.
