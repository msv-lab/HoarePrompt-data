Output State: **`pk` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is a list containing all elements of the original `lst` list sorted in ascending order, if the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now contains an additional element `0` at the end, otherwise `final` contains an additional element `n` appended to it, `t` is `t - 1`, `s` is the input string, `sl` is a list containing all characters of the input string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `sl = list(s)` creates a new list `sl` that contains all the characters of the input string `s`. The other variables (`pk`, `mini`, `final`, `c1`, `t`, `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
