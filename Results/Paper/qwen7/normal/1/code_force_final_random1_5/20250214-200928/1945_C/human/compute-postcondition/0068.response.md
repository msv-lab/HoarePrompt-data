Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for elem in lst:` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`. For each iteration, `elem` takes the value of the current element being processed.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `pk` remains unchanged.
   - `mini` remains unchanged.
   - `final` is now a list containing all elements of the original `final` list plus `elem`.

4. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next element from the list `lst` must be assigned to `elem`. This means `elem` will take the next value from the list `lst`.

5. **Adjust the State**: Since `pk` and `mini` remain unchanged, they do not need to be modified. However, `final` needs to be updated to include the next element from `lst`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `pk` remains unchanged.
- `mini` remains unchanged.
- `final` is now a list containing all elements of the original `final` list plus the next element from `lst`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`pk` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is now a list containing all elements of the original `final` list plus the next element from `lst`**.
