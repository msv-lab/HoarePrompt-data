Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is now the second element of `lst`, `mini` remains unchanged, and `final` contains the first two elements of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` (which is the second element of `lst`) to the list `final`. Since `final` originally contained the first element of `lst`, after appending `elem`, `final` will contain the first two elements of `lst`. The values of `lst` and `mini` remain unchanged.
