Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `i` is the only variable directly controlled by the loop itself. The other variables (`one_perc`, `zero_perc`, `mini`, `final`, `c1`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`) are not directly modified by the loop but may be affected by the loop body.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop runs for `i` in `range(n - 1)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, it stays the same.
   - **Other Variables**: Since the loop does not directly modify these variables, their values remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the above points, let's update the state for the next iteration:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- All other variables (`one_perc`, `zero_perc`, `mini`, `final`, `c1`, `t`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`) remain unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (i + 1) - 1)`, `zero_perc` is `z * 100 // ((i + 1) + 1)`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is sorted, `c1` is less than 50, `t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` and `one` are either both 0 or both 1, and if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is `[i + 2]`**.
