Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (since `range(n - 1)` starts from 0).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 so that the loop can execute.
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mini` is 100000000, `final` is sorted, `c1` is less than 50, `t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list.**
