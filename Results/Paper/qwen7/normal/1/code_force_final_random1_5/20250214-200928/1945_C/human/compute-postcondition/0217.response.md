Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `mini` to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the current element `ele` from the list `lst`. Since the loop continues as long as `lst` contains at least one element, `lst` must still contain at least one element. The value of `mini` is updated based on the current value of `mini` and the new element `ele` in each iteration.
