Output State: **`lst` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element of `lst`, `mini` is the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem`, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst` and `elem`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` (which is the second element of `lst`) to the list `final`. Initially, `final` contains only the first element of `lst`. After appending `elem`, `final` will contain both the first element and `elem`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
