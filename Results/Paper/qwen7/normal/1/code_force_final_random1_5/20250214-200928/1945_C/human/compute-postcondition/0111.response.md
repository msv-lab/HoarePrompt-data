Postcondition: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is either 0 or 50 depending on the value of `zero`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and if `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50`, then `lst` is a list containing the value of `i + 1`.**
