Output State: **`final` is a sorted list with length 1, containing the value of `n`; `c1` is less than 50.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially a sorted list with length 0, after appending `n`, `final` becomes a sorted list with length 1, containing the value of `n`. The value of `c1` remains unchanged and is still less than 50.
