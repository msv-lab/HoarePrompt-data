Output State: **`one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `zero_perc` is `z * 100 // (i + 1)`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is sorted, `c1` is less than 50, `t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` and `one` are either both 0 or both 1, `lst` is an empty list, and `s[i]` is either '0' or not '0'.**

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
