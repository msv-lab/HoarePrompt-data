Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in lst:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, `mini` remains unchanged, and `final` contains the first element of `lst`.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still contain at least one element. Since `elem` is set to the first element in `lst`, removing this element from `lst` would mean `lst` no longer contains at least one element, thus breaking the loop.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute again, `lst` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, `lst` should still contain at least one element, `elem` should now be the second element in `lst`, and `final` should still contain the first element of the original `lst` (since it was not modified in the loop).

5. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above reasoning, the new state should reflect that `lst` still contains at least one element, `elem` is now the second element in `lst`, and `mini` and `final` remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the second element in `lst`, `mini` remains unchanged, and `final` contains the first element of `lst`**.
