Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All the variables remain unchanged except for `zero`, `one`, and `lst`. After all iterations of the loop, `zero` will be the total count of '0' in the string `s`, `one` will be the total count of '1' in the string `s`, and `lst` will contain all positions `i + 1` where both `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` are greater than or equal to 50.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
