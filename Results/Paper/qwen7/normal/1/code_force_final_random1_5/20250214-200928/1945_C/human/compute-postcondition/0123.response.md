Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is either 0, 100, or 50, `one` is 2, and `one_perc` is -200 * (o - 2) // (n - 1)**

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1, changing its value from its initial state (either 0, 1, or 2) to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
