Output State: **`t` must be at least 1 and at most 2â‹…10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `pk` is `n / 2`.**

The code assigns the value of `n / 2` to the variable `pk`. Since `n` is an input integer and is specified to be odd, `pk` will be a floating-point number representing half of `n`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
