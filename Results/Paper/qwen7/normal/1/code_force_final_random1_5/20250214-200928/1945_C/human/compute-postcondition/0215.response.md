Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `ele` which iterates over the list `lst`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `lst`.

3. **Determine the State After One Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `lst` must contain at least one element.
   - The variable `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `ele` is iterating over `lst`, after one iteration, `lst` will have one less element.
   - `mini` will be updated to the minimum value it had before plus the new comparison with the current `ele`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `lst` must now contain at least one less element than before.
   - `mini` will be updated to the minimum value it had before plus the new comparison with the current `ele`.

Given the above reasoning, the new state for the next iteration should be:

**State: `lst` must contain at least one less element than before, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**.

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume the initial state was `lst` containing `[5, 3, 8]` and `mini` was initially some value (let's say `mini = 10`). After one iteration where `ele` was `5`, `mini` would be updated to the minimum of `10` and `abs(pk - 5)`. For the next iteration, `lst` would now be `[3, 8]` and `mini` would be updated to the minimum of its previous value and `abs(pk - 3)` or `abs(pk - 8)`.

So, the final state for the next iteration would be:

**State: `lst` must contain at least two elements, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**.

This is the general form of the answer based on the given conditions.
