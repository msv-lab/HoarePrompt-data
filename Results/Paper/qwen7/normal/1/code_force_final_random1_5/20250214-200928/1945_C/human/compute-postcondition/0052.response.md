Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, zero is either 1, 2, or 3, one is either 2, 3, or 4, zero_perc is 100, one_perc is -100, and `lst` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The line `mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))` updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The values of `i`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `lst` remain unchanged from their initial states.
