Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 1, and `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1`.

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 3 (since `i < n - 1` implies `2 < n - 1` or `n > 3`).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.
   - The other variables (`zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, and `s`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition alone.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1` (which means `n > 3`)**.
