Postcondition: **`zero_perc` is updated to either `zero * 100 // (i + 3)` if `s[i] == '0'` or `zero * 100 // (i + 2)` if `s[i] != '0'`, `one_perc` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` remains unchanged, `c1` remains unchanged, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, `sl` remains unchanged, `o` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] == '0'`, and `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] != '0'`, and `lst` remains as it was before the if statement.**
