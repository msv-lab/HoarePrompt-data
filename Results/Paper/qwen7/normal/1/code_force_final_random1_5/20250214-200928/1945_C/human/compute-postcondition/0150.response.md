Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `lst` must have at least 2 elements.
- `elem` is the second element of `lst`.
- `mini` is the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem`.
- `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst` and `elem`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for elem in lst:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` was set to the second element of `lst`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` should be set to the next element in `lst`.

### Adjusting States:
- Since `elem` is the variable being iterated over, it needs to be updated to the next element in `lst`.
- `mini` and `final` are dependent on `pk` and `elem`, so they need to be recalculated based on the new value of `elem`.

### New State:
- `lst` must still have at least 2 elements.
- `elem` should now be the third element of `lst` (since the second element was processed in the previous iteration).
- `mini` should be the absolute difference between `pk` and the new `elem`.
- `final` should be a list containing the first element of `lst` and the new `elem`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`lst` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the third element of `lst`, `mini` is the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem`, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst` and `elem`.**
