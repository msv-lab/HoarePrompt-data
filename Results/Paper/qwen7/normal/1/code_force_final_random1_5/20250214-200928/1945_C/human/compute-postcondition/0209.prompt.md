Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` is 100000000, `final` is sorted, if `final` has a length of 0, it remains unchanged, if `final` has a length of 1, it contains either 0 or the value of `n`, `c1` is less than 50, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `zero_perc` is `z * 100 // (i + 1)`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is sorted, `c1` is less than 50, `t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` and `one` are either both 0 or both 1, and if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is `[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `zero_perc` is updated to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` remains unchanged, `c1` remains unchanged, `t` is `t-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, `sl` remains unchanged, `o` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `zero` remains unchanged, `one` remains unchanged, and `lst` is now `[i + 1]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, these variables remain as they were before the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `zero_perc` is updated to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` remains unchanged, `c1` remains unchanged, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, `sl` remains unchanged, `o` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] == '0'`, `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] != '0'`, `lst` now contains `i + 1` appended to its end, if `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
