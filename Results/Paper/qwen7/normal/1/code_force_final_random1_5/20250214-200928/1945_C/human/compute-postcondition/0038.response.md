Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1`, `zero` is 1, `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is -100, and `lst` is [3]. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` remains [3]. Otherwise, no change occurs in the variables.
