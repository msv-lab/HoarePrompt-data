Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, `mini` remains unchanged, and `final` now contains the first element of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code appends the first element (`elem`) of the list `lst` to the list `final`. The other conditions and values of the variables remain the same.
