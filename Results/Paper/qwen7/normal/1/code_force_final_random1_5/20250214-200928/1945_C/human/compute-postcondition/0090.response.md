Output State: **`pk` is `n / 2`, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is a list containing all elements of the original `lst` list sorted in ascending order, if the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now contains an additional element `0` at the end, otherwise `final` contains an additional element `n` appended to it, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string.**

Explanation: The code `pk = n / 2` assigns the value of `n / 2` to the variable `pk`. The other variables (`mini`, `final`, `c1`, `t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `t` is decremented by 1.
