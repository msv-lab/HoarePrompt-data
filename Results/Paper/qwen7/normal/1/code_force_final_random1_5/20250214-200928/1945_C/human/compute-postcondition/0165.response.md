Based on the initial state provided:

- The list `final` is sorted.
- If `final` has a length of 0, it remains unchanged.
- If `final` has a length of 1, it contains either 0 or the value of `n`.
- `c1` is less than 50.

The `print(final[0])` statement will print the first element of the list `final`.

Given the conditions:
- If `final` is empty (length 0), it remains unchanged, so `final[0]` does not exist.
- If `final` has one element, it can be either 0 or `n`.

Since `c1` being less than 50 does not directly affect the content of `final`, we focus on the length of `final`:
- If `final` has a length of 1, the first element can be either 0 or `n`.

Therefore, the output will depend on the specific value of `n` if `final` has a length of 1. However, without knowing the exact value of `n`, we can describe the possible outputs.

Output: **0 or n (depending on the value of n when final has a length of 1)**
