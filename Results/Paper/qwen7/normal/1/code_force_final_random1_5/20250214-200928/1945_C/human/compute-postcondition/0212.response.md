Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `lst` must contain at least one element.
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in `lst`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for ele in lst:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `ele` and `lst`.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `lst`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `lst`, the variable `ele` will take on the value of each element in `lst` during each iteration.
   - The variable `lst` itself does not change within the loop; it is the elements being iterated over that change.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still contain at least one element.
   - The value of `mini` will be updated based on the new element `ele` that is about to be processed.

7. **Updated State**:
   - `lst` must still contain at least one element (since the loop will continue if there is at least one element).
   - `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the new element `ele`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the new element `ele`.**
