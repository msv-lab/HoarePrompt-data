Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position. It correctly handles the sorting logic by returning the difference in balance or position depending on the equality of the balance values. This function is used within `func_2` to sort the `balance_info` list.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It initializes a list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It iterates over the string `s`, calculating the balance at each position and appending corresponding `BalanceInfo` objects to `balance_info`.
   - After collecting all balance information, it sorts `balance_info` using the key specified in the `sort` method, which ensures that the list is sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for ties.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `balance_info` objects and prints it.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated functions, the implementation of both functions aligns perfectly with the requirements. The `func_2` function correctly computes the balance of each prefix, sorts the information based on the specified criteria, and constructs the balanced shuffle as required.

Correctness: **True**
