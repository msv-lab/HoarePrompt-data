Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `balance` is either 1 or 0.
   - `balance_info` now contains two instances of `BalanceInfo`:
     - The first instance has:
       - `balance` of 1 if `s[0]` is '(', otherwise -1.
       - `i` of 0.
       - `s[0]` value.
     - The second instance has:
       - Updated `balance` (1 if `s[0]` is '(', 0 if `s[0]` is not '(').
       - `i` of 0.
       - `s[0]` value.
     - A new `BalanceInfo` instance is appended to the list with the current `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]` values.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, it will become 1 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as long as the condition `n > 0` holds true.
   - The `balance` value might change based on the character `s[i]` in the loop body, but we don't know the exact value yet.
   - The `balance_info` list will be updated based on the new `balance` and `i` value.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
- `i` will be incremented to 1.
- `balance` could change depending on `s[1]`.
- `balance_info` will be updated with the new `balance`, `i`, and `s[1]`.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 1.
- `balance` could be 1 if `s[1]` is '(', otherwise -1.
- `balance_info` will contain three instances:
  - First instance: `balance` of 1 if `s[0]` is '(', otherwise -1; `i` of 0; `s[0]` value.
  - Second instance: Updated `balance` (1 if `s[0]` is '(', 0 if `s[0]` is not '('); `i` of 0; `s[0]` value.
  - Third instance: New `balance`, `i` of 1, and `s[1]` value.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `balance` could be 1 or -1, `balance_info` now contains three instances of `BalanceInfo` with the first instance having either a `balance` of 1 (if `s[0]` is '(') or -1 (if `s[0]` is not '('), `i` of 0, and `s[0]` value, the second instance having the updated `balance` (1 if `s[0]` is '(' or 0 if `s[0]` is not '('), `i` of 0, and `s[0]` value, and the third instance having the current `balance`, `i` of 1, and `s[1]` value.**
