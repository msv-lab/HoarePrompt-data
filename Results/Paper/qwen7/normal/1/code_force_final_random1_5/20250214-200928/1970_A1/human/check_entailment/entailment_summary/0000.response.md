Reasoning:
- The problem requires us to implement a balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. The balanced shuffle operation involves calculating the balance of the prefixes, sorting based on the balance and position, and then forming a new sequence from the original characters but in the sorted order.
- We have two functions provided:
  1. `func_1`: This function compares two `BalanceInfo` objects and sorts them primarily by balance and secondarily by position. This function is used in the sorting process.
  2. `func_2`: This function performs the entire process of calculating balances, sorting, and printing the result.
- `func_2` correctly calculates the balance of the prefixes for each character in the input string `s`. It then creates a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, sorts them using the custom comparator from `func_1`, and finally constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted list.
- Given that the problem description matches the implementation in `func_2`, and the provided `func_1` correctly handles the sorting logic, the overall implementation should meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
