Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `balance` is 0, `balance_info` now contains two instances of `BalanceInfo` with the first instance having `balance` of 1 (or -1 if `s[0]` was not '('), `i` of 0, and `s[0]` value, and the second instance having the updated `balance` (which is 0), `i` of 0, and `s[0]` value, and a new `BalanceInfo` instance is appended to the list with the current `balance` of 0, `i` of 0, and `s[0]` value.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `balance` is either 1 (if `s[0]` is '(') or -1 (if `s[0]` is not '(').
- After executing `balance -= 1`, `balance` is decremented by 1. So, if `balance` was 1, it becomes 0; if it was -1, it remains -1.
- The `balance_info` list now contains two instances of `BalanceInfo`: the first one with the original `balance`, `i`, and `s[0]` values, and the second one with the updated `balance` of 0, `i` of 0, and `s[0]` value.
- A new `BalanceInfo` instance is appended to the list with the current `balance` of 0, `i` of 0, and `s[0]` value.
