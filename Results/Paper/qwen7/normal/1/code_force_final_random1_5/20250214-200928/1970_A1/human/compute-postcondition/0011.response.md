Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `balance` is either 1 if `s[0]` is '(', or `balance_info.balance` - 1 if `s[0]` is not an opening parenthesis ('(').
   - `balance_info` contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with the updated `balance` value, `i` value equal to 0, and `s[0]` value.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is determined by the initial condition and does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `balance` and `balance_info` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and their values are not affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `balance` is either 1 if `s[0]` is '(', or `balance_info.balance` - 1 if `s[0]` is not an opening parenthesis ('('), `balance_info` now contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with the updated `balance` value, `i` value equal to 0, and `s[0]` value.**
