Postcondition: `balance_info` now contains four instances: the first instance is `balance` of 2 if `s[0]` is '(', otherwise 0; `i` of 0; `s[0]` value; the second instance is updated `balance` (2 if `s[0] is '(', 0 if `s[0]` is not '('); `i` of 0; `s[0]` value; the third instance is new `balance`, `i` of 1, and `s[1]` value; `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '(', `balance` is incremented by 1 for the current instance; otherwise, `balance` is decremented by 2 for the current instance.
