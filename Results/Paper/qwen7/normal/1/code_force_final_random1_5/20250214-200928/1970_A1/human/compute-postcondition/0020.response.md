Output State: **`balance_info` now contains four instances: the first instance is `balance` of 0 if `s[0]` is '(', otherwise -2; `i` of 0; `s[0]` value; the second instance is updated `balance` (0 if `s[0]` is '(', 0 if `s[0]` is not '('); `i` of 0; `s[0]` value; the third instance is new `balance`, `i` of 1, and `s[1]` value; `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- For the first instance, the original `balance` was 1 if `s[0]` is '(', otherwise -1. After subtracting 1, the new `balance` is 0 if `s[0]` is '(', otherwise -2.
- For the second instance, the original `balance` was 1 if `s[0]` is '(', otherwise 0. After subtracting 1, the new `balance` is 0 if `s[0]` is '(', otherwise 0.
- The third instance remains unchanged because the code only affects the first two instances.
