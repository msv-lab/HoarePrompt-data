#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a balanced parentheses sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between infoA's balance and infoB's balance.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where both `balance` attributes are equal, and both `position` attributes represent the position of a character in a balanced parentheses sequence.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position attribute of infoB and the position attribute of infoA, where both attributes represent the position of a character in a balanced parentheses sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects containing `balance` and `position` attributes. Depending on whether the `balance` attributes of `infoA` and `infoB` are equal, the function returns either the difference between their `balance` values or the difference between their `position` values. Both `balance` and `position` are integers representing the balance and position of characters in a balanced parentheses sequence, respectively.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string s is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `balance_info` now contains `n` instances of `BalanceInfo`. Each instance has the following attributes:
    #- The `balance` value starts from 0 and changes based on the parentheses encountered during the iteration.
    #- The `i` value ranges from 0 to `n-1`, indicating the position of each character in the string `s`.
    #- The `s[i]` value is the character at position `i` in the string `s`.
    #
    #In summary, `balance_info` will contain one entry for each index in the string `s`, with each entry reflecting the balance of parentheses up to that point in the string. The `balance` attribute will show the net count of open parentheses minus closed ones at each step, starting from 0 at the beginning of the string and updating with each iteration through the loop.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: the string formed by concatenating the `character` attributes of all `info` objects in `balance_info`, sorted by `balance` in ascending order and by `position` in descending order for ties
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", processes it to calculate the balance of parentheses at each position, sorts the balance information based on the balance value and position, and prints a new string formed by the characters in `s` but ordered according to the sorted balance information.
