### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function `func_14()` in detail to determine if it correctly generates a sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The sequence `a` must be of size at most 25.
2. There should be no subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `k`.
3. For all `1 \le v \le n` where `v \ne k`, there must be a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

#### Function `func_14()` Analysis:
```python
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:
            return '1\n2'
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    else:
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
```

1. **Case when `k == 1`:**
   - If `n == 2`, the sequence is `[2, 3]`.
   - Otherwise, the sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and then includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

2. **Case when `k > 1`:**
   - The sequence includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
   - It also includes `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum `k` is not achievable.
   - It includes `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to further ensure the sum `k` is not achievable.
   - Finally, it includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

#### Verification:
- **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
  - The sequence avoids including any combination of elements that would sum to `k` by explicitly excluding such combinations (e.g., `k - 1 - sum(ans)`).
  - The inclusion of `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` ensures additional checks.

- **Subsequences Summing to All Other Values:**
  - Powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n` ensure that all values from `1` to `n-1` can be formed as subsequences.

Given the analysis, the function `func_14()` indeed generates a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. The original assessment incorrectly identified a flaw in the logic, but upon closer inspection, the function correctly handles the constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program correctly generates a sequence `a` that satisfies the problem's conditions for all test cases.
