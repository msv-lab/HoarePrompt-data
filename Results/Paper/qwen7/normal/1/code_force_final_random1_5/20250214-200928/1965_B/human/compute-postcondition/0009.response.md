Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the integer returned from `func_7()` and equals 1, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is [2, 3], and `n` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the list `[2, 3]` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` and confirms that the other variables retain their initial states.
