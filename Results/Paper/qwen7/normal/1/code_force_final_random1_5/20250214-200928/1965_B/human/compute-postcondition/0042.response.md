Output State: **The program returns a string containing space-separated integers. These integers include all the powers of 2 from \(2^{l-2}\) to \(2^l\), followed by the initial elements \([k + 1, 2 * k + 1, (k - 1 - \text{sum}(ans))]\), and then \(2^l\) if \(k\) is not 1.**

To break it down:
1. The variable `i` is defined as `l` if `k` is 1, otherwise `i` is `l - 1`.
2. The list `ans` is constructed as follows:
   - All powers of 2 from \(2^{l-2}\) to \(2^l\).
   - Followed by the initial elements \([k + 1, 2 * k + 1, (k - 1 - \text{sum}(ans))]\).
   - If `k` is not 1, append \(2^l\) to the list.

The `return ' '.join(map(str, ans))` statement converts each element in the list `ans` to a string and joins them with spaces, resulting in the final output string.
