Output State: **`i` is equal to `lk - 2`, `lk` must be greater than 3, `ans` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`, (k - 1 - sum(ans))**

Explanation: The code appends `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` originally contains `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1]`. After appending `2 * k + 1`, the updated list is `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
