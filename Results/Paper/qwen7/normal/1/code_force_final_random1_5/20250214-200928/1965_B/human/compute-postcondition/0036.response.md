Output State: **`i` is `lk - 1`, `ans` contains `[2, 2 ** (lk - 1)]**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is set to `lk - 1`. The variable `ans` initially contains the value `2`. The code appends `2 ** i` to `ans`, which means it appends `2 ** (lk - 1)` to `ans`. Since `ans` initially contained `[2]`, after appending `2 ** (lk - 1)`, `ans` now contains `[2, 2 ** (lk - 1)]`.
