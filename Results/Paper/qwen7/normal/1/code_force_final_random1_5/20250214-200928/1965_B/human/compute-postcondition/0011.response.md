Output State: **`i` is 2; `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to 2; `ans` contains the value 4 (which is 2 ** 2)**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, \(2^2 = 4\). The values of `i` and `l` remain unchanged, and `ans` now contains the value 4.
