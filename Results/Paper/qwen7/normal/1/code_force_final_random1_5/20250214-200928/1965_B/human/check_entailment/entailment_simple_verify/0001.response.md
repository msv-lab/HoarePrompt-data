### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of at most 25 non-negative integers.
- The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
- For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there must be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

#### Program Structure:
- The program defines several utility functions, but these are not used in the main logic.
- The main logic is encapsulated in `func_14()` which is called inside `func_15()`.

#### Function `func_14()`:
- This function takes two arguments `n` and `k`.
- It converts `n` and `k` to binary representations.
- If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where `n == 2`.
- Otherwise, it constructs a sequence `ans`:
  - If `k` is 1, it creates a sequence `[2, 3, 2^i for i in range(2, l)]`.
  - Otherwise, it creates a sequence `[2^i for i in range(lk - 1)] + [k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1] + [2^i for i in range(lk, l)]`.

#### Checking the Logic:
- The constructed sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` because the sequence includes specific values that prevent this.
- The sequence also ensures that every value from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by some subsequence due to the inclusion of powers of 2 and other carefully chosen values.

#### Output:
- The function returns a string representation of the sequence, which is then printed in `func_15()`.

### Verification:

- **Special Case Handling**:
  - When `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the sequence `[2, 3]` is correct because no subsequence sums to 1, and the subsequences `[2]` and `[3]` cover the values 2 and 3 respectively.
  
- **General Case**:
  - For `k > 1`, the sequence construction ensures that:
    - No subsequence sums to `k` because the sequence includes specific values like `k - 1 - sum(ans)` and `2 * k + 1` which prevent any subsequence from summing to `k`.
    - Every value from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by some subsequence due to the inclusion of powers of 2 and other carefully chosen values.

### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **For `k == 1`**:
   - Sequence: `[2, 3, 2^i for i in range(2, l)]`
   - Explanation: 
     - `2` and `3` ensure that no subsequence sums to `1`.
     - Powers of 2 (`2^i for i in range(2, l)`) ensure that all values from `4` to `2^l` can be formed.

2. **For `k > 1`**:
   - Sequence: `[2^i for i in range(lk - 1)] + [k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1] + [2^i for i in range(lk, l)]`
   - Explanation:
     - Powers of 2 (`2^i for i in range(lk - 1)`) ensure that all values from `1` to `2^(lk - 1)` can be formed.
     - `[k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` ensures that `k - 1`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` are included, preventing any subsequence from summing to `k`.
     - Remaining powers of 2 (`2^i for i in range(lk, l)`) ensure that all values from `2^lk` can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.
