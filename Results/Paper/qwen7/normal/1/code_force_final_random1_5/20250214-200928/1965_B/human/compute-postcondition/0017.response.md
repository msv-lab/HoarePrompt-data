Output State: `i` is equal to `l`; `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to 3; `ans` is [4, 8, 16, ..., 2 ** l]

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = l-1`. Given that the loop executed 3 times, `i` reached 4, meaning `l` must be at least 5 (since the loop starts at 2 and increments by 1 each time). Therefore, `i` will eventually equal `l`, and `ans` will contain all values from `2^2` to `2^l` in steps of 2.
