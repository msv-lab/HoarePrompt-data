Output State: **`i` is 2; `lk` must be greater than 3; `ans` is [1, 2, 4]**.

The code appends the value of \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, \(2^i\) equals 4. Therefore, the list `ans` changes from `[1, 2]` to `[1, 2, 4]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
