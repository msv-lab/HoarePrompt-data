Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the integer returned from `func_7()`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of `bk`, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `lk = len(bk)` calculates the length of the binary representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix) and assigns it to the variable `lk`. The other variables remain unchanged.
