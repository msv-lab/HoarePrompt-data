Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(l)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `l`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < l`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is less than `l`.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `ans` is a list with one element which is the character from `alp` list located at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` subtracted by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is less than `l`, the loop will continue if `j` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `l` remains unchanged as it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `ans` is derived based on the current value of `j`, so it will be updated based on the new value of `j` in the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is less than `l`, `l` is an input integer, `ans` is a list with one element which is the character from `alp` list located at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j+1]` in `rev_array[j+1:]` subtracted by 1**.
