Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `ans` remains the same, `array` is a reversed version of the original list of integers, `alp` is a list of characters from 'a' to 'z'**.

Explanation: The code `rev_array = array[::-1]` creates a reversed copy of the list `array` and assigns it to `rev_array`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `l`, `ans`, or `alp`. The original list `array` is now stored in `rev_array` in reverse order.
