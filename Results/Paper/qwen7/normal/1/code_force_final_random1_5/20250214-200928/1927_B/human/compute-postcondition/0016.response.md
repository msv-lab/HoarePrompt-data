`l` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`. The value of `j` remains equal to `l`, and the other variables (`array`, `rev_array`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is equal to `l`, which is now an input integer; `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is determined by counting the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]` and then accessing the corresponding index in the list `alp`; `i` is `i + 1`.
