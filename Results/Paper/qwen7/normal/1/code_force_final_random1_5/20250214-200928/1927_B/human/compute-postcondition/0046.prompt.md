Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the second line contains n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i < n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm',
        'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
    rev_array = array[::-1]
    ans = []
    for j in range(l):
        ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
    print(''.join(map(str, ans)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `j` is equal to `l`, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`, `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is the `(rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)`-th element of `alp`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `l`. The list `ans` will contain `l` elements, with each element being determined by counting the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]` and then accessing the corresponding index in the list `alp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `j` is less than or equal to `l`; `l` is an input integer; `ans` is a list with `l` elements where each element is the character from `alp` list located at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` subtracted by 1.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `l` (since the loop increments `j` until it reaches `l`), `l` remains the same as the input integer, and `ans` will contain `l` elements. Each element in `ans` corresponds to the character from `alp` based on the count of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist starting from `rev_array[j]` to the end of `rev_array`, adjusted by subtracting 1 from that count.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `j` is `l`, `l` must be greater than or equal to `l`, `ans` contains `l` elements. Each element in `ans` is the character from `alp` which is at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus 1, for each `j` from `0` to `l-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `l`, meaning the loop has executed `l` times. The list `ans` will contain `l` elements, where each element is determined by counting the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` from position `j` to the end of `rev_array`, finding the index of that count in the list `alp`, and then using that index to retrieve a character from `alp`. This process is repeated for each `j` from `0` to `l-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
