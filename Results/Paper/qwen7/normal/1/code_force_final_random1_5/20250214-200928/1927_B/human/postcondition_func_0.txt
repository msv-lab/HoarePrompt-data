The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) (indicating the number of subsequent test cases) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \). For each test case, it generates a string based on the count of each element in the reversed list of integers and maps these counts to corresponding characters from the alphabet. Finally, it prints the generated string for each test case.
