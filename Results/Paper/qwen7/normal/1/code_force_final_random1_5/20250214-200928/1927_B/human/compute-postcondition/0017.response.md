Output State: **`j` is equal to `l`, which is an input integer; `array` is updated to a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is determined by counting the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]` and then accessing the corresponding index in the list `alp`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `array`. The other variables (`j`, `rev_array`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and values, but the value of `array` is updated to reflect the new list of integers.
