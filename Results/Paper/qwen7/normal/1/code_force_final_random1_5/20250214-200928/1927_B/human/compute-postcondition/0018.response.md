Output State: **`j` is equal to `l`, which is an input integer; `array` is updated to a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer; `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is determined by counting the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]` and then accessing the corresponding index in the list `alp`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The given code initializes the `alp` list with 26 characters. However, this list does not affect any of the existing variables (`j`, `l`, `array`, `rev_array`, `ans`, `i`). The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains as `i + 1`. All other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
