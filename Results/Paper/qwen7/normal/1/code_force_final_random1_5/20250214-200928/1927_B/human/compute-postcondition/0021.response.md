Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` in the range of `l`. Therefore, the only variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initially equal to `l`.
   - `l` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate as long as `j < l`. Given that `j` starts as `l`, the loop will not execute because `j` is not less than `l` initially.

4. **Adjust the state to allow the loop to execute**: To make the loop execute, `j` must be less than `l`. This means `j` should be initialized to a value less than `l`.

5. **List the adjusted states**: The only variables that need adjustment are `j` and `l`. We need to ensure that `j` is less than `l`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`j` is less than `l`, `l` is an input integer**.
