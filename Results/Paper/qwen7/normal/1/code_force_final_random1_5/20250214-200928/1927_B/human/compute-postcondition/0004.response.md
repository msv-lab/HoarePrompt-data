Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`.**

The code `rev_array = array[::-1]` creates a new list `rev_array` that contains the elements of `array` in reverse order. The values of `t`, `l`, and `array` remain unchanged.
