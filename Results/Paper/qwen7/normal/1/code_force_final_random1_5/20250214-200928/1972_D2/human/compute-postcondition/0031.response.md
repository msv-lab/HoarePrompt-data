Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given by:
   \[
   (x + y) * x \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (x + y) * y \leq m
   \]

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( n \) is at least 9.
   - \( m \) is an integer greater than or equal to 12.
   - \( y \) is 2.
   - \( x \) is 2.
   - \( cnt \) is calculated as \( \min\left(\frac{n}{((x + y) * x)}, \frac{m}{((x + y) * y)}\right) \).

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition with Current Values:**
   - Substitute \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 2 \):
     \[
     (x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8
     \]
     \[
     (x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8
     \]
   - Check the conditions:
     \[
     8 \leq n \quad \text{(since \( n \) is at least 9, this condition is satisfied)}
     \]
     \[
     8 \leq m \quad \text{(since \( m \) is at least 12, this condition is satisfied)}
     \]

4. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted:**
   - The loop will continue as long as both conditions are true.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the loop condition remains true after the adjustment.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since \( n \) and \( m \) are already at least 9 and 12 respectively, they don't need to be adjusted further.
   - The values of \( x \) and \( y \) are fixed at 2, so they don't need to be adjusted either.
   - The only way to ensure the loop continues is to keep the conditions true. Given that the current values satisfy the conditions, no adjustment is necessary for these specific values.

### Conclusion:
Since the current values of \( n \) and \( m \) already satisfy the loop conditions, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is at least 9, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 12, `y` is 2, `x` is 2**
