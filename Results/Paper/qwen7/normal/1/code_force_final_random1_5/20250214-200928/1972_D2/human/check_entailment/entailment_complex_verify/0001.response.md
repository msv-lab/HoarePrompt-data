### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given `func_1()` function is incorrect. Let's break down why the original assessment is accurate and why the provided annotated code also confirms this.

1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**:
   - The original assessment points out that the line `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. This line attempts to increment the count based on some mathematical expression rather than checking the actual condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\).

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) is not being checked correctly. The original function does not have a proper mechanism to verify this condition for each pair \((x, y)\).

3. **Annotated Code Confirmation**:
   - The annotated code provides insights into the state of the program during execution. Specifically, it mentions that the state after the loops indicates that the function does not properly count the valid pairs. The final state of `cnt` remains unchanged, which aligns with the incorrect logic in the original function.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided `func_1()` function does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly count the number of valid pairs and does not check the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) correctly.
