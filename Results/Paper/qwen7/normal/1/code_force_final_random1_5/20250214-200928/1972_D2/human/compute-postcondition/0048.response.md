Postcondition: `n` is at least 9, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 12, `y` is 1, `x` is 3, and `cnt` is the sum of all valid `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` values where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. Additionally, it is currently true that `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`.
