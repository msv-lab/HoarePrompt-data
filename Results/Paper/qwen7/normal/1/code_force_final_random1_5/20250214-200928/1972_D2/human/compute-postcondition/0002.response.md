Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignments or operations that modify `t` are shown), the value of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with `t` being a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
