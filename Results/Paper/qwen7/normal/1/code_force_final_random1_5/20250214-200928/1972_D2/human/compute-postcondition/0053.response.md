To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will continue as long as both conditions are true:
1. \((x + y) * x \leq n\)
2. \((x + y) * y \leq m\)

Given the current state:
- \(n\) is at least 9
- \(m\) is an integer greater than or equal to 12
- \(y\) is 2
- \(x\) is 3
- \(cnt\) is the sum of all valid \(\min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))\) values where \(\mathit{gcd}(x, y) == 1\) and \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\), and \(cnt\) has been incremented by \(\min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))\) if \(\mathit{gcd}(x, y) == 1\).

Let's evaluate the conditions in the loop head:
- \((x + y) * x = (3 + 2) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15\)
- \((x + y) * y = (3 + 2) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10\)

Since \(n\) is at least 9 and \(m\) is at least 12, the conditions \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\) are satisfied because \(15 > 9\) and \(10 \leq 12\).

For the loop to execute one more time, the values of \(x\) and \(y\) need to change such that either \((x + y) * x > n\) or \((x + y) * y > m\). However, since we are asked to adjust the states based on the loop head, we need to consider the changes in \(x\) and \(y\) that would break these conditions.

Since \(x\) and \(y\) are fixed at 3 and 2 respectively, the only way to break the conditions is to increase \(n\) or decrease \(m\). Therefore, we need to adjust \(n\) and \(m\) to ensure the loop does not continue.

State: **`n` must be less than 15, `m` must be less than 10**
