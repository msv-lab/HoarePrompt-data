Output State: `n` must be less than 15, `m` must be less than 10, `y` is 4, `x` is 3, and `cnt` remains unchanged.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `y` until the condition `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m` is met. Given that the output state after 3 iterations shows `n` < 15 and `m` < 10, it means that the loop terminates before all possible increments of `y` can be made. Therefore, `y` will be 4 after the loop finishes. Since the conditions for updating `cnt` are not met in the last iteration (as shown in the output state after 3 iterations), `cnt` remains unchanged.
