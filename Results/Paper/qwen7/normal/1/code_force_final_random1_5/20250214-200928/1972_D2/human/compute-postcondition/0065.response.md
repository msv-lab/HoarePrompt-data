Output State: `n` is less than 15, `m` is less than 10, `y` is 4, `x` is 4, and `cnt` remains unchanged.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the conditions specified in the final output state after the loop executes 3 times are met. Specifically, `n` must be less than 15, `m` must be less than 10, `y` is set to 4, `x` is set to 4, and `cnt` does not change because the loop terminates when `x * x > n`, which happens when `x` reaches 4 given that `n` is less than 15.
