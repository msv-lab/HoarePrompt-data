Postcondition: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, and `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 6. If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is increased by the minimum value between `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. If the gcd of `x` and `y` is not 1, `cnt` remains unchanged.
