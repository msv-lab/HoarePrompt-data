Output State: `n` is less than 15, `m` is less than 10, `y` is 4, `x` is 4, and `cnt` remains unchanged.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the conditions in the loop head (`while x * x <= n`) and the inner loop head (`while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`) dictate that the loop will stop when `x * x > n` or either `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`. Given the final state after 3 iterations, we know that `x` is 4, `n` is less than 15, and `m` is less than 10. Since `x` increments by 1 each iteration and starts at 1, the loop will stop when `x` reaches 4 because increasing `x` further would make `x * x > n`. The value of `y` remains 4 as it does not change within the loop once the outer loop's condition is met. The variable `cnt` remains unchanged because none of the conditions inside the loops would allow further increments of `x` or `y` that satisfy all the constraints.
