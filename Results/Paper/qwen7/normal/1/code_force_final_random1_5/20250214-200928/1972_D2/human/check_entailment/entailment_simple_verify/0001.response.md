### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the given `func_1()` function. Let's break down the analysis again to confirm the correctness of the original assessment.

1. **Initialization and Outer Loop**:
   - `x` starts from 1 and iterates up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - The outer loop ensures that \(x\) stays within the bounds of \(1 \leq x \leq \sqrt{n}\).

2. **Inner Loop**:
   - `y` starts from 1 and iterates up to a point where \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - This ensures that \(y\) stays within the bounds of \(1 \leq y \leq \frac{m}{x + y}\).

3. **GCD Check**:
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` checks if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.

4. **Count Calculation**:
   - The current logic uses `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` to update the count. This is incorrect because it does not properly check the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\).

### Issues Identified
- **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The use of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. It does not count the number of valid pairs correctly.
- **Condition Check**: The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) is not checked correctly. The current logic does not ensure that this condition holds true.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition directly:
```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    print(cnt)
```

### Final Evaluation
Given the analysis, the original assessment correctly identified the issues with the provided `func_1()` function. The current implementation does not correctly count the number of valid pairs and does not check the condition properly.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer
Final: **False**
