You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, it calls `func_1()` exactly once without accepting or returning any direct values. After processing all test cases, `t` is set to 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Problem Description
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Given Code
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function iterates over multiple test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### `func_1()` Function
```python
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)
```

#### Analysis of `func_1()`
1. **Initialization**: `x` starts from 1 and `cnt` is initialized to 0.
2. **Outer Loop**: The loop runs while \(x^2 \le n\). This ensures that \(x\) does not exceed \(\sqrt{n}\).
3. **Inner Loop**: For each \(x\), the inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This ensures that both \(a\) and \(b\) stay within their respective bounds.
4. **GCD Check**: If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it checks whether \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). This is done by comparing \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) with \(a + b\).
5. **Count Calculation**: The count is updated using `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`. This part seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs but is incorrect because it does not properly check the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\).

#### Issues in `func_1()`
1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The use of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. It does not properly count the number of valid pairs.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) is not checked correctly. The current logic does not ensure that this condition holds true.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition directly:
```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    print(cnt)
```

### Conclusion
The given `func_1()` function is incorrect because it does not properly count the number of valid pairs and does not check the condition correctly. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

#### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
