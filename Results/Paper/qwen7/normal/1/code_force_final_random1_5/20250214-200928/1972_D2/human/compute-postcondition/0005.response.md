Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. This means the loop variable is `_` (a placeholder) and the loop will iterate `t` times.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is 1.

3. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1. Since `t` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be 0.

4. **Final state**: The loop will not execute again because `t` is now 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is 0**
