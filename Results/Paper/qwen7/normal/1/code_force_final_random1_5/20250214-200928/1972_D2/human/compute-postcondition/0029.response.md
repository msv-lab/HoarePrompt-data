Postcondition: `n` is at least 9, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 12, `y` is 1, `x` is 2, and `cnt` is `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`, since the condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is always true (as `x` is 2 and `y` is 1, their greatest common divisor is 1), and thus the if part is always executed, updating `cnt` accordingly.
