Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the minimum value between `n / ((x + y) * x)` (where `n` is greater than or equal to 3) and `m // ((x + y) * y)` (where `m` is greater than or equal to 6), and `x` and `y` are unspecified variables.**

This means that `cnt` has been updated by adding the smaller of the two calculated values, but the exact numerical value cannot be determined without knowing the values of `x` and `y`. The conditions for `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
