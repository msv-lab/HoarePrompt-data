Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the minimum value between `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`, `n` must be less than 15, `m` must be less than 10.**

This means that `cnt` is updated by adding the smaller value between `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. The conditions for `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
