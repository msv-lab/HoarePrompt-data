Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `start` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2.
   - `nums[start]` is decreased by 1, but since we are only asked about the print statement and not the modification of `nums`, this detail does not affect the output of the print statement directly.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(start + 1)`.
   - We need to evaluate `start + 1`.

Given that `start` is 2, the expression `start + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1`, which is `3`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **3**
