### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program based on the provided problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts first and picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `a`.
- Bob picks an element from `a` and removes it.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The goal is to find the MEX of `c` at the end of the game, where both players play optimally.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.
- It iterates through the numbers, marking them as visited and decrementing their counts.
- If it finds a sequence where the next number exists and is not yet visited, it moves to the next number.
- Otherwise, it prints the current number and terminates.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - The initial assessment concluded that the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game rules and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
   - This conclusion is based on the fact that `func_1` does not handle the alternating turns of Alice and Bob and the removal of elements by Bob.

2. **Detailed Evaluation**:
   - **Turn-Based Game Logic**: The function `func_1` does not simulate the turn-based nature of the game. Alice and Bob should take turns picking elements, but the function only processes the elements in a linear manner without considering whose turn it is.
   - **Element Removal by Bob**: The function `func_1` does not account for Bob removing elements from `a`. Instead, it simply processes the elements in the order they appear in `arr`.
   - **Optimal Strategy**: The function `func_1` does not implement the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, and Bob aims to minimize it. The function does not consider these objectives.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly implement the game, we need to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - Alice should pick an element, append it to `c`, and remove it from `a`.
   - Bob should pick an element and remove it from `a`.
   - We need to keep track of the elements picked by Alice and Bob and ensure the MEX is calculated correctly at the end.

#### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly simulate the game rules and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the game logic and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
