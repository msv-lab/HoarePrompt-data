Output State: **`start` is 0; `vis` is a set containing 0; `nums.get(0, 0)` must be non-zero**

The code `vis.add(start)` adds the value of `start` (which is 0) to the set `vis`. Since `vis` was initially an empty set, after adding `start`, `vis` contains the element 0. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition that `nums.get(0, 0)` must be non-zero is still valid.
