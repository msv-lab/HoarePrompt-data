Output State: **`start` is 0; `vis` is a set containing 0; `nums.get(0, 0)` is now -1; the current value of `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is falsy**

Explanation: The code `nums[start + 1] -= 1` decrements the value of `nums[start + 1]` by 1. Given that `start` is 0, `nums[start + 1]` is `nums[1]`. Initially, `nums.get(1, 0)` is truthy, meaning it is not zero. Since we are subtracting 1 from it, the value of `nums[1]` becomes -1, which is falsy. All other variables remain unchanged.
