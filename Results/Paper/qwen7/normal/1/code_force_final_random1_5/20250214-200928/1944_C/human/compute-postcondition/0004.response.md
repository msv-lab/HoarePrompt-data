Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `nums.get(start, 0)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is truthy (i.e., non-zero).

2. **Current state**: 
   - `start` is 0.
   - `vis` is an empty set.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `nums.get(start, 0)` must be truthy.
   - Since `start` is currently 0, we need to check if `nums.get(0, 0)` is truthy.
   - If `nums` is a dictionary, `nums.get(0, 0)` will return the value at key `0` or `0` if the key does not exist. For the loop to execute, this value must be non-zero.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to ensure that `nums.get(0, 0)` is non-zero for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `nums.get(0, 0)` is non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is 0, `vis` is an empty set, and `nums.get(0, 0)` must be non-zero**
