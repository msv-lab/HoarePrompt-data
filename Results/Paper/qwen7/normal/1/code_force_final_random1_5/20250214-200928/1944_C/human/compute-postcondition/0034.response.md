Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is 4.
- `vis` is a set containing 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- `nums[4]` is decreased by 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(start)
```

Given the precondition:
- `start` is explicitly stated to be 4.
- The value of `nums[4]` is not directly relevant to the `print(start)` statement, as it only prints the value of `start`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `start`, which is 4.

Output: **4**
