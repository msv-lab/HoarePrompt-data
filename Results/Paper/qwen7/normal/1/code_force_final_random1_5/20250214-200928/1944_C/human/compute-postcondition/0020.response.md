Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `start` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `vis` is a set containing the values 0 and 1.
   - `nums[1]` is a truthy value, which in Python typically means it's a non-zero number or a boolean `True`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(start + 1)
   ```

3. **Execution**:
   - The expression `start + 1` is evaluated.
   - Since `start` is 1, `start + 1` evaluates to 2.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the integer 2.

Output: **2**
