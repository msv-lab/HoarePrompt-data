Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `a`.
   - Bob picks an element from `a` and removes it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to find the MEX of `c` at the end of the game, where both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Alice can choose any element from `a` and append it to `c`.
   - Bob can only remove elements from `a`.
   - The MEX of `c` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code includes some commented-out functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) which are not used in the main logic.
   - The main logic is in `func_1`, which uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `nums = c.Counter(arr)` creates a counter of the elements in `arr`.
   - `start = 0` initializes the starting index.
   - `vis = set()` keeps track of visited indices.
   - The `while` loop runs until `nums[start]` becomes zero.
     - `vis.add(start)` marks the current index as visited.
     - `nums[start] -= 1` decrements the count of the current element.
     - If `nums[start + 1]` is non-zero, it moves to the next index.
     - Otherwise, it prints `start + 1` and returns.
   - If the loop exits, it prints `start`.

5. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will try to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - The optimal strategy involves ensuring that the smallest missing integer is maximized.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game rules.
   - It does not account for Alice and Bob's turns or the removal of elements by Bob.
   - It does not handle the game state correctly, especially the alternation between Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the game logic and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
