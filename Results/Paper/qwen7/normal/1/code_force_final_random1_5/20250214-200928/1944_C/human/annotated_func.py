#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\), with \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).
def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: Output State: `start` is 4; `vis` is a set containing 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4; `nums[4]` is decreased by 1.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is truthy. After the third iteration, `start` is 3, `vis` contains 0, 1, 2, and 3, and `nums[3]` has been decremented. For the fourth iteration, `start` is incremented to 4. Since the problem does not specify the exact values in `nums`, we assume that `nums[4]` is truthy (otherwise, the loop would terminate). Therefore, `nums[4]` is decremented, and `start` is incremented to 5. However, since the problem asks for the state after all iterations and we know the loop will terminate when `nums.get(start, 0)` is falsy, the final state is with `start` being 4, `vis` containing 0 through 4, and `nums[4]` having been decremented once.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: 4
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `arr` and processes it using a counter to track the frequency of each number. It iterates through the numbers, marking them as visited and decrementing their counts. If it finds a sequence where the next number exists and is not yet visited, it moves to the next number. Otherwise, it prints the current number and terminates. The function does not return any value.
