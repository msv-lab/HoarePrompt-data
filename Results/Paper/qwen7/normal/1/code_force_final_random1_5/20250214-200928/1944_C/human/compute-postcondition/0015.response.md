Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `nums.get(start, 0)`. This means the loop continues as long as `nums[start]` is truthy (not falsy).

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start` is 1
   - `vis` is a set containing 0
   - The current value of `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is falsy (meaning `nums[2]` is falsy)

3. **Determine what needs to change for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `nums[start]` must be truthy.
   - Since `start` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `nums[1]` is truthy.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to adjust the value of `nums[1]` to be truthy.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `nums[1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is 1; `vis` is a set containing 0; `nums[1]` must be truthy**
