Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is (y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15, `m` is 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4, and the current value of `m` is less than `a`.**

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated to `z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. Given that `z` was initially `(y + 1) // 2`, the new value of `z` becomes `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
