Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - `z` is \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\), where \(m = 15 \cdot \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) - y \cdot 4\).
   - If the current value of `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\).

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(a):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

5. **Post-Iteration State:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `a` remains the same as the initial value.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` becomes 1.
- `a` remains the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\), where \(m = 15 \cdot \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) - y \cdot 4\), and if the current value of `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\).**
