Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
- We need to calculate the minimum number of screens required to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons.
- Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means each screen can hold up to 15 icons (since \(5 \times 3 = 15\)).

### Given Program Breakdown
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - It calculates `z` as `(y + 1) // 2`. This seems to be an attempt to account for the 2x2 icons since each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, and we need to fit them into the available space.
   - Then, it calculates `m` as `15 * z - y * 4`. This formula might be intended to estimate the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons, but it does not seem to correctly account for the 1x1 icons.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - If `m < a`, it adjusts `z` by adding `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` to `z`. This part seems to be an attempt to handle the remaining 1x1 icons, but the logic is flawed.

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Space**:
   - The calculation `15 * z - y * 4` does not accurately represent the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, but the total capacity of a screen is 15 cells, so the remaining space should be calculated differently.

2. **Handling of Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The adjustment `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the placement of 1x1 icons in the remaining space.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Determine how many additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate screens needed for 2x2 icons
        z = (y + 3) // 4
        # Calculate remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = 15 * z - y * 4
        # Calculate screens needed for 1x1 icons
        m = (x + remaining_space - 1) // remaining_space
        print(z + m)

func()
```

### Conclusion
Given the issues in the original program and the need for a correct approach, the original program is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: False**
