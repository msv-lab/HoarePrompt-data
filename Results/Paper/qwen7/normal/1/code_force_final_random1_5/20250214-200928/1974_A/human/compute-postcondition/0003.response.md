Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`**.

This means that `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`, where `//` denotes integer division. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
