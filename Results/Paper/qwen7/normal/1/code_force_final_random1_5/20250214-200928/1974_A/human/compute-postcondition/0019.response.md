Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(a)`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: At the start of the first iteration, `i` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < a`.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - `z` is \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\), where \(m = 15 \cdot ((y + 1) // 2) - y \cdot 4\).
   - If `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\); otherwise, `z` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2 if the loop continues.
   - The values of `a`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, they stay the same.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < a`. Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration, and the loop will continue as long as `2 < a`.

6. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `y` remains the same.
   - `z` remains the same unless `m` is updated, but since `m` is not updated in this context, `z` stays the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\), `m` is \(15 \cdot ((y + 1) // 2) - y \cdot 4\)**.
