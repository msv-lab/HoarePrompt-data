Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 4`, `l` is `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`**.

In this output state, the variables `q`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, and `v2` retain their previous values or expressions. Specifically, `v2` is now assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, which is the same operation performed on `pf[l - 1]` using the dictionary `mp`.
