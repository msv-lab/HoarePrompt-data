Output State: **`q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `idx` is 4 * (n + 1), `l` and `r` are the last integers from `data[idx]` and `data[idx + 1]` respectively, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` and `v2` are lists obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])` and `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` respectively, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted into `v2` to keep it sorted minus one, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)`, with the last element being an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `q` to be the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
