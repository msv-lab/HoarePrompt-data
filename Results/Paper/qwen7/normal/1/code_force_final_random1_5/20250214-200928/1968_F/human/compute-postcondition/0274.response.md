Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the components involved in the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement:

1. **`results`**: This variable contains a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each query checked within the loop, followed by multiple empty strings, indicating the end of each query block and the final state of the loop.

2. **`\n`.join(results)**: This joins all the elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). 

Given that `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' responses and possibly empty strings, the output will be a series of these responses, each on a new line, followed by any empty strings, which would result in blank lines.

Therefore, the output will be a formatted string with each response on a new line, and any empty strings will result in blank lines.

Output: **YES\nNO\n\n\n... (where each 'YES' or 'NO' is a response from the queries, and the empty strings result in blank lines)**
