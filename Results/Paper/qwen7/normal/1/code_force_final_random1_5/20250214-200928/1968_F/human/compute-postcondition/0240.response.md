Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `l` is `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code `l = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `l`. The value of `q` remains a positive integer minus 1, and `idx` is increased by 2. Therefore, the updated states are as described.
