Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 4`, `l` is `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `x` as the bitwise XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. The values of `q`, `idx`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
