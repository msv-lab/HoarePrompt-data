Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (an underscore) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables**:
   - `idx` is 2.
   - `t` is an integer from `data[0]`.
   - `data` is a list of strings.
   - `n` and `q` are not yet defined as integers.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
   - `results` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - Other variables like `idx`, `data`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and `results` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
