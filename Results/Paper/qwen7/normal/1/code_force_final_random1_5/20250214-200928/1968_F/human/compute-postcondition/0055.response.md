Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to keep the list sorted.**

Explanation: The code performs a binary search using `bisect.bisect_left` to find the insertion point for `l` in the list `v1`. This operation does not change the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, or `v2`, but it assigns the result of the binary search to `it1`. Therefore, the output state includes all the original variables and the new variable `it1` with its calculated value.
