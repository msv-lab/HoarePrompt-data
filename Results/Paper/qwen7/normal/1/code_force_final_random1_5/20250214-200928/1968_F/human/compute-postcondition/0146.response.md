Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one.**

Explanation: The code calculates the index `it2` using `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. This means `it2` is the position where `r` would be inserted into `v2` to maintain the sorted order, but it is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
