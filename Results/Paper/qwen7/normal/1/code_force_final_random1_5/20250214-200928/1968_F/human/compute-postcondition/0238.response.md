Postcondition: **`q` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and the list `results` has either appended 'YES' twice or 'NO'. `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index of the first occurrence in `v1` that is not less than `r` and `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` that is just smaller than `l`. The condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l` is true in the if part, and the condition `it1 >= len(v1)` or `it2 < 0` or `v1[it1] > r` or `v2[it2] < l` is true in the else part.**
