Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 4`, `l` is `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted (using bisect_left).**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` inserts the value of `l` into the list `v1` while maintaining the sorted order. The function `bisect_left` returns the index where `l` should be inserted. The values of `q`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged from their previous states.
