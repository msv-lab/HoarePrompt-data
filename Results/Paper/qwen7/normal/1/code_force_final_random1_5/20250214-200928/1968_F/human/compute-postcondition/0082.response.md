Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is the integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is updated to the integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element just before `r` in `v2` using binary search.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. Initially, `idx` was increased by 4, so now it is increased by a total of 6. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
