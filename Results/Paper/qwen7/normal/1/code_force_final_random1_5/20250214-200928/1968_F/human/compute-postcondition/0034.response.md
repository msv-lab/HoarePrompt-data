Output State: **`a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the index `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pf[i]` to be the bitwise XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `pf[i]` based on the given formula, while the other variables retain their original values and conditions.
