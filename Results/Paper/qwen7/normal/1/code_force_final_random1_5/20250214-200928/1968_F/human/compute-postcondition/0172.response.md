Output State: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `idx` is increased by 7, `l` is int(data[idx]), `r` is int(data[idx + 1]), `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, and `results` is either appended with 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`; `x` is updated to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
