Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx + 1]` to the variable `r`. The values of `q` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `q` must be greater than 0 and `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]` remains valid.
