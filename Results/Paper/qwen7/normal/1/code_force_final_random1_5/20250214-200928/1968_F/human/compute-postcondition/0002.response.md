Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings, `n` and `q` are not yet defined as integers, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}, and each query consists of l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `data`, converted to an integer using `int()`. The index `idx` is incremented by 1 because the first element of `data` has been processed. The other variables remain unchanged.
