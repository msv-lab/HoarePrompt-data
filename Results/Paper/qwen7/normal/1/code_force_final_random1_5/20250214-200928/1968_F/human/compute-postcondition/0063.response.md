Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `l`. The condition that `q` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `q` must still be greater than 0, and `l` now holds the integer value from `data[idx]`.
