Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is the integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is updated to the integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` contains 'YES', `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element just before `r` in `v2` using binary search.**

Explanation: The code appends 'YES' to the `results` list. This operation does not affect the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, or `it2`. Therefore, their previous values remain unchanged. The only change is that `results` now contains 'YES'.
