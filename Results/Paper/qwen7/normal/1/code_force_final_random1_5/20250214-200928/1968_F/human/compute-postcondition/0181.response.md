Output State: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `idx` is increased by 7, `l` is int(data[idx]), `r` is int(data[idx + 1]), `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, `results` is now `results.append('NO')`, and `it2` is bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`. This does not affect the values of `q`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `results` except for adding 'NO' to `results`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `results` list with 'NO' appended.
