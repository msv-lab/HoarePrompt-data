Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now `n + 1`. Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop runs `n` times. Therefore, `i` will be `n + 1` after all iterations. The variable `idx` will be increased by `n` (since it increases by 1 in each iteration and the loop runs `n` times). Thus, `idx` will be `4 * (n + 2) + n`.

The prefix function `pf` will have been updated such that `pf[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n + 1` will be the XOR of `pf[i-1]` and `a[i]`. This means `pf[i]` will store the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of the list `a`.

The dictionary `mp` will contain entries for each unique value in `pf`, mapping each value to a list of indices where that value appears in `pf`. Each entry in `mp` will have been updated during the loop as described.

In summary, the final output state is characterized by `i` being `n + 1`, `idx` being `4 * (n + 2) + n`, `pf` having been updated according to the XOR operation for each element in `a`, and `mp` containing the updated mappings of each unique value in `pf` to their respective indices.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and the list `results` has either appended 'YES' twice or 'NO'. `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index of the first occurrence in `v1` that is not less than `r` and `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` that is just smaller than `l`. The condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l` is true in the if part, and the condition `it1 >= len(v1)` or `it2 < 0` or `v1[it1] > r` or `v2[it2] < l` is true in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 4`, `l` is `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted (using bisect_left), `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` contains either `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions specified in the if and else parts.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 11`, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is reassigned to `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted (previously calculated), `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is `['YES', 'YES']` if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, `results` is `['NO']`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
