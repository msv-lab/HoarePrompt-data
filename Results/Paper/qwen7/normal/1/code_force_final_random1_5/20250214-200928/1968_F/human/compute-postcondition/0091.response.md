Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is the integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is updated to the integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` contains 'YES', `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` now contains 'YES' appended.**

Explanation: The code `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
