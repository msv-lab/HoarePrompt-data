Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is increased by 4 * (n + 1), `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`, `a` is now a list of length `n + 1` initialized to 0, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to 0, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value was calculated, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, and the last element appended to `results` is an empty string; `mp` is updated to include {(0): [0]}, `q` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2; `idx` is increased by 1; `a[1]` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`; `pf[1]` is `pf[0]` XOR `a[1]`; `mp[pf[1]]` is an empty list appended with 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3, `idx` is 4, `a[1]` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, `pf[1]` is `pf[0]` XOR `a[1]`, `pf[3]` is `pf[2]` XOR `a[3]`, `mp[pf[3]].append(3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4, `idx` is 5, `a[1]` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, `pf[1]` is `pf[0]` XOR `a[1]`, `pf[3]` is `pf[2]` XOR `a[3]`, `mp[pf[3]]` contains the value [3], `pf[4]` is `pf[3]` XOR `a[4]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
