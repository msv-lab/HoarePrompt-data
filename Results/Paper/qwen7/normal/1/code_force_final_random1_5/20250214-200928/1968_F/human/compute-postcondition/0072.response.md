Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 4; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains 'YES' if `x == 0`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`**

Explanation: The code retrieves two values from the dictionary `mp` using keys `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. These values are stored in `v1` and `v2` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
