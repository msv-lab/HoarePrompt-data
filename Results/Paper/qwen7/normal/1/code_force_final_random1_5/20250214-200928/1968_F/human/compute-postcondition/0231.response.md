Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and the list `results` has appended 'YES'; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`**.

This means that the variable `v2` now holds the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, which is the same as what `v1` held before (since `v1` was assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`). The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
