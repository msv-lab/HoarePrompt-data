Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input data and processes it according to the problem description.
2. It initializes the necessary variables and structures (prefix XOR array `pf`, mapping dictionary `mp`, and result list `results`).
3. For each test case, it calculates the prefix XOR values and stores them in `pf`.
4. It uses a dictionary `mp` to map each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that value was calculated.
5. For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from index `l-1` to `r-1` using the prefix XOR values.
6. If the XOR is zero, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.
7. The program handles multiple test cases and separates their results with empty lines.
8. The logic for checking if a subarray is interesting is implemented correctly, and the use of binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) ensures efficient querying of the indices stored in `mp`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem specification accurately.

Correctness: **True**
