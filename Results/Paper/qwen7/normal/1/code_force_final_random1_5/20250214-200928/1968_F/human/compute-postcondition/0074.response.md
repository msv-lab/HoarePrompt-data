Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 4; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains 'YES' if `x == 0`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index of the element just before `r` in `v2` using binary search (bisect.bisect_left).**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `it2` to be the index of the element just before `r` in `v2` using `bisect.bisect_left`. This does not affect the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `results`, `v1`, and `v2`. The value of `it1` is not updated, and the value of `it2` is now the index of the element just before `r` in `v2`.
