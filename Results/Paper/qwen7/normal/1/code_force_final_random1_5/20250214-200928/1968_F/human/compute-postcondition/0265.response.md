Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 11`, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is reassigned to `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted (previously calculated), `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` is now `['YES']` if `x == 0`, and remains unchanged as `['YES']` or `['NO']` otherwise, and `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `it1` to be the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep `v1` sorted. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `it1` is calculated based on the current values of `l` and `v1`.
