Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `q` is the integer value from `data[idx + 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx + 1]` to the variable `q`. The value of `q` is specifically the integer value from `data[idx + 1]`. The conditions and values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
