Postcondition: `i` is 4; `n` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2; `pf[1]` is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`; `pf[2]` is either not in `mp` or `mp[pf[2]]` is an empty list; `mp[pf[3]].append(3)`; `a[4]` is an integer from `data[idx]`; `pf[4]` is `pf[3] ^ a[4]`; if `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i]]` becomes an empty list.
