You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case consists of n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}, and each query consists of l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        q = int(data[idx + 1])
        
        idx += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)

                mp[pf[i]] = []
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
            v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
            it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')

    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `idx` is `4 * (n + 2) + n`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in `data` up to the point where `idx` points beyond the last element. The list `a` is fully populated with integers from the data starting from `data[idx - 2]` up to `data[idx - 2 + n]`. The list `pf` is also fully populated such that each element `pf[i]` is the result of the prefix XOR operation up to index `i` in `a`. The dictionary `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value was calculated. The variable `results` contains a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each query checked within the loop, followed by multiple empty strings, indicating the end of each query block and the final state of the loop.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: YES\nNO\n\n\n... (where each 'YES' or 'NO' is a response from the queries, and the empty strings result in blank lines)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer `t`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`. The function returns results based on the specified range `[l, r]` within the list `a`.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
