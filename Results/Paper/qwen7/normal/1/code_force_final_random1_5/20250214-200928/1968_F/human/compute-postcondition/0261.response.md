The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the only thing we can infer is that the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop if there was one. No variables are modified or new values are assigned within this statement.

Given the initial state and the fact that no changes occur due to the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 11`, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` is now `['YES']` based on the appended value.**
