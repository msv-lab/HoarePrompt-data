Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now `n + 1`. The variable `idx` is `4 * (n + 2) + n`, reflecting the total number of steps taken within the loop. The list `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions specified. The prefix function `pf` has been updated such that `pf[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n + 1` stores the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of the list `a`. The dictionary `mp` contains the updated mappings of each unique value in `pf` to their respective indices.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes running all its iterations:
- The counter `i` will be `n + 1`.
- The index pointer `idx` will be `4 * (n + 2) + n`, indicating the total number of steps executed.
- The `results` list will contain the outcomes ('YES' or 'NO') for each query processed.
- The `pf` list will hold the cumulative XOR values for the elements of `a` up to each index.
- The `mp` dictionary will map each unique cumulative XOR value to the list of indices where it appears in the `pf` list.
