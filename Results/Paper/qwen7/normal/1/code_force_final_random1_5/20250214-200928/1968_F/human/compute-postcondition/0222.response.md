Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `r` is an integer from `data[idx + 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx + 1]` to the variable `r`. Since `data[idx + 1]` is converted to an integer using `int()`, `r` now holds the integer value from `data[idx + 1]`. The values of `q` and `l` remain unchanged.
