Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[1]` is int(data[idx])**.

The code `a[i] = int(data[idx])` assigns the value of `int(data[idx])` to the index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is initially 1, this assignment sets `a[1]` to `int(data[idx])`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
