Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 3, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value from `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 3, `a[1]` is an integer value from `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The line `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was increased by 2, so now it is increased by 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
