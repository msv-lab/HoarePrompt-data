Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `q` must be greater than 0, `idx` will be increased by twice the value of `n + 1`, `results` will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, `v1` and `v2` will be updated according to the values of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` respectively, and `it1` and `it2` will be the indices used for binary search operations to check the conditions for appending 'YES' or 'NO' to `results`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `idx` will have been incremented by twice the sum of `n + 1` (where `n` is derived from the data), `results` will contain a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration, and the variables `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` will reflect the final states determined by the loop's operations.
