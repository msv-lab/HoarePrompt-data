Reasoning:
1. The program reads the input correctly, splitting it into multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it initializes necessary variables and structures.
3. It constructs a prefix XOR array (`pf`) where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
4. It uses a dictionary (`mp`) to map each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that XOR value occurs.
5. For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from index `l-1` to `r-1` using the prefix XOR array.
6. If the XOR of the subarray is zero, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.
7. The logic for checking if the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values seems correct, as it leverages the prefix XOR array and the stored indices in the dictionary.
8. The program handles the separation between test cases correctly by appending an empty string after processing all queries for a test case.

Given the execution summary and the detailed reasoning above, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
