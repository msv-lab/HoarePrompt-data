The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a list of integers `a` and a set of queries. For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray from index `l-1` to `r-1` is zero. If the XOR is zero, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all queries for each test case, it appends an empty string to separate the results of different test cases. Finally, it prints the results, one per line, with empty lines separating the results of different test cases.
