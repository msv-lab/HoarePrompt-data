Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` and its current value is 0, and the list `results` has appended 'YES'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. This operation does not affect the values of `q`, `l`, `idx`, or `x`. The value of `x` remains unchanged at 0, and `idx` is incremented by 2 as per the initial state.
