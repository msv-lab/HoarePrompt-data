Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 4; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains 'YES' if `x == 0`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` using binary search (bisect_left).**

This means that the variable `it1` has been assigned the index of the first occurrence of the value `l` in the list `v1` using the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module. All other variables remain in their previous states.
