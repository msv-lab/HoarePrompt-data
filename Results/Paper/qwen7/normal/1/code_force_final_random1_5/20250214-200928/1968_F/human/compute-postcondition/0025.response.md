Output State: **`a[i]' is now the value of `int(data[idx])', `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[i]' is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]'**.

This means that the value of `a[i]` remains the same as `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented by 1, and `pf[i]` is calculated as the bitwise XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
