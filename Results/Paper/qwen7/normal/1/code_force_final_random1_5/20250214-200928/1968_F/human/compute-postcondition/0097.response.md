Output State: **The loop executes `q` times. After all iterations, `idx` is increased by `2 * (n + 1)`, where `n` is the maximum value of `len(a) - 1` encountered during the loop's execution. The list `a` is fully populated with integers from the data starting from `data[idx - 2]` up to `data[idx - 2 + n]`. The list `pf` is also fully populated such that each element `pf[i]` is the result of the prefix XOR operation up to index `i` in `a`. The dictionary `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value was calculated. The variable `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop. The last element appended to `results` is an empty string.**

This means that after the loop completes, the `results` list now has one additional element which is an empty string, while all other conditions and values remain unchanged as described in the initial state.
