Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, and either `it1 >= len(v1)` or `it2 < 0` or `v1[it1] > r` or `v2[it2] < l`; `results` now contains 'NO'**.

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `q`, `l`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and their conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `results` now includes the string `'NO'`.
