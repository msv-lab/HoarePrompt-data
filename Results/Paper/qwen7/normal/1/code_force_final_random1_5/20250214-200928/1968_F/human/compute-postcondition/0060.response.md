Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted into `v2` to keep the list sorted; `results` now contains 'NO'; it is not the case that `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l`**

Explanation: The code appends 'NO' to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition involving `it1`, `it2`, `v1`, and `v2` remains as stated in the initial state.
