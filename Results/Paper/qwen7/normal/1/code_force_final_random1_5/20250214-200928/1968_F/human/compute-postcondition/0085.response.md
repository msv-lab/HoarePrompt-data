The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the only thing we can infer is that the execution will skip to the next iteration of whatever loop this statement is within. Given the context, it's implied that there is a loop iterating over some data structure like a list or dictionary.

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it merely skips to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `results`, `v1`, `v2`, and `it2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is the integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is updated to the integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` contains 'YES', `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element just before `r` in `v2` using binary search, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
