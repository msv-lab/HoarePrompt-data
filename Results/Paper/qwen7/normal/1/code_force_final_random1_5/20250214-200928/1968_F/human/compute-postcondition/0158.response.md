Output State: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `l` is now an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 4, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, `r` is now an integer from `data[idx + 1]`, `results` is 'YES'**

Explanation: 
- The line `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was previously 'NO' unless certain conditions were met, appending `'YES'` changes its value to `'YES'`.
- No other variables are affected by this line of code, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
