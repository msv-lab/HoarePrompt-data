Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 1`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value from `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary where the key is each unique value of `pf[i]` computed during the loop and the value is a list of all indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals that key, and `i` is `n + 1`.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` remains greater than 0, `idx` has been incremented by `n + 1`, and `n` retains its initial value as an integer from `data[idx - 2]`. The variable `q` also remains as the integer value from `data[idx - 1]`. Both lists `a` and `pf` are of length `n + 1` and filled with zeros. The dictionary `mp` contains keys that are unique values of `pf[i]` (computed during the loop), and for each key, there is a list of all indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals that key. The variable `i` is set to `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
