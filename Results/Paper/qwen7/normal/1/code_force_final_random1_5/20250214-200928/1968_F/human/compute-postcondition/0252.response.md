Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 4`, `l` is `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted (using bisect_left), `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` has 'YES' appended to it.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `q`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
