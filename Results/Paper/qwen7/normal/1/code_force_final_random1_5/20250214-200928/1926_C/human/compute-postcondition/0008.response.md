Output State: **`a` is `a + num % 10`**.

In this case, the initial state does not provide specific values for `a` and `num`. The code updates `a` by adding the last digit of `num` (obtained using `num % 10`) to its current value. Therefore, the updated value of `a` is expressed as `a + num % 10`. The value of `num` remains unchanged, and the initial state of `a` is updated to this new value.
