Output State: **`a` is `a + num % 10`, `num` is `int(num / 10)`**

Explanation: The first line does not affect the current state since `a` is already defined as `a + num % 10`. The second line updates the value of `num` by converting it to an integer after dividing by 10, which truncates the decimal part. The value of `a` remains unchanged as per the initial state.
