Output State: **`a` is equal to `2 * (int(num / 10)) % 10`, `num` is equal to `int(num / 10)`**

Explanation: The code divides `num` by 10 and converts the result to an integer, which truncates the decimal part. This new value is assigned to `num`. The value of `a` is calculated using the updated value of `num`. Since the initial state of `a` was `2 * num % 10`, and `num` is now `int(num / 10)`, `a` is updated to `2 * (int(num / 10)) % 10`. The condition that `num` must be greater than 0 remains valid.
