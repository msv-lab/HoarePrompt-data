Output State: **`a` is equal to `num` modulo 10, `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` to be the remainder when `num` is divided by 10. Since `a` was initially 0, it now takes the value of `num % 10`. The precondition that `num` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5 remains unchanged.
