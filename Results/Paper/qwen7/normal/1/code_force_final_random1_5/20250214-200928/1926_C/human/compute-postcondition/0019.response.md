Output State: **`i` is 200002, `j` is "0", `pd[i]` is 200002**

Explanation: The value of `pd[i]` is incremented by the integer value of `j`. Since `j` is "0", converting it to an integer gives 0. Adding 0 to `pd[i]` which was initially 2 results in `pd[i]` becoming 200002. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
