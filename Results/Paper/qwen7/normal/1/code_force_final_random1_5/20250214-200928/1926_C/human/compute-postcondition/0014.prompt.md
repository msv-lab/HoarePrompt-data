You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        
        num = int(num / 10)
        
    #State: Output State: `a` will be equal to the sum of all digits of the initial value of `num`, and `num` will be reduced to 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to extract the last digit of `num` and add it to `a` until `num` becomes 0. Therefore, after all iterations, `a` contains the sum of all digits of the original `num`, and `num` itself will be 0 since the loop terminates when `num` equals 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the sum of all digits of the initial value of num, and num is reduced to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter num, which is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^5. It returns the sum of all digits of the initial value of num, and reduces num to 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of all digits of the initial value of num, and num is reduced to 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
