Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases (t), where each test case involves an integer (n). It calculates a prefix sum array (pd) of size 400001 and stores cumulative sums along with digit sums for each index. For each test case, it reads an integer (n) and prints the value at index `n` of the precomputed array `pd`. The function ensures that `t` (the number of test cases) is at least 3 and that `n` is within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). If `n` is out of this range, the function does not handle it explicitly in the given code.**
