Output State: **`a` is equal to `2 * num % 10`, `num` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: Initially, `a` is equal to `num % 10`. After executing the line `a = a + num % 10`, `a` is updated to be `num % 10 + num % 10`, which simplifies to `2 * num % 10`. The condition that `num` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
