Output State: `i` is 200002; `j` is "2"; `pd[i]` is 200004.

**Explanation:** The loop iterates over each digit of `i`. Initially, `i` is 200002, and `j` starts as "2". In the first iteration, `j` becomes "0" (the second digit of `i`), and `pd[i]` is updated to 2. In the second iteration, `j` becomes "0" again (the third digit of `i`), and `pd[i]` remains 2. In the third iteration, `j` becomes "0" once more (the fourth digit of `i`), and `pd[i]` remains 2. This process continues until all digits of `i` are processed. Since `i` is 200002, it has 6 digits. After processing all digits, `pd[i]` will be incremented by each digit, resulting in `pd[i]` being 200004.
