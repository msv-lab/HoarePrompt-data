Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is at least 3. If the difference between the second element and the first element of list `l` is less than the difference between the first element and the zeroth element of list `l`, then the third element of list `d1` is set to 1. Otherwise, the third element of list `d1` is set to the difference between the second and first elements of list `l` plus the second element of list `d1`.
