Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0 (though `m` is not used in the code snippet).
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `j` is 1 more than the previous value of `j`, but since `j` is not used in the code snippet, this detail does not affect the output.
- `x` is the first integer input.
- `y` is the second integer input.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

Here, `d2` is a dictionary (or possibly a list indexed like a dictionary), and it contains keys that map to some values. The code is accessing these values with keys `y` and `x` and then subtracting `d2[x]` from `d2[y]`.

Since the actual values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these values.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
