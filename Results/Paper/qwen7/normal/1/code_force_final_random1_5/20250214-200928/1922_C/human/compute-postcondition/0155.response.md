Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `d1[i + 2]` is either `1 + d1[i + 1]` if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` is true, or `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` if the condition is false.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 4.

4. **Condition for the Loop to Continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3 and `n` is greater than 3, the loop will continue as long as `n` remains greater than 4 (since `i` will be 4 in the next iteration).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 4.
   - `n` must remain greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

6. **Postcondition for `d1[i + 2]`**:
   - For `i = 3`, `i + 2` becomes 5.
   - The value of `d1[5]` will depend on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` evaluated at `i = 3`.
   - If the condition is true, `d1[5]` will be `1 + d1[4]`.
   - If the condition is false, `d1[5]` will be `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, and `d1[5]` is either `1 + d1[4]` if `l[4] - l[3] < l[3] - l[2]` is true, or `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]` if the condition is false.**
