Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is set to 1.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `x` and `y` are input integers obtained from the input split by space.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

Here, `d1` is a dictionary, but its contents are not specified in the initial state. Since no specific values for `d1` are given, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `d1[y] - d1[x]`. However, we can describe the expression that will be evaluated.

The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` subtracts the value associated with key `x` in the dictionary `d1` from the value associated with key `y` in the same dictionary.

Therefore, the output will be the result of this subtraction operation.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
