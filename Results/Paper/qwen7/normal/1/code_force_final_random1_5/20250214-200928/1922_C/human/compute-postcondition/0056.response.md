Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - Since `j` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `j` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1 (since it was 0 at the end of the previous iteration).

5. **Conditions for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j < m`.
   - Since `m` remains unchanged within the loop, it still needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

6. **Final States for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `m` must still be greater than 0.
   - `j` will be 1.
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `j` is 1; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer**.
