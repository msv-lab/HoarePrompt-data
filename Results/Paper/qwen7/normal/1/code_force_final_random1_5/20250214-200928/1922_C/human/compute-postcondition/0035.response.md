Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` down to `1` (exclusive), decrementing by `1` each time. The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than `0`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` if the condition is not met.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by `1` each time, the next value of `i` will be `n-3`.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than `0`. Given that `i` is currently `n-2`, the next value `n-3` is still greater than `0` as long as `n > 3`.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be `n-3`.
   - `d2[i]` will depend on the same conditions as before but for `i = n-3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n-3`, `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` if the condition is not met.**
