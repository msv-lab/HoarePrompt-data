Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `i` ranges from `1` to `n - 2` (inclusive). This means that `i` must take values from `1` to `n - 2` during the loop iterations.

3. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - `i`: The loop starts with `i` being `1` and ends when `i` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `1` at the start of the loop.
   - `n`: The loop will run as long as `i < n - 1`. Since `i` starts at `1`, `n` must be greater than `2` for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Other variables**: The other variables (`m`, `x`, `y`, `j`, `d1`, `d2`, `l`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `1`.
- `n` must be greater than `2`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2**.
