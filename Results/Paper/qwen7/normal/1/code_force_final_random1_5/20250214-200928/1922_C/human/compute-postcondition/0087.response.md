Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2
- Postcondition: If `l[3] - l[2] < l[2] - l[1]`, then `d1[4]` is 2. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i in range(1, n - 1)`. This means `i` should be incremented by 1 and checked against `n - 1` in the next iteration.
3. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3.
5. **Condition Check**: The loop will continue if `i` is still within the range `1 < i < n - 1`. Since `i` becomes 3, it will continue as long as `n > 4`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` will be incremented to 3.
- `n` must remain greater than 4 to ensure the loop continues.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4**
