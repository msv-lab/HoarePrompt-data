Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `l` by mapping each element of the input string (split by spaces) to an integer. The original values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The new variable `l` contains the integer values from the input string.
