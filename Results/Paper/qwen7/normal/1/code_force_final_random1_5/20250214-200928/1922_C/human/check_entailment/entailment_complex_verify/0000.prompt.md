You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

If `y` is greater than `x` during any iteration, the difference `d1[y] - d1[x]` is printed; otherwise, the difference `d2[y] - d2[x]` is printed. The values of `m` and `j` do not change regardless of the conditions inside the loop. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` will store the cumulative differences as described in the loop body, and these values will be used to compute the outputs for each query provided in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, an integer \( m \), and a series of pairs \( (x_i, y_i) \). It then calculates and prints the difference between certain values stored in two dictionaries, \( d1 \) and \( d2 \), based on the positions \( x_i \) and \( y_i \) in the list \( a \). The dictionaries \( d1 \) and \( d2 \) store cumulative differences derived from the list \( a \). The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Specifically, the logic used to determine the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities is flawed. 

The program attempts to precompute the minimum number of coins required to reach each city from its closest city using two dictionaries `d1` and `d2`. However, this approach does not correctly handle the scenario where the closest city might not be the optimal choice for minimizing the cost. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

This seems correct at first glance, but let's analyze the query `1 5` more closely. According to the problem description, the closest city to city 1 is city 2, and the closest city to city 5 is city 4. The program calculates the cost as follows:
- From city 1 to city 2: 1 coin
- From city 2 to city 3: 4 coins
- From city 3 to city 4: 3 coins
- From city 4 to city 5: 5 coins

Total: 1 + 4 + 3 + 5 = 13 coins

However, the correct minimum cost should be calculated by directly traveling from city 1 to city 5, which is |20 - 0| = 20 coins. The program incorrectly uses the precomputed values without considering the direct travel cost.

Thus, the program fails to correctly compute the minimum number of coins for certain queries, making it incorrect.
