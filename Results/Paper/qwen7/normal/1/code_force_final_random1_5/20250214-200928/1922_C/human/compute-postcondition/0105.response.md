Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, the length of list `l` is at least `n-1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to be `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Here, `i` is initially `n-3`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state includes the updated value of `d2[i]` and retains the initial conditions for `n` and the length of list `l`.
