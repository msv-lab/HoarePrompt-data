Output State: **`i` is `n-4`; `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates `d2[i]` to be `1 + d2[i + 1]`. The value of `i` remains `n-4` as no operation was performed on it. The condition used to determine the value of `d2[i]` is not relevant here since the assignment is direct and does not depend on the comparison. Therefore, the updated state of `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`.
