Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the step value `-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value and Range of `i`:**
   - The initial value of `i` is given as `n-1`.
   - The loop runs from `n-2` to `0` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`.

3. **Adjust the State Based on the Loop Conditions:**
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be within the specified range. Since the loop starts at `n-2` and ends just before `0`, `i` must be at least `n-2` and less than `0` at the end of the loop.
   - Given that `i` starts at `n-1`, the loop will run until `i` becomes `n-2`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if `n-2` is greater than or equal to `0`. This means `n` must be at least 2.

5. **Consider the Other Variables:**
   - `n` must remain greater than `m+1` as stated in the initial state.
   - `d1[n]` is determined based on the conditions inside the loop, but since we are adjusting the state before the loop, we don't need to change this.
   - `d2[n-1]` is given as `1`, and this value will be used in the loop.

Based on the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `m+1`, `d2[n-1]` is 1.**

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `m+1`, `d2[n-1]` is 1**
