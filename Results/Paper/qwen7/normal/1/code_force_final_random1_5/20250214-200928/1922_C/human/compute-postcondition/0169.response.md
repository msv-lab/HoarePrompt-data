Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `m+1`, `d2[n-1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is `n-2`, and the other conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `d2[i]` is calculated using the provided formula. All other variables and their constraints remain as they were initially.
