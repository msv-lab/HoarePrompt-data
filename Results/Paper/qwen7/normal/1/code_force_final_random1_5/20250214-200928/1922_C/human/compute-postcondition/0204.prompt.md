Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `m` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m+1`, `d2[n-1]` is 1, and for each `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `d2[i]` is determined based on the condition inside the loop. Specifically, if `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]` (with the understanding that `l[i-1]` is valid for `i > 0`), then `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is set to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if y > x:
        print(d1[y] - d1[x])
    else:
        print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0, `m` is a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. If `y` is greater than `x`, no changes are made to `y`. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, no changes are made to `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`j` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are input integers. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged regardless of the condition in the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. The values of `j`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition `y > x` is true or false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
