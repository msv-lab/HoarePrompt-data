Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `i` will be 0, `d1` will contain the updated values based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, and `d2[0]` will be the final value calculated according to the given rules.**

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `m`. The values of `i`, `d1`, and `d2` remain unchanged from their initial state.
