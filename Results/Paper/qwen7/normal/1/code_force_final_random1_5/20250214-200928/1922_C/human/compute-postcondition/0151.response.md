Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `d1[i + 2]` is 1 + `d1[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code `d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]` updates the dictionary `d1`. Given that `i` is 3, `i + 2` equals 5. So, `d1[5]` is set to `1 + d1[4]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
