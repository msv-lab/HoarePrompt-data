Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d1[i + 2]` to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. Given that initially `i` is 1, after executing the line of code, `i` becomes 2. The condition `n > 2` remains unchanged. The value of `d1[i + 2]` is now dependent on the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` plus the previous value of `d1[i + 1]`. The other conditions and variables remain as they were in the initial state.
