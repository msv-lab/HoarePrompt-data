Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` decreases by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-3`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `m+1`
   - `d2[n-1]` is 1
   - `d2[i]` is either `2 + d2[i + 1]` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` otherwise.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `n-4`.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than 0. Given that `i` is currently `n-3` and the loop starts from `n-2`, the next value of `i` is `n-4`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n-4` must still be greater than 0, which implies `n` must be greater than 4.

6. **Adjust the other states**:
   - `d2[n-1]` remains 1 because it is an index that does not change within the loop.
   - `d2[i]` will depend on the values of `l[i]`, `l[i-1]`, and `l[i+1]`, but since these values are not specified to change, we assume they remain the same for the purpose of this adjustment.

7. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is now `n-4`
   - `n` must be greater than 4 (since `n-4 > 0` implies `n > 4`)
   - `d2[n-1]` is 1
   - `d2[i]` will be determined based on the conditions given, but we do not need to specify its exact value here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n-4`, `n` must be greater than 4, `d2[n-1]` is 1**
