Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, n - 1)`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-2`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition tells us that `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Check the New Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i + 1` must still be less than `n`. Given that `i` was at least 1 and less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, `i + 1` will be at least 2 and less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to update the state such that `i` is now `i + 1` and ensure that `i + 1` is still less than `n`.

Given these steps, we can conclude the following:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- To ensure the loop continues, `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2 (since `i` was 1 and incremented by 1), `n` must be greater than 2**.
