Given the initial state:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `x` is updated to the first integer from the input.
- `y` is updated to the second integer from the input.

We need to determine the value of `d2[y] - d2[x]` and then print it.

However, the initial state does not provide any information about the dictionary `d2`. Since `d2` is not defined or initialized with any specific values in the given information, we cannot determine the exact values of `d2[x]` and `d2[y]`.

Therefore, the output will depend on the actual values of `d2[x]` and `d2[y]` at runtime.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
