Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. If `y` is greater than `x`, the postcondition remains as the initial state where `m` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer greater than `x`. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, the postcondition remains as the initial state where `m` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer less than or equal to `x`.
