Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `m` is a positive integer, but its value is not specified.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

Here, `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is a dictionary. Since the values of `x` and `y` are input integers, we cannot determine the exact values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` without knowing the contents of the dictionary `d1`.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
