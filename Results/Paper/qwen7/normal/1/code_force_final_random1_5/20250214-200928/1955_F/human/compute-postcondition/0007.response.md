Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `p` is a list of integers where each element is the nearest even number to the corresponding input integer**

Explanation: The code takes a space-separated string of integers as input, splits it into a list, and then uses a lambda function to convert each integer to the nearest even number. This is done using the expression `int(x) - int(x) % 2`, which effectively rounds down to the nearest even number. The original value of `t` remains unchanged, and the list `p` is updated to contain the nearest even numbers to the input integers. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range and `p` contains the nearest even numbers to the input integers is maintained.
