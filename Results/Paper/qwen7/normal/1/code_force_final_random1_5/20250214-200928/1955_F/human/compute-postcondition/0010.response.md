Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `p_i` is a list of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively, such that 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200. The function returns the total count of elements in the initial sequence for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a specified number of elements (ranging from 1 to 10,000) and a list of counts for four different types of elements (1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s). The function calculates and returns the total count of all elements in the initial sequence for each test case.
