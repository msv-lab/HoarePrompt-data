Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `p` is a list of integers where each element is the nearest even number to the corresponding input integer, the input is split and each element is converted to an integer and then adjusted to the nearest even number.**

Explanation: The code takes a string input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then uses a lambda function to adjust each integer to the nearest even number. The original value of `t` remains unchanged, and `p` is updated to contain the nearest even numbers to the input integers.
