You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i is a list of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively, such that 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `p` is a list of integers where each element is the nearest even number to the corresponding input integer, and the loop has executed for all provided test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) and a list \( p \) containing four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of half the total count of elements in the initial sequence plus one if exactly three of the first three elements in \( p \) are odd, otherwise zero. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program creates a list `p` from the input.
   - It then modifies each element of `p` using a lambda function: `int(x) - int(x) % 2`. This operation essentially rounds down each count to the nearest even number. For example, if `p_i` is odd, it becomes the largest even number less than or equal to `p_i`.

3. **Winning Condition Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum of elements in `p` that are odd (i.e., `x % 2 > 0`).
   - If the sum of odd elements in `p[:3]` (i.e., the first three elements) is exactly 3, it prints 1.
   - Otherwise, it prints the integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Rounding Down to Nearest Even Number:**
   - The operation `int(x) - int(x) % 2` correctly rounds down each count to the nearest even number. This part is correct.

2. **Sum of Odd Elements:**
   - The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the sum of the first three elements being odd is exactly 3. This logic is correct for determining if Bob wins immediately after the first removal.

3. **Integer Division by 2:**
   - The statement `sum(p) // 2` calculates the integer division of the total sum of elements in `p` by 2. This is used to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if the immediate condition for Bob to win is not met.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1:** `1 1 1 0`
  - After rounding down, `p` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.
  - The sum of the first three elements is `0`, which is not 3. So, we calculate `sum(p) // 2 = 0 // 2 = 0`. But since the problem states that Bob wins if the immediate condition is not met, the output should be `1` (as per the example).

- **Example 2:** `1 0 1 2`
  - After rounding down, `p` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 2]`.
  - The sum of the first three elements is `0`, which is not 3. So, we calculate `sum(p) // 2 = 2 // 2 = 1`. The output is `1`.

- **Example 3:** `2 2 2 0`
  - After rounding down, `p` becomes `[2, 2, 2, 0]`.
  - The sum of the first three elements is `6`, which is not 3. So, we calculate `sum(p) // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3`. The output is `3`.

- **Example 4:** `3 3 2 0`
  - After rounding down, `p` becomes `[2, 2, 2, 0]`.
  - The sum of the first three elements is `6`, which is not 3. So, we calculate `sum(p) // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3`. The output is `3`.

- **Example 5:** `0 9 9 9`
  - After rounding down, `p` becomes `[0, 8, 8, 8]`.
  - The sum of the first three elements is `0`, which is not 3. So, we calculate `sum(p) // 2 = 24 // 2 = 12`. The output is `12`.

### Conclusion:

The program logic does not fully match the problem statement. Specifically, the condition for Bob to win should consider the parity of the entire sequence, not just the first three elements. The current implementation does not correctly handle the problem's requirements.
