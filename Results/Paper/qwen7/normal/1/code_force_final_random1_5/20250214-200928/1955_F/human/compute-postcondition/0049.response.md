Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by counts of four types of elements (1, 2, 3, and 4). For each test case, it calculates the sum of the floor division of each element by 2 and increments a counter based on specific conditions. If the first three elements of the input list are equal and odd, it adds one to the counter. Finally, it prints the total count calculated.**
