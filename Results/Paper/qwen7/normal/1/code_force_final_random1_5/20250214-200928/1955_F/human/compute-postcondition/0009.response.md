Output State: **t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `p` is a list of integers where each element is the nearest even number to the corresponding input integer, and the loop has executed for all provided test cases.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed for all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The list `p` contains integers where each element is the nearest even number to the corresponding input integer from each test case. The loop processes each test case individually, adjusting the elements of `p` as specified and then performing the given operations (checking conditions and printing results) for every test case until there are no more test cases left to process.
