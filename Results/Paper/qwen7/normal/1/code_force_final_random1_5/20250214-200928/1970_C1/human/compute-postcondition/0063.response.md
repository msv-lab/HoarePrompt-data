Output State: **`current` is a node that has at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `current`, `visited` now includes `neighbor`, and `queue` now contains `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1) is appended to queue`.**

This means that the `queue` has been updated by appending the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to its existing contents. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
