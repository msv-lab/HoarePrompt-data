The function processes a graph represented as an adjacency list and determines whether a specific path exists based on the parity of traversing both the original and reversed graph. It reads the graph structure from standard input, then checks if the path from the starting node (determined by the first input) alternates between even and odd steps when traversed in both forward and reverse directions. If the path alternates correctly in both directions, it prints "Hermione"; otherwise, it prints "Ron".
