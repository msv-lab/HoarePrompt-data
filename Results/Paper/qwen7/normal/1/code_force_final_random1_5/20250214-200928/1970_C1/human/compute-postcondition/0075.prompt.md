You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and target is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. Both start and target are within the range 1 <= start, target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The variable tree is an adjacency list representation of the tree, where tree[i] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of node i.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: All nodes in the tree have been visited, and the `queue` is empty. The `visited` set contains every node in the tree, and the `dist` dictionary holds the shortest distance from the `start` node to every node.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`. `start` is an integer representing the starting node, and `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. The function returns the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. If no path exists, it returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the distance `dist` which is the integer from the second element of the deque before popping.

Case_2: The program returns the distance of the node `current` from the `start` node, which is represented by the variable `dist`.

Case_3: The program returns the shortest distance from the start node to the target node, which is stored in the variable `dist`.

Case_4: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
