Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `x` is 0, `one` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `one` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `z`, `tmp`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions for `a` and `b` within the loop context and the lists `rev[b]` and `lst[a]` also remain unaffected.
