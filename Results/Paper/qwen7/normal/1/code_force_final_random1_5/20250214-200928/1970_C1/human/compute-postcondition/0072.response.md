Output State: **All nodes in the tree have been visited, and the `queue` is empty. The `visited` set contains every node in the tree, and the `dist` dictionary holds the shortest distance from the `start` node to every node.**

In this final output state, the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm has completely traversed the entire tree. The `queue` is empty because there are no more nodes left to process. The `visited` set includes every single node in the tree, confirming that the BFS has visited all nodes. Additionally, the `dist` dictionary contains the shortest distance from the `start` node to each node in the tree, providing the full shortest path information for the entire graph.
