Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(x - 1):`. The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the state directly. The key variables here are `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `x - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `x` must be greater than 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `x` is now greater than 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `rev[b]` is the list `[a, a]`.
   - `lst[a]` is now `[b]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `x > 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be greater than 1.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `rev[b]`, and `lst[a]` do not change within the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `x` is now greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is now greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` is the list `[a, a]`, `lst[a]` is now `[b]`**
