Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `rev[b]` now contains the list `[a]`.**

Explanation: The code `rev[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `rev[b]`. Since `b` is an integer from the input, and `rev` is a list of lists (where each index corresponds to a list), this operation adds `a` to the list at index `b` in `rev`. Initially, `lst[a]` contained the original elements plus `b`, but this does not affect the value of `rev[b]`. Therefore, after the code execution, `rev[b]` contains the list `[a]`.
