Output State: **`visited` contains the `neighbor`; `queue` contains an element `(neighbor, dist + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` now includes this new tuple, while the `visited` list remains unchanged and still contains the `neighbor`.
