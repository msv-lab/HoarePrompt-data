Output State: **`x` is now greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` is the list `[a, a]`, `lst[a]` is now `[b, b], a` is updated to the first integer input, `b` is updated to the second integer input**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b` to the list `lst[a]`. Initially, `lst[a]` is `[b]`. After appending `b`, `lst[a]` becomes `[b, b]`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their inputs. The other variables (`x`, `rev[b]`) retain their initial states.
