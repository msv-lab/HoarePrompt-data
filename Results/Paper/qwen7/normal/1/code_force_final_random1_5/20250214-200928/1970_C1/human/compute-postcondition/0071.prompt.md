Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The program returns the shortest distance from the start node to the target node, which is stored in the variable `dist`, if `current` is equal to `target`. If `current` is not equal to `target`, the function does not return anything.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `current`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `visited` now includes `neighbor`, `queue` now contains `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. Since there is no else part, these changes only occur when the condition `neighbor not in visited` is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `current`, `visited` now includes `neighbor`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not already in `visited`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `neighbor` is not in `visited`, and either `neighbor` is added to `visited` and `queue` contains an element `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, or nothing changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
