To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while rev[tmp] != []:
```
This means the loop will continue as long as the list `rev[tmp]` is not empty.

### Current State
- `z` is an input integer (its value remains unchanged).
- `tmp` is equal to `rev[z].pop()` (this means `tmp` is the last element popped from the list `rev[z]`).
- `x` is 0 (unchanged).
- `one` is False (unchanged).
- `two` is False (unchanged).

### Determining the Next State
For the loop to execute one more time, the list `rev[tmp]` must not be empty. Since `tmp` is derived from `z` and `tmp` is used to access `rev[tmp]`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is related to the list `rev[tmp]`.

### Adjusted State
We need to ensure that `rev[tmp]` is not empty for the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `rev[tmp]` should not be empty.

### Final Answer
State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `rev[z].pop()`, `x` is 0, `one` is False, `two` is False, `rev[tmp]` must not be empty**
