Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `lst[tmp] != []`. This means the loop continues as long as the list `lst[tmp]` is not empty.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `z` is an input integer.
   - `tmp` is now the last element of `lst[z]`.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `one` is False.
   - `lst[z]` is not an empty list.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends on `lst[tmp]`. For the loop to continue, `lst[tmp]` must not be an empty list.
   - Since `lst[z]` is not empty at the end of the previous iteration, `tmp` was pointing to a valid index within `lst[z]`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `lst[tmp]` must still not be an empty list.
   - The values of `z`, `x`, and `one` do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `lst[tmp]` must not be an empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is now the last element of `lst[z]`, `x` is 0, `one` is False, and `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list**
