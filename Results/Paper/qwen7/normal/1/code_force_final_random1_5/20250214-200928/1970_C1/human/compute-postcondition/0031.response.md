Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `x` is 0, `one` is False, `two` is True**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `z` to `tmp`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `tmp` now holds the value of `z`, while `z`, `x`, `one`, and `two` retain their original values.
