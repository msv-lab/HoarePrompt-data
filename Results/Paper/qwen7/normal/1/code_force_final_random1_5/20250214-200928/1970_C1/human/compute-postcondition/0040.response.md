Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `rev[rev[z].pop().pop()`.pop()`, `x` is 0, `one` is False, `two` is False, and `tmp` is now equal to `rev[tmp].pop()`**.

Explanation: The code `tmp = rev[tmp].pop()` pops and assigns the last element from the list `rev[tmp]` to `tmp`. The other variables (`z`, `x`, `one`, `two`) remain unchanged. The initial state of `tmp` was defined as `rev[rev[z].pop()].pop()`, which remains true before and after the operation.
