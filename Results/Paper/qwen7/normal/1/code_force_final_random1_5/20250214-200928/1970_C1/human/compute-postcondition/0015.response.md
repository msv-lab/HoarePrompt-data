Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `x` will be 0, `a` and `b` will no longer be defined within the loop context, `rev[b]` will contain a list of all integers `a` such that there is an edge from `a` to `b` in the graph, and `lst[a]` will contain a list of all integers `b` such that there is an edge from `a` to `b` in the graph.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `x` will have been decremented to 0 because the loop runs `x-1` times. The variables `a` and `b` will no longer hold any specific values since they are reassigned in each iteration. The `rev` dictionary will have keys as nodes and values as lists of nodes that point to the key node, and the `lst` dictionary will have keys as nodes and values as lists of nodes pointing to the key node.
