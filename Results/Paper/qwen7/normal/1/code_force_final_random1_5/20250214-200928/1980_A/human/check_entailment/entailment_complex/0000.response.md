Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples containing `n`, `m`, and a string `a`).

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The function iterates over each test case, extracting `n`, `m`, and `a` from the `test_cases` list.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: It initializes a list `freq` of size 7 (corresponding to the difficulty levels 'A' to 'G') and increments the appropriate index based on the character in the string `a`.

4. **Calculate Missing Problems**: For each difficulty level, it calculates the difference between `m` and the frequency (`f`) of that difficulty level. If this difference is greater than 0, it means additional problems are needed for that difficulty level. These differences are summed up to get the total number of missing problems.

5. **Store Results**: The calculated missing number of problems for each test case is appended to the `results` list.

6. **Return Results**: After processing all test cases, the function returns the `results` list.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and matches the expected behavior. Therefore, the function should produce the correct output for the given input examples.

Correctness: **True**
