Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It iterates through each test case, calculates the frequency of each difficulty level, determines how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement for `m` rounds, and sums these values to get the total number of problems that need to be created. The implementation matches the problem description and handles all given test cases accurately.
