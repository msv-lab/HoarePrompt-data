Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the value of `missing` for each iteration of the loop; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain exactly `t` tuples; `_` ranges from 0 to `t-1` inclusive; for each tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a string, `freq` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency count of characters 'A' through 'G' in the string `a`, and `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each element in `freq`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `results` will be a list of `t` elements, where each element corresponds to the `missing` value calculated for each test case in `test_cases`. Each test case consists of `n`, `m`, and a string `a`, and `missing` is computed based on these inputs as described in the loop body.
    return results
    #`results` is a list containing the missing values calculated for each test case in `test_cases`, where each missing value is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each element in `freq` for the corresponding test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns a list of missing values for each test case. For each test case, it computes the missing number of problems Vlad needs to create based on the given parameters `n`, `m`, and the string `a`. Specifically, it counts the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`, then determines how many more problems are needed to meet the requirement `m` for each difficulty level. The result is a list of these missing values for all test cases.
