Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, each tuple contains two integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `_` is now 0, `n` is an integer from the first tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is an integer from the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is a string from the first tuple in `test_cases`, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for prob in a:
    freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, each tuple contains two integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `_` is now 0, `n` is an integer from the first tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is an integer from the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is a string from the first tuple in `test_cases`, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by 1, `prob` is a character from the string `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, each tuple contains two integers \(n\) and \(m\) such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 5\), and a string `a` of length \(n\) consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `_` is now 0, `n` is an integer from the first tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is an integer from the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is a string from the first tuple in `test_cases`, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by 1, `prob` is the next character in the string `a`, `freq` is updated by incrementing the count of the character `prob` in the string `a` by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer from the first tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is an integer from the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is a string from the first tuple in `test_cases`, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by 1, `prob` is the next character in the string `a`, and the frequency count for the character `prob` in the string `a` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
