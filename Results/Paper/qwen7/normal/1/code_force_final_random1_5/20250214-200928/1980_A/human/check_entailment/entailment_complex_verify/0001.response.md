### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Definition and Function Design**:
   - The program correctly defines the number of test cases (`t`) and the test cases themselves (`test_cases`). This is accurate and aligns with the problem description.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is appropriate for the problem statement. This is also accurate.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using a list `freq`. This is done correctly by iterating over the string `a` and updating the frequency count for each character. This part is accurate.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**:
   - The function determines how many problems are missing for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds. This is done by computing `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f` and summing these values. This calculation ensures that only the missing problems are counted, which is correct.

4. **Result Compilation**:
   - The function sums up the missing problems across all difficulty levels and appends this value to the `results` list. This step is correctly implemented and ensures that the final result is a list of missing values for each test case.

5. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns the list of results for each test case, which is the expected output format. This is correct.

6. **Handling Examples**:
   - The annotated code and the provided examples show that the function handles the examples correctly. The output matches the expected results, indicating that the implementation is correct.

Given that the code follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles the examples provided correctly, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
