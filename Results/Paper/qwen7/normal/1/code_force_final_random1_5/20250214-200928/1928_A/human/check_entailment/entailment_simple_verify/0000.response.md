### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code against the problem description and the given examples.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Bob needs to determine if he can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them.
- If two rectangles differ only by a 90Â° rotation, they are considered the same.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Annotations:
- The program iterates over the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
- It checks several conditions to decide if another rectangle can be formed.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Case 1: Both Dimensions Even**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, the program prints 'yes'.
   - This is correct because both dimensions can be halved, and the resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

2. **Case 2: One Dimension is 1**
   - The program incorrectly prints 'no' when one dimension is 1.
   - For example, a 2x1 rectangle can be split into two 1x1 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x2 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original but rotated.
   - The current logic does not handle this correctly.

3. **Case 3: Difference Between Dimensions is Odd**
   - The program incorrectly prints 'yes' when the difference between dimensions is odd.
   - For example, a 3x2 rectangle can be split into two 3x1 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original.
   - The current logic does not handle this correctly either.

4. **Example where the program fails:**
   - Input: `1 2`
   - Expected Output: `Yes`
   - Actual Output: `No`

   The program fails to recognize that a 1x2 rectangle can be split into two 1x1 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 2x1 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original but rotated.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where one dimension is 1 and the difference between dimensions is odd.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
