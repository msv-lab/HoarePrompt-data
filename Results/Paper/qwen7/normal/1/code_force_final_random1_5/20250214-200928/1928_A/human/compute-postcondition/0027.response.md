Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is the new input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first input integer from the split, `b` is the second input integer from the split**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The original values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged. `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the first and second integers from the split input, respectively.
