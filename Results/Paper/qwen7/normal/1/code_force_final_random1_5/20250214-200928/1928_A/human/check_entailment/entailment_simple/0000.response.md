### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided function step-by-step:

1. **Loop through Test Cases**: The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Input Handling**: For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
3. **Conditions to Check**:
   - **Case 1**: If both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0`), the function prints 'yes'. This is correct because an even-sized rectangle can always be divided into smaller rectangles and recombined into a different shape.
   - **Case 2**: If the difference between `a` and `b` is exactly equal to the other dimension (i.e., `a - b == -b` or `b - a == -a`), the function prints 'no'. This is also correct because if the dimensions are such that one is exactly double the other, no other distinct rectangle can be formed.
   - **Case 3**: If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd (`(a - b) % 2 != 0`), the function prints 'yes'. This is incorrect because if the difference is odd, it does not necessarily mean a different rectangle can be formed. For example, a 3x5 rectangle can be cut into 3x2 and 3x3, but the 3x3 part cannot be combined with the 3x2 part to form a different rectangle.
   - **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, the function prints 'no'. This is also incorrect because there might be other ways to form a different rectangle when the difference is even.

### Correct Logic:
- A rectangle can be divided into smaller rectangles and recombined into a different shape if at least one of the dimensions is even.
- If both dimensions are odd, no new distinct rectangle can be formed.
- If one dimension is even and the other is odd, a new distinct rectangle can often be formed.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code has logical errors in its conditions. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
