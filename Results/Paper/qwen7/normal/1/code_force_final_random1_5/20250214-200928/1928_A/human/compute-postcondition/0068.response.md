Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0 - 1, which simplifies to `t > -1`. Since `t` is greater than -1, it means `t` can be any positive number or zero.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input, and they are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Output: **'No'**
