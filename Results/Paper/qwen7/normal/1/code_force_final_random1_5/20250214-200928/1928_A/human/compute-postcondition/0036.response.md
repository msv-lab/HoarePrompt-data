Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it takes two positive integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, and returns a value based on the relationship between a and b.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` (the number of pairs of integers `a` and `b`), and for each pair `(a, b)`, it returns a value based on the comparison between `a` and `b`. However, the specific return value based on the comparison is not detailed in the given information.
