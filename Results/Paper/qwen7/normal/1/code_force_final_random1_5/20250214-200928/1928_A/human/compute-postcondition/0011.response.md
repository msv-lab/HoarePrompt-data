Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is odd.
- Neither \(a - b = -a\) nor \(b - a = -b\).
- \((a - b) \% 2 == 0\).

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'`.

Output: **'no'**
