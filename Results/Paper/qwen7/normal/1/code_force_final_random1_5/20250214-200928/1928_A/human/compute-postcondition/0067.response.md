Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input.
- `a1` equals `a2`, both being `a/2`.
- `b1` equals `b2`, both being `b//2`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Since no other variables are involved in the `print` statement and the string `'No'` is explicitly provided, the output will be:

Output: **'No'**
