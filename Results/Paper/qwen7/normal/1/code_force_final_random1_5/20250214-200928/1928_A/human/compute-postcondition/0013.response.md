Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd. If `a - b = -a` with `a` being the value after the operation, or `b - a = -b` with `b` being the value after the operation, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the difference between `a` and `b` is not zero and is odd, the condition remains unchanged. If the difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition remains unchanged as well.
