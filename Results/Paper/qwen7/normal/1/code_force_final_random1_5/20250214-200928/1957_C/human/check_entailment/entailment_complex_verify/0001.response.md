### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the original assessment to verify its correctness.

#### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization:**
   - The `dp` array is initialized with -1, indicating uncomputed values.
   - The `func_1` function sets base cases for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`.
   - For larger values of `i`, the recurrence relation is used:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]

2. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program reads \(n\) and \(k\).
   - It then reads \(k\) pairs of coordinates, adding them to a set `invalid` to keep track of occupied rows and columns.
   - The final number of configurations is calculated as `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`.

3. **Recurrence Relation Explanation:**
   - The recurrence relation seems to count the number of ways to place rooks on an \(i \times i\) board without attacking each other.
   - The term `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` accounts for placing a rook in a new row or column while ensuring no attacks.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The base cases handle small boards (1x1 and 2x2).
   - The `max(1, ...)` ensures that even if no valid configurations remain, the result is at least 1.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[1] = 1`: This is correct because there is only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: This is also correct because there are three ways to place two non-attacking rooks on a 2x2 board (one in the top-left and bottom-right, one in the top-right and bottom-left, and one in the center).

2. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is intended to count the number of ways to place rooks on an \(i \times i\) board.
   - However, the recurrence relation does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem. Specifically, it does not ensure that no two rooks are placed in the same row or column after accounting for the already placed rooks.

3. **Handling Invalid Moves:**
   - The program correctly tracks the invalid rows and columns using the `invalid` set.
   - The final number of configurations is calculated as `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`, which is a good approach to ensure that the result is at least 1.

4. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The `func_1` function populates the `dp` array correctly for the base cases and larger values.
   - However, the recurrence relation does not correctly reflect the constraints of the problem. The recurrence relation assumes that all previous configurations are valid, which is not necessarily true after accounting for the already placed rooks.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct. While the program correctly handles the dynamic programming aspect and the edge cases, the recurrence relation does not accurately model the constraints of the problem. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct number of configurations for larger boards.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
