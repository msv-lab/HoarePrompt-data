Output State: **`dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 2 * (4 - 1) * dp[2]) % 1000000007`, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**.

Explanation: The code updates `dp[i]` to the value of `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Given that `i` was initially 4, after executing the code, `i` is now 5. The value of `dp[4]` is calculated using the formula provided, with `i` being 4. The initial conditions and constraints on `n` remain unchanged.
