Output State: The final state of `dp` will be a list where each element `dp[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` for all `i` from 3 to `n`. After executing all iterations of the loop, the value of `i` will be `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to the maximum index in the `dp` array, which is `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `dp` array will contain values calculated according to the given formula for each index from 3 to `n`, with all other variables remaining in their initial or updated states as described.
