Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `dp[3]` is \((dp[2] + 2 \times (3 - 1) \times dp[1]) \% 1000000007\)
- `i` is 3

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop starts from `i = 3` and increments `i` until `i` reaches `n + 1`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = 4`.

### Adjusting the States

- **Variable `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will be 4 in the next iteration.
- **Array `dp`**: The value of `dp[3]` is already computed and does not change within the loop body (since the loop body is omitted). Therefore, `dp[3]` remains the same.
- **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` is not mentioned to change, so it remains as it was before the loop started.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration

- `dp[3]` remains the same as computed in the previous iteration.
- `i` is now 4.
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`dp[3]` is \((dp[2] + 2 \times (3 - 1) \times dp[1]) \% 1000000007\), `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
