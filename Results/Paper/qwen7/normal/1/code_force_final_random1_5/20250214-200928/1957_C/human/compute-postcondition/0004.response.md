Output State: **`dp[3]` is (dp[2] + 2 * (3 - 1) * dp[1]) % 1000000007, `i` is 3**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` for `i` being 3. Since `i` is 3, the equation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` becomes `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * (3 - 1) * dp[1]) % 1000000007`. The initial state of `i` being 3 remains unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be at least 3 is still valid, but since no specific values for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are given, they remain as they were before the calculation.
