Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a new input string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `i` is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is an integer input from the user and must be at least 3.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- Either the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i+1` in `b` are both less than ('<') or the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i-1` in `b` are both less than ('<').

The print statement is simply `print('No')`.

Given this, the print statement will output the string "No" regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `n`, or `t`.

Output: **No**
