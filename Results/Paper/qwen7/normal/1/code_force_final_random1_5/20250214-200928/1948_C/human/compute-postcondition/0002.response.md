Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which means they retain their unspecified values from the initial state. The only change is that `n` now holds the integer value of the user's input.
