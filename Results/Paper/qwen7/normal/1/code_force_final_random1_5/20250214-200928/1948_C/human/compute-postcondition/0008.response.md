Output State: **`a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the initial conditions and variables are not altered by the `break` statement itself, the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the program will exit the current loop or conditional block it is inside.
