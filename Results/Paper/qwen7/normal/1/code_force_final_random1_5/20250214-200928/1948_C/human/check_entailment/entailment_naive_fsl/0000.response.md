Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has a logical flaw. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly handle all cases where the robot can or cannot reach the cell (2, n). Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
4
<>><
><>>
```

- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It moves right to (1, 2) because the arrow in (1, 1) points right.
- From (1, 2), it moves left to (1, 1) because the arrow in (1, 2) points left.
- From (1, 1), it moves right to (1, 2) again.
- From (1, 2), it moves right to (1, 3).
- From (1, 3), it moves right to (1, 4).
- From (1, 4), it moves down to (2, 4).

However, the `func_1` function incorrectly returns 'No' for this case. This is because the function only checks certain conditions without considering the full path the robot can take. The function should simulate the entire path the robot takes, not just check specific conditions.

To fix this, the function needs to simulate the robot's movement step-by-step and check if it can reach (2, n). The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
