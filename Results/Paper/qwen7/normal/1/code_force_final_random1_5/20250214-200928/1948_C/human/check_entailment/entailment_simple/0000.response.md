Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function checks if the robot can move from the starting position (1,1) to the target position (2,n).
   - It iterates through the middle of the grid (i.e., indices from 1 to n-1 in steps of 2) and checks if the robot can move downwards at each step.
   - If it finds a situation where the robot cannot move downwards due to the arrows in the current and adjacent cells, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - If no such situation is found, it checks the final positions of the robot in both rows and determines if the robot can reach the target (2,n).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid and the arrows in both rows.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies if the robot can move downwards at each step and checks the final positions.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.
   - Given the constraints and the problem statement, the provided code seems to handle all cases as expected.

Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is True.

Correctness: **True**
