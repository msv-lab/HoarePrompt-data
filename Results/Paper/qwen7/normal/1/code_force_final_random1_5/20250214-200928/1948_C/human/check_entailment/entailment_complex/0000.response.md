Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the arrows in the grid.
   - It iterates over the first half of the grid (up to `n//2 - 1`), checking if the robot can get stuck due to certain configurations of arrows.
   - Specifically, it checks if the robot can get trapped by arrows pointing left in `row1` and `row2` in a way that prevents it from reaching the end.
   - If any such configuration is found, it returns 'No'.
   - If no such configuration is found, it proceeds to check the last column and returns 'Yes' if the robot can reach the end.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the input format and constraints.
   - It processes each test case appropriately and uses `func_1` to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and covers the necessary conditions to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
