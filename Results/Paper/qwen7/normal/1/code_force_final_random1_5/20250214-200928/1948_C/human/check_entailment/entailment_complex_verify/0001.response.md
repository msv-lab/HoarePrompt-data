### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaws in the given program. Let's break down the issues and verify the original assessment:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check specific conditions to determine if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)`. However, it only checks certain conditions and does not fully account for all possible paths the robot can take.
   - Specifically, the function only checks the middle part of the grid (`2 * i + 1` and `2 * i` indices) and returns 'No' without considering other possible valid paths. This is overly restrictive and does not cover all scenarios.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - While the output formatting is correct, the correctness of the output depends on the correctness of `func_1`.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`

- **Logic Flaws**:
  - The function assumes that if an arrow points left at an odd index, the robot cannot reach the end, which is overly restrictive and does not cover all possible valid paths.
  - It does not consider the possibility of the robot moving up and down between rows, which is necessary to fully simulate the robot's movement.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the movement of the robot through the grid while respecting the directions of the arrows. We should check if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)` by simulating its path.

### Corrected Program

The original assessment suggests a corrected approach, which involves simulating the robot's movement through the grid. The provided corrected program is indeed more comprehensive and accurately simulates the robot's movement:

```python
def can_reach_target(n, row1, row2):
    x, y = 1, 1  # Start at (1, 1)
    while True:
        if x == 2 and y == n:
            return True
        if x == 1 and y < n and row1[y] == '>':
            y += 1
        elif x == 1 and y > 1 and row1[y-1] == '<':
            y -= 1
        elif x == 2 and y < n and row2[y] == '>':
            y += 1
        elif x == 2 and y > 1 and row2[y-1] == '<':
            y -= 1
        else:
            break
        if x == 1:
            x = 2
        else:
            x = 1
    return False

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append('Yes' if can_reach_target(n, row1, row2) else 'No')
    print('\n'.join(results))

func_2()
```

This corrected program properly simulates the robot's movement and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

### Conclusion

The original assessment correctly identified the flaws in the given program and proposed a more accurate solution. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
