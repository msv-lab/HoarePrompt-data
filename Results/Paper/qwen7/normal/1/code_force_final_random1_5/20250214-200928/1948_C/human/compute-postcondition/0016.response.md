Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 1 up to but not including `n`, with a step of 2. This means `i` will take on odd values (1, 3, 5, ..., n-1) as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an input string
   - `b` is a new input string
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i]` equals `b[i + 1]` which is `<` or `a[i]` equals `b[i - 1]` which is `<`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` is currently 3, the next value of `i` would be 5 if `n` is greater than 5. However, since the loop increments by 2 each time, the next value of `i` will be 5 only if `n` is at least 6.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 2, so it will become 5 if `n` is at least 6.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1, and for the loop to continue, `n` must be at least 6 because `i` will be 5 in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5**
