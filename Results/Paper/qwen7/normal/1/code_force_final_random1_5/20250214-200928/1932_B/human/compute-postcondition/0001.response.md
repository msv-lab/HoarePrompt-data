State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is not relevant as it is a dummy variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` and the dummy variable `_`.
- The dummy variable `_` is used to iterate over the range of `t` and does not hold any specific state that needs adjustment.
- The variable `t` determines whether the loop will execute. Since `t` is given to be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), the loop will execute if `t` is within this range.
- Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is within the specified range.
