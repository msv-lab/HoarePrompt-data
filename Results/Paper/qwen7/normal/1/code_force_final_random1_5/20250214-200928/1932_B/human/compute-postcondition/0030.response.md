Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `year` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The line `year = 0` sets the variable `year` to 0. This updates the value of `year` while keeping the values of `n`, `t`, and `a` unchanged from their initial states.
