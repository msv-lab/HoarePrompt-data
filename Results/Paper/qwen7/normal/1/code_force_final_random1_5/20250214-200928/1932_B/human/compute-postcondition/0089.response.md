Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function calculates the smallest multiple of the last integer in the list that is greater than or equal to the initial value plus all increments made during the loop's iterations. It then returns a list of these final values for each test case.**
