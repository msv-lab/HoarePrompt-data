### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes `year` to 0, which will be used to track the current year.
3. **Processing Each Sign**: For each sign with periodicity `ai`, the program updates the `year` by adding `year % ai or ai` to it.
   - If `year % ai` is 0, this means the current year is a multiple of `ai`, so we add `ai` to `year`.
   - If `year % ai` is not 0, this means the current year is not a multiple of `ai`, so we add `ai - (year % ai)` to `year` to get to the next multiple of `ai`.
4. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final value of `year`.

This logic ensures that the program correctly calculates the year when all signs will occur sequentially.

### Correctness:
- The logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality.
- The program handles all given examples accurately.

**Correctness: **True**
