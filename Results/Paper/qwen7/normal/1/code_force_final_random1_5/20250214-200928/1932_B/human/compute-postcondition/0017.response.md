Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `year` is the sum of `year` incremented by `year % ai or ai` for each element `ai` in the list `a`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is reassigned to a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This list replaces the existing list `a`. The other variables (`year`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their previous values, except that `a` now holds the newly input list of integers.
