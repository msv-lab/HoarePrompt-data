Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    year = 0
    for ai in a:
        year += year % ai or ai
    print(year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `a` is a list of integers, `year` is the sum of `year` incremented by `year % ai or ai` for each element `ai` in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `year` will be the result of repeatedly adding either `year % ai` or `ai` to itself, where `ai` is each element in the list `a`. This means `year` will be the cumulative effect of applying the operation `year += year % ai or ai` for every element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `year` is the minimum value found among all elements in the list `a`, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `n` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `year` is the sum of `year + (year % ai or ai)` for each element `ai` in the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces with no elements remaining, `ai` is the last element of the list `a` that was processed.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` remains the same, `t` remains greater than 0, and `year` is the cumulative result of adding `(year % ai or ai)` for every element `ai` in the list `a`. The list `a` will be empty since all its elements have been processed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
