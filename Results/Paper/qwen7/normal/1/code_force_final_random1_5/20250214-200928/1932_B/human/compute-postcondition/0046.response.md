Postcondition: `current_year` is either `next_year + test` if `current_year % ai == 0`, or `next_year` is \((current_year // ai + 1) * ai\) otherwise. Here, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the second element of `test_cases`, `a` is a list with one element which is `test`, and `ai` is `test`.
