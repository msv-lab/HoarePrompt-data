Output State: **`a` is a list with one element `test`, `ai` is `test`, `next_year` is either `current_year + test + ai` if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, or `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` otherwise, and `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`**.

Explanation: The code `current_year = next_year` simply updates the value of `current_year` to the current value of `next_year`. The values of `a`, `ai`, and `next_year` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
