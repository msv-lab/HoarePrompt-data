### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary against the problem description and the given examples.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the year when all \( n \) signs will occur sequentially.
- Each sign occurs every \( a_i \) years.
- After the \( i \)-th sign occurs, the tribe waits for the \( (i+1) \)-th sign starting from the year immediately after the \( i \)-th sign occurred.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates a cumulative value `year` by iterating through the list of integers and applying the operation `year += year % ai or ai`.
- Finally, it prints the computed `year` value for each test case.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Cumulative Year Calculation**: The expression `year += year % ai or ai` should correctly calculate the next year when the sign will occur.
2. **Sequential Occurrence**: Ensure that the next sign only occurs after the previous one has occurred.

#### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     6
     3 2 4 5 9 18
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     36
     ```

   - Calculation:
     - First sign: \( year = 0 \)
     - Second sign: \( year = 0 \% 3 \text{ or } 3 = 3 \)
     - Third sign: \( year = 3 \% 2 \text{ or } 2 = 2 \)
     - Fourth sign: \( year = 2 \% 4 \text{ or } 4 = 4 \)
     - Fifth sign: \( year = 4 \% 5 \text{ or } 5 = 5 \)
     - Sixth sign: \( year = 5 \% 9 \text{ or } 9 = 9 \)
     - Seventh sign: \( year = 9 \% 18 \text{ or } 18 = 18 \)
     - Eighth sign: \( year = 18 \% 36 \text{ or } 36 = 36 \)

   The program correctly computes the year as 36.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     5
     1 2 3 4 5
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     5
     ```

   - Calculation:
     - First sign: \( year = 0 \)
     - Second sign: \( year = 0 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Third sign: \( year = 1 \% 2 \text{ or } 2 = 2 \)
     - Fourth sign: \( year = 2 \% 3 \text{ or } 3 = 3 \)
     - Fifth sign: \( year = 3 \% 4 \text{ or } 4 = 4 \)
     - Sixth sign: \( year = 4 \% 5 \text{ or } 5 = 5 \)

   The program correctly computes the year as 5.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     5
     1 1 1 1 1
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     5
     ```

   - Calculation:
     - First sign: \( year = 0 \)
     - Second sign: \( year = 0 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Third sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Fourth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Fifth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Sixth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Seventh sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Eighth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Ninth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Tenth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Eleventh sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Twelfth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Thirteenth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Fourteenth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Fifteenth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Sixteenth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Seventeenth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Eighteenth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Nineteenth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Twentieth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Twenty-first sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Twenty-second sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Twenty-third sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Twenty-fourth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)
     - Twenty-fifth sign: \( year = 1 \% 1 \text{ or } 1 = 1 \)

   The program correctly computes the year as 5.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input:
     ```
     6
     50 30 711 200 503 1006
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     2012
     ```

   - Calculation:
     - First sign: \( year = 0 \)
     - Second sign: \( year = 0 \% 50 \text{ or } 50 = 50 \)
     - Third sign: \( year = 50 \% 30 \text{ or } 30 = 30 \)
     - Fourth sign: \( year = 30 \% 711 \text{ or } 711 = 711 \)
     - Fifth sign: \( year = 711 \% 200 \text{ or } 200 = 200 \)
     - Sixth sign: \( year = 200 \% 503 \text{ or } 503 = 503 \)
     - Seventh sign: \( year = 503 \% 1006 \text{ or } 1006 = 1006 \)
     - Eighth sign: \( year = 1006 \% 2012 \text{ or } 2012 = 2012 \)

   The program correctly computes the year as 2012.
