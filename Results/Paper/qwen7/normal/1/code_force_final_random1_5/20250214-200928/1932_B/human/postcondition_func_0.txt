The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer t indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by an integer n and a list of n integers. For each test case, it calculates a cumulative value `year` by iterating through the list of integers and applying the operation `year += year % ai or ai`. Finally, it prints the computed `year` value for each test case.
