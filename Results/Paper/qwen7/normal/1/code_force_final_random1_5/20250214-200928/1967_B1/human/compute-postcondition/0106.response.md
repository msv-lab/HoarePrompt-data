Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the result of `int(g / count) + 1` added `m` times, `countmins` is `int(m)`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - 1`.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `count` will be equal to `m + 1`. The variable `ans` will be updated to the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `int(g / count) + 1` for each iteration from 3 to `m + 1`. The variable `countmins` will be set to `m`, and `g` will be calculated as `int(n / (m + 1)) - 1`.
