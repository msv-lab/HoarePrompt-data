Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is updated to `int(n / 2)`, and if `g` is less than `countmins`, then `g` remains `int(n / 2)`. If `g` is not less than `countmins`, then `g` remains unchanged.
