Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m`, `g` is updated to `int(n / count)` which is `int(n / 2)`, and the current value of `g` is less than `countmins`.
