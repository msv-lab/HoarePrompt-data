Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is `count + 1`, `ans` is `n + int(g / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is `count - 1`, `g` is `int(n / count) - int(count - 1)`**

Explanation: The line `countmins = int(count - 1)` simply reassigns the value of `count - 1` to `countmins`. Since `count` was previously updated to `count + 1`, the new value of `countmins` is `count - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
