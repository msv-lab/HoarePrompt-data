Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = n` simply assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `m`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged from their initial states.
