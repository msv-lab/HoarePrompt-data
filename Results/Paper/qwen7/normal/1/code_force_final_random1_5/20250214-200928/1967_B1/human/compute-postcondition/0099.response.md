Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is `count + 1`, `ans` is `n + int(g / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is `count - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (count + 1))`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged from their initial states.
