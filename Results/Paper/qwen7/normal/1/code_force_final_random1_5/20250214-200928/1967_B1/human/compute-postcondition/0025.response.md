Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `count <= m`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` must be 1
   - `m` must be at least 2
   - `count` is 2
   - `ans` is `n` + `int(g / count) + 1`
   - `countmins` is 0

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `count <= m` must be true.
   - Currently, `count` is 2 and `m` is at least 2.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `count` must be less than or equal to `m`.

Given that `count` is currently 2 and `m` is at least 2, we need to ensure that `count` remains within the range where `count <= m` holds true. Since `count` is already 2, it needs to stay at 2 or increase to a value less than or equal to `m`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `count` remains 2 or increases to a value less than or equal to `m`.
   - Since `m` is at least 2, no adjustment is necessary for `m`.
   - `count` should remain 2 or increase to a value less than or equal to `m`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `count` should remain 2 or increase to a value less than or equal to `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1, `m` must be at least 2, `count` must be 2 or less than or equal to `m`, `ans` is `n` + `int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is 0**
