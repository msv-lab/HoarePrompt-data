Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / 2)` and the current value of `g` is less than `countmins`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a block of code. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the loop or block it is within. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial or last known states.
