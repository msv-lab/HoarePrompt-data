Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first input.
   - `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2.
   - `count` is `m + 1`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the result of `int(g / count) + 1` added `m` times.
   - `countmins` is `int(m)`.
   - `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is fixed at 3.
   - `count` is `m + 1`.
   - `countmins` is `int(m)`, so it's just `m` since `m` is an integer.
   - `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - 1`.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - `ans` is initialized with `n` and then incremented `m` times by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to it.
   - Since `count` is `m + 1`, `int(g / count)` will always be 0 because `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - 1`, and dividing any positive integer by `m + 1` will give a quotient of 0 (since `m + 1` is at least 3 and `n` is at least 1).

4. **Final Value of `ans`:**
   - `ans` starts as `n` and is incremented `m` times by `0 + 1`, which is 1.
   - Therefore, `ans = n + m`.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement will output the integer value of `ans`, which is `n + m`.

Given this reasoning, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **n + m (where n is the integer value of the first input and m is the integer value of the second input)**
