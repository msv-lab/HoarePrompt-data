Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is now `count + 1`, `ans` is `n` + `int(g / count) + 2`, `countmins` is `count - 1`, `g` is `int(n / count) - (count - 1)`**.

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
