Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the value of `t` is updated to the input integer, which must still satisfy this condition. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
