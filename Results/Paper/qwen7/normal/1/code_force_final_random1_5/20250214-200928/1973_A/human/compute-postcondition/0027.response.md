Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1` appended to the original list, because `total_points` is odd.**

Explanation: The code updates `total_matchs` to be `total_points // 2`. All other variables (`total_points`, `egalites`, and `resultats`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
