Output State: **`p1` is the first element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p2` is the second element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p3` is the third element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`; `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation: The code `total_matchs = total_points // 2` updates the value of `total_matchs` to be the integer division of `total_points` by 2. However, since the value of `total_points` is defined as `p1 + p2 + p3`, and no new values for `p1`, `p2`, or `p3` are introduced, these variables remain unchanged. The rest of the variables (`egalites` and `resultats`) are also unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
