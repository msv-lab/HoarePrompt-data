Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1` appended to the original list, and `(p1, p2, p3)` is the next tuple from `cas_de_test`.**

Explanation: The code appends `-1` to the `resultats` list. Since `resultats` was originally either a list containing `-1` or a list containing `egalites // 2`, appending `-1` to it changes its content to a list containing `-1`. The values of `total_matchs`, `total_points`, `egalites`, and `(p1, p2, p3)` remain unchanged.
