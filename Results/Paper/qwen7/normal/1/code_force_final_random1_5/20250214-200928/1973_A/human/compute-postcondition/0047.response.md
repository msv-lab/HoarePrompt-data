Output State: **`p1` is the first element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p2` is the second element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p3` is the third element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `egalites` is updated to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`; `resultats` is a list containing `-1, -1` if `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`; `resultats` has appended `egalites // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends `egalites // 2` to the list `resultats`. Since `egalites` is already calculated, appending `egalites // 2` to `resultats` does not change the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_matchs`, `total_points`, or `egalites`. The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is not checked here, so `resultats` remains as a list containing `-1, -1` if the condition was true previously.
