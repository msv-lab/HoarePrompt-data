Output State: **`p1` is the first element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p2` is the second element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p3` is the third element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`; `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation: The given code does not change any of the existing variables. It only defines the `total_points` as the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The other variables (`total_matchs`, `egalites`, and `resultats`) are also defined based on the current values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the updated definitions of the variables.
