Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `cas_de_test` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `resultats` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p1, p2, p3 in cas_de_test:
    total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
    if total_points % 2 != 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    total_matchs = total_points // 2
    if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
    if egalites < 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
    else:
        resultats.append(egalites // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and `resultats` is either a list containing `-1` or a list containing `egalites // 2` depending on whether `egalites < 0` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`. If `egalites < 0`, then `resultats` becomes a list containing `-1, -1`. Otherwise, `resultats` becomes a list containing `-1, egalites // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p1` is the first element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p2` is the second element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `p3` is the third element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `egalites` is updated to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`; `resultats` is a list containing `-1, -1, -1` if `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing `-1, -1` and `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
