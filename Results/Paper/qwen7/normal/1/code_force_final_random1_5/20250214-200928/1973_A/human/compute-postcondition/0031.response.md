Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation: The code reassigns the value of `egalites` using the same formula `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. Since this is just a reassignment and no new values are introduced, the other variables (`total_matchs`, `total_points`, `egalites`, and `resultats`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
