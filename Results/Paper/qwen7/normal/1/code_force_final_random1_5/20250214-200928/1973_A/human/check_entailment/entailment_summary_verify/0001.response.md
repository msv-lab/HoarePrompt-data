### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `t` to 7 and `cas_de_test` with predefined test cases. This part is correct and serves as input for the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case and calculates the total points and total matches.
   - It checks if the total points are even, which is necessary because each match contributes either 2 points (to the winners) or 1 point to each player in a draw.
   - It then calculates the total number of matches from the total points.
   - It checks if the total number of matches is more than 3 (since there are only 3 players) or if the highest score (`p3`) exceeds the total number of matches, which would be impossible.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the formula derived from the points distribution.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it appends `-1` to the results list, indicating an invalid configuration.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the list of results, which are then printed.

### Analysis:

- **Total Points Check**: The check for `total_points % 2 != 0` ensures that the total points are even, which is necessary for the points distribution to be valid.
- **Total Matches Calculation**: The calculation of `total_matchs = total_points // 2` correctly determines the total number of matches.
- **Match Constraints**: The checks `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` ensure that the number of matches and the highest score are feasible.
- **Draw Calculation**: The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` and the subsequent division by 2 correctly calculates the number of draws.

However, there is a critical issue with the function summary provided and the implementation of the function. The function summary mentions that the function should handle cases where `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`, but the actual test cases include values up to 30, which is consistent with the problem statement. However, the function does not handle cases where the sum of points is odd or where the highest score exceeds the total number of matches properly.

### Detailed Issues:

1. **Odd Total Points**:
   - The function correctly checks if `total_points % 2 != 0` and appends `-1` if true. This is correct because an odd total points cannot be distributed among the players under the given rules.

2. **Total Matches Constraint**:
   - The check `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is incorrect. The correct constraint should be `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs / 2`. The function should check if `p3` can be achieved within the total number of matches divided by 2 (since each match can contribute at most 2 points to the highest scorer).

3. **Draw Calculation**:
   - The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is almost correct but needs adjustment. The correct formula should be `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) - (total_matchs - p3)`. This ensures that the number of draws is calculated correctly.

### Corrected Implementation:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs / 2:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) - (total_matchs - p3)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function does not correctly handle the constraints and the draw calculation. The corrected implementation addresses these issues.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
