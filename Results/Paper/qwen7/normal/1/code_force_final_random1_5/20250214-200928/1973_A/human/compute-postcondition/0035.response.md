Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `cas_de_test`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - `total_matchs` is calculated as `total_points // 2`.
   - `total_points` is calculated as `p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - `resultats` is initialized as a list containing `-1`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - If `egalites < 0`, then `resultats` becomes a list containing `-1, -1`.
   - Otherwise, `resultats` becomes a list containing `-1, egalites // 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over different tuples `(p1, p2, p3)` from `cas_de_test`, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will change for each iteration.
   - `total_matchs` and `total_points` will be recalculated based on the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - `egalites` will be recalculated based on the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - `resultats` will be updated based on the new value of `egalites`.

Given the above, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_matchs`, `total_points`, `egalites`, and `resultats`.

Since the loop is about to start a new iteration, the initial values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the next tuple in `cas_de_test` will be used.

**State:**
- `p1` is the first element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p2` is the second element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p3` is the third element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`.
- `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`.
- `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
- `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.

So, the final state for the next iteration is:

State: **`p1` is the first element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the next tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`**.
