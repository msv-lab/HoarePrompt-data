Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `visited[i]` is True
   - `coef[i]` is 1
   - `tot` is 0
   - `ok` is True because `ok or bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to True.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0. Since `n` is not modified within the loop, it remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - The other states (`visited[i]`, `coef[i]`, `tot`, and `ok`) are not directly modified by the loop itself and do not change based on the loop head variables alone. They might be modified inside the loop body, but we cannot assume anything about their values without seeing the loop body. However, since the question asks us to focus only on the loop head variables, we do not need to adjust these states.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
