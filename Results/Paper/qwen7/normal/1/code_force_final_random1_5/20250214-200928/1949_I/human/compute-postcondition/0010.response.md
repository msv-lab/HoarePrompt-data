Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x[1]` is an input integer.
   - `y[1]` is an input integer.
   - `r[1]` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1 (as it was at the end of the previous iteration).

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x[1]` is an input integer, `y[1]` is an input integer, `r[1]` is an input integer**
