n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of length n, where for each 0 ≤ i < n, x[i], y[i] are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^9, and r[i] is an integer such that 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9. visited is a list of boolean values of length n initialized to False. coef is a list of length n initialized to None.
