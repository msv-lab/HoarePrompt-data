Output State: **`ok` is True, `bipartite` is True, `tot` is 0**

Explanation: The initial state includes `i` being greater than 1, `n` being greater than 0, `coef[1]` being 1, `tot` being 0, and `bipartite` being True. The code `ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0` updates the value of `ok`. Since `bipartite` is True and `tot` is 0 (which means `tot != 0` is False), the expression `bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to False. Therefore, `ok` remains unchanged from its initial state (which is not specified but implied to be False initially since no prior assignment is given). However, since `ok` is set to `ok or False`, `ok` remains True if it was True before, which aligns with the initial state's implication. Thus, `ok` is True, `bipartite` is True, and `tot` remains 0.
