Based on the initial state provided:

- All nodes from 0 to n-1 have been processed, meaning `visited[i]` is True for every `i` in the range of `n`.
- The value of `coef[i]` is 1 for every `i` where `visited[i]` is True.
- The value of `tot` is the sum of all non-zero contributions made during the DFS calls for each component.
- `bipartite` is True for each component where the graph is bipartite and `tot` is not zero.
- `ok` is True if any component is bipartite and `tot` is not zero. The condition `ok` is True.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Given that `ok` is True, it confirms that there exists at least one component that is both bipartite and has a non-zero `tot` value. This condition directly leads to the string 'YES' being printed.

Output: **YES**
