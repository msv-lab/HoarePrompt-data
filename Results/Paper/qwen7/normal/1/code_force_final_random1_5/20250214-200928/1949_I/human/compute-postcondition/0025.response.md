Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `visited[i]` is True, `coef[i]` is 1, `tot` is 0, and `ok` is True because `ok or bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to True since `bipartite` is True and `tot` is 0 (which means the condition `tot != 0` is False, but the overall expression is True due to the `or` operator).
