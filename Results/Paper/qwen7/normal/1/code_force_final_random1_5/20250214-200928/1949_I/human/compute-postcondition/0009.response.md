Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x[1]` is an input integer, `y[1]` is an input integer, `r[1]` is an input integer, `x[1]` is an integer from the input, `y[1]` is an integer from the input, `r[1]` is an integer from the input**

Explanation: The code `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. Since `i` is 1, the values of `x[1]`, `y[1]`, and `r[1]` are set to the integers entered by the user. All other variables remain unchanged.
