Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `coef[2]` remains unchanged (which is 1), `tot` is either 0 or incremented by a value related to `visited[i]` (which is not explicitly defined in the if part but remains consistent with the initial state), `bipartite` remains True, and `ok` remains True.
