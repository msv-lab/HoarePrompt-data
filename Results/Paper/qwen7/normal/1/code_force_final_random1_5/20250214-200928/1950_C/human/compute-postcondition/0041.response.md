Functionality: **The function processes a series of time inputs in the format "hh:mm" and converts them to a 12-hour clock format, printing either "AM" or "PM" based on the hour. It iterates this process for a number of times specified by the user, where each iteration corresponds to one input. After processing all inputs, it does not return any value but prints the converted times directly.**
