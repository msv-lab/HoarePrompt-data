Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is the input string, `h` is the first two characters of `s`. After executing the if-else block, `h` is either '00' or not '00'. If `h` is not '00', the condition remains unchanged whether `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12 or greater than 12.
