Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `h` is the first two characters of `s`.

2. **Condition in the Code**:
   - The if-else block checks if `h` is not '00'.
   - If `h` is not '00', it further checks if `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12 or greater than 12.
   - The value of `h` after the if-else block is either '00' or not '00'.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])`.
   - `s[2:]` will be the substring of `s` starting from the third character to the end.
   - `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` will return 'AM' if `int(h) >= 12` and 'PM' otherwise.

Given the conditions:
- Since `h` is either '00' or not '00', we need to consider both cases:
  - If `h` is '00', the condition `int(h) >= 12` will be false, so `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` will return 'AM'.
  - If `h` is not '00', the condition `int(h) >= 12` will determine whether 'AM' or 'PM' is returned.

Therefore, the print statement will output the substring of `s` starting from the third character followed by either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Output: **s[2:] ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]**
