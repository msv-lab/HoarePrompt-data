To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `l` is within the range `[0, int(input()) - a[s - 1] - 1)`.
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (int(input()) - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])`.
   - `i` is set to 2.
   - `ql` is set to `int(input()) - a[s - 1]`.
   - `s` is the index where the new value of `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted.

2. **Key Variables**:
   - `int(input())`: This is an input from the user, let's denote it as `user_input`.
   - `a[s - 1]`: This is the element at index `s - 1` in the list `a`.
   - `bd[s]`: This is the element at index `s` in the list `bd`.
   - `ad[s]`: This is the element at index `s` in the list `ad`.
   - `b[s - 1]`: This is the element at index `s - 1` in the list `b`.

3. **Calculation of `m`**:
   - `m = b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (user_input - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])`

4. **Calculation of `ql`**:
   - `ql = user_input - a[s - 1]`

5. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement outputs `int(m)` followed by a space (`end=' '`).

Given these steps, the value of `m` will be computed based on the user input and the values of `a[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, and `ad[s]`. Since the exact values of these variables are not provided, we can only describe the computation.

Output: **int(b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (user_input - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]))**
