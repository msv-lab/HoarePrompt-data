Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input parameters for the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`.
2. It initializes the lists `a` and `b` with the given values and computes the differences between consecutive elements to get `ad` and `bd`.
3. It then calculates the speeds (`v`) between the points based on the differences.
4. For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `a` where the query point `ql` lies.
5. If `ql` exactly matches a point in `a`, it directly returns the corresponding value from `b`.
6. Otherwise, it performs linear interpolation to estimate the time taken to reach `ql` based on the speeds between the relevant segments.
7. The program handles all test cases and queries as specified, and the logic appears to correctly implement the requirements.

Given this analysis, the program seems to follow the correct approach to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
