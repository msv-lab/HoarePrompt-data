Postcondition: `l` is within the range `[1, a[s - 1] - 1)`, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where the new value of `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, no changes are made; otherwise, the conditions remain as initially described.
