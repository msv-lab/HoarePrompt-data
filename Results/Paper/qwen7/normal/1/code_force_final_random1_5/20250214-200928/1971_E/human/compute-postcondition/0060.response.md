Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for l in range(q)`. The variables involved here are `l` and `q`.

2. **Determine the current values of these variables**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 1.
   - `q` is the length of the list `a`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `l < q`.
   - Since `l` is currently 1, for the next iteration, `l` should be incremented to 2.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `l` needs to be updated to 2.
   - `q` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of the list `a`, which does not change within the loop.

5. **List the remaining variables and their states**:
   - `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`.
   - `q` is `len(a)`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is `bisect_left(a, ql)`.
   - `ql` is an input integer `- a[s - 1]`.
   - `l` is now 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`, `q` is `len(a)`, `i` is 1, `s` is `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer `- a[s - 1]`, `l` is 2**
