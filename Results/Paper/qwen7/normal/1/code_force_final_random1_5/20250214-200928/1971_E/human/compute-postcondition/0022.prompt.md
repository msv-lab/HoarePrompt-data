Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing `len(a) - 1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `bd` is a list containing only one element which is 0, `i` is `len(a)`, `len(a)` is greater than 1.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `ad` will contain the differences between consecutive elements of the list `a`, starting from the second element of `a`. The length of `ad` will be one less than the length of `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `a`, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `b`, `bd`) will remain in their initial states.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing `len(a) - 1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `bd` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is 2, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `len(b)` is greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing `len(a) - 1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `bd` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are `0` and `b[1] - b[0]`, `i` is 3, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `len(b)` is greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing `len(a) - 1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `bd` is a list containing four elements where the first three elements are `0`, `b[1] - b[0]`, and the fourth element is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is 4, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `len(b)` is greater than 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
