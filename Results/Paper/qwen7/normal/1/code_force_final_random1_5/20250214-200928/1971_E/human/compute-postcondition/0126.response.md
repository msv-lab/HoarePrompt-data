The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. However, the given code does not specify which loop this `continue` statement belongs to, and no loop is shown in the provided initial state. Since the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of its loop context, and no loop context is provided, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is within the range `[0, int(input()) - a[s - 1] - 1)`, `m` is 0, `i` is 2, `ql` is decreased by `a[s - 1]` and is now `int(input())`, `s` is the index where the new value of `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and `s` is assigned the value of the bisect_left(a, ql)**
