Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` in the range from 1 to `len(b)`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 1 and increments by default in a `range` function). Thus, `i` should be 4 for the next iteration.

4. **List `bd`**: The list `bd` contains the values `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[3] - b[2]`. This information does not change based on the value of `i` within the loop head, so it remains the same.

5. **List `b`**: Since the value of `i` is used to access elements in the list `b` but does not change the length or content of `b`, the length of `b` remains the same. However, since `i` is incremented to 4, the condition for the next iteration will be checked against `len(b)`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `bd` is a list containing the values `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[3] - b[2]`**
