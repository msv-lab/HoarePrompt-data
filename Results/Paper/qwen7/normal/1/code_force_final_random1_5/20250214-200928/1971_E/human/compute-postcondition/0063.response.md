Output State: **`m` is 0, `q` is len(a), `i` is 1, `s` is bisect_left(a, ql), `ql` is an input integer, `l` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer directly to `ql`. The other variables (`m`, `q`, `i`, `s`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
