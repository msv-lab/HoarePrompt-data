Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, len(b)):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(b)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `bd` is a list with two elements, where the first element is `b[1] - b[0]` and the second element is `b[3] - b[2]`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - Therefore, `i` must be 4 for the loop to continue.
   - Additionally, since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `len(b)`, `len(b)` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
   - `bd` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `i` is 4, `bd` is a list with two elements, where the first element is `b[1] - b[0]` and the second element is `b[3] - b[2]`.**
