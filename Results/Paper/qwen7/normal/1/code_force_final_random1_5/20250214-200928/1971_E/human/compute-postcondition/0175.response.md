Output State: **`v` now contains the value of `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]` and `ad[i] / bd[i]`, `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Initially, `v` contained the value of `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]`. After executing the code, `v` now includes both `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]` and `ad[i] / bd[i]`. The lists `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged.
