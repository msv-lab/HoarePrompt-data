Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for l in range(q)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `l` and `q`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `l` is 0
   - `m` is `bd[s - 1] * (ql / ad[s - 1]) + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`
   - `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `l` is less than `q`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `l` starts from 0 and the loop increments `l` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `l` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - The value of `q` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust other variables**: The other variables (`i`, `m`, and `ql`) are not directly affected by the loop itself and do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is `bd[s - 1] * (ql / ad[s - 1]) + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`, and `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]`**
