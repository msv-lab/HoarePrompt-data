Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])`**.

Explanation: The variable `m` is updated by adding the value of `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` to its current value `b[s - 1]`. The values of `i`, `l`, `ql`, `bd`, `s`, `ad`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
