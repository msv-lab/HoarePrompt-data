Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is 0, and `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `m` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `i`, `l`, and `ql` remain unchanged from their initial states. The expression for `m` is no longer valid since it is now directly set to `0`. The value of `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]`, which means `ql` has its value decreased by the amount stored in `a[s - 1]`.
