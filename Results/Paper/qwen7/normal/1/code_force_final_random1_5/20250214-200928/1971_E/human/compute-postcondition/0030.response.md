Output State: **`v` is a list with four elements: the first element is `ad[1] / bd[1]`, the second element is `ad[2] / bd[2]`, the third element is `ad[2] / bd[2]`, and the fourth element is `ad[3] / bd[3]`, `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The code `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])` appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Given that `i` is initially 3, `ad[i] / bd[i]` translates to `ad[3] / bd[3]`. This value is appended to the list `v`, which previously had three elements. Therefore, `v` now has four elements, and `i` is incremented to 4.
