Output State: **`l` is within the range `[1, a[s - 1] - 1)`, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where the new value of `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `s` is the index returned by bisect_left(a, ql)**.

The code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` updates the variable `s` to the index where `ql` would be inserted into the sorted list `a` to maintain its sorted order. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
