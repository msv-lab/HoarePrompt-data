Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing `len(a) - 1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `bd` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are `0` and `b[1] - b[0]`, `i` is 3, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `len(b)` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 3, `bd` now contains three elements: the first two elements are `0` and `b[1] - b[0]`, and the third element is `b[3] - b[2]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
