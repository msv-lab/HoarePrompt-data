Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `l` and `q`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: The state before the loop starts mentions that `v` contains the values of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for every `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, and `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged. This information is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop head variables.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than `q`.

Given that the loop will continue to execute as long as `l < q`, the initial value of `l` should be 0 (the starting point of the loop), and `q` must be a positive integer greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `l` should be 0.
- `q` must be greater than 0.

State: **`l` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0**
