Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(a))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ad` is a list with one additional element which is the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.
   - `a` and `i` retain their previous values.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(a)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be within the range.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if `i` was previously `k`, it will now be `k + 1`.
   - The value of `a` remains unchanged.
   - The list `ad` will have one more element added, which is the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` for the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was previously `k` and now it is `k + 1`, let's denote the new value of `i` as `k + 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ad` will have one more element, which is the difference between `a[k + 1]` and `a[k]`.
   - `a` retains its previous values.
   - `i` is now `k + 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ad` is a list with one additional element which is the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, `a` retains its previous values, `i` is `i + 1`**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` is now `k + 1`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`ad` is a list with one additional element which is the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, `a` retains its previous values, `i` is `i + 1`**.

If we denote the previous value of `i` as `k`, then the new state would be:

State: **`ad` is a list with one additional element which is the difference between `a[k + 1]` and `a[k]`, `a` retains its previous values, `i` is `k + 1`**.
