Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `len(b)`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `bd` is a list with one element equal to `b[1] - b[0]`
   - `len(b)` must be greater than 1

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and increments `i` by `1` each time, if `i` is currently `2`, it will be incremented to `3` in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(b)` must still be greater than `1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `3`.
   - `len(b)` must remain greater than `1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `bd` is a list with one element equal to `b[1] - b[0]`, `len(b)` must be greater than 1**
