Output State: **`i` is len(`a`) - 1, `bd` will still hold the differences as calculated, `v` will be a list of length len(`a`) where the first element is 0 and the rest are the results of dividing corresponding elements of `b` by `bd`, `t` is len(`a`), `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from input, `a` is updated to be [0] followed by integers entered by the user, `b` is [0] followed by integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is then prepended with a `0`. The variable `b` is updated to this new list. The other variables (`i`, `bd`, `v`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
