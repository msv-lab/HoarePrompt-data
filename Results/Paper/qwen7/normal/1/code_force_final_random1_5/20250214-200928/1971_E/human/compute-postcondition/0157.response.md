Output State: **`ad` now has its last element updated to `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Since `i` was already incremented by 1, it remains as `i + 1`. The initial state's information about `ad` having its last element appended with `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is now updated to reflect the new value.
