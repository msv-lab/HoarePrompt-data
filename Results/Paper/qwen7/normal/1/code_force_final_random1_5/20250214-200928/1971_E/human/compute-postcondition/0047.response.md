Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for l in range(q)`. The only variable here is `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `m` is increased by `bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`.
   - `q` is equal to `len(a)`.
   - `m` is now `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in the sorted list `a`.
   - `ql` is decreased by `a[s - 1]`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `l` in the range of `q`, the variable `l` will be incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - The other variables (`m`, `q`, `i`, `s`, and `ql`) are not directly affected by the loop itself but may change due to the loop body, which is omitted.

Given the information provided, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `l`. Initially, `l` starts from 0 (since `range(q)` means `l` will iterate from 0 to `q-1`). After the first iteration, `l` will be 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

**State: **`m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`, `q` is `len(a)`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in the sorted list `a`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `l` is 1**
