Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `l` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `s` is determined by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers inputted by the user, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The code `b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` creates a new list `b` by concatenating `[0]` with the list of integers obtained from user input. The input is split into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial values of `i`, `q`, `l`, `s`, `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged, and the list `a` remains as initially defined. The new list `b` is created based on the user input.
