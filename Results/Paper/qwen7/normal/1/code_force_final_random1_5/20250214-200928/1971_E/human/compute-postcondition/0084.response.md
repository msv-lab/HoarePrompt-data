Output State: **`ad` is a list with one additional element which is the difference between `a[k + 1]` and `a[k + 1 - 1]` (i.e., `a[k]`), `a` retains its previous values, `i` is `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, `a[i]` is `a[k + 1]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[k]`. Therefore, the new element appended to `ad` is the difference between `a[k + 1]` and `a[k]`. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged.
