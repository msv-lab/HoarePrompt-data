Output State: **`l` is within the range `[1, a[s - 1] - 1)`, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where the new value of `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `s` is the index returned by bisect_left(a, ql)**.

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not change any variable values or affect the conditions. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.
