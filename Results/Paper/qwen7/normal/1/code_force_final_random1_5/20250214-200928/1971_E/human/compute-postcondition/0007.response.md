State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing only one element which is 0, `bd` is a list containing only one element which is 0, `i` is 1, `len(a)` is greater than 1**

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is set to start from 1, as specified in the range function `range(1, len(a))`.
- For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have more than one element (i.e., `len(a) > 1`). If `len(a)` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.
