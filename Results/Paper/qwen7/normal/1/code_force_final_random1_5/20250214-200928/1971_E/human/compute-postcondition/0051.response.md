Output State: **`m` is 0, `q` is len(a), `i` is 1, `s` is bisect_left(a, ql), `ql` is an input integer, `l` is 1**

Explanation: The code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` assigns the value of the leftmost index where `ql` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list `a` to the variable `s`. The other variables (`m`, `q`, `i`, `l`) remain unchanged. Since `ql` is an input integer, its value is not known, and thus `s` will be the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in the sorted list `a`.
