Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the range is `range(1, len(a))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `v` contains the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`.
   - `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `len(a) - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value less than `len(a)`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will now be equal to the previous value of `i + 1`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `v` will contain the value of `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]` because `i` is incremented.
   - `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`v` contains the value of `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]`, `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged**.
