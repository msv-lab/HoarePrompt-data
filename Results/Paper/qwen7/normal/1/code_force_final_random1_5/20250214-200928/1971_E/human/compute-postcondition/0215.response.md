Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is 0, `ql` is `ql` - `a[s - 1]`**.

In this state, `i` remains unchanged at 1, `l` remains unchanged at 2, and `m` remains unchanged at 0. The variable `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`. The condition `if a[s] equals ql, we continue the loop` remains valid as per the initial state.
