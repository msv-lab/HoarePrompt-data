Output State: **`new2[i+1]` is the maximum value between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `new[i+1]` is the minimum value between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was previously less than the length of `a`, it is now `i + 1`. The values of `new2[i]` and `new[i]` are determined based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and these comparisons remain unchanged. Therefore, the new values for `i+1` are derived from the same logic applied to the next index.
