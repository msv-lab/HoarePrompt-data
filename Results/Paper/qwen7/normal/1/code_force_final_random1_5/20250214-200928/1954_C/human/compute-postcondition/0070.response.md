Output State: **`new2[i]` is assigned the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `i` is increased by 1 and is now less than `len(a)`**.

This means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and it remains less than the length of list `a`. The values of `new2`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their previous states, except that `i` has been updated.
