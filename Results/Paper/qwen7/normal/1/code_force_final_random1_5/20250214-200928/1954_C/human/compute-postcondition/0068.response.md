Output State: **`new[i]` is assigned the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `i` is increased by 1 and must be less than `len(a)`**.

This means that the variable `new[i]` is now holding the smaller value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Additionally, the variable `i` has been incremented by 1 and must still be less than the length of list `a`. All other variables remain in their initial state.
