Output State: **`i` is `len(a)`, `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(a[i], b[i])` to `new[i]`. Here, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, so `new[len(a)]` is set to the minimum value between `a[len(a)]` and `b[len(a)]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
