Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `a`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is equal to `i + 1` (This seems to be a typo or an incomplete state description. Let's assume `i` is some value, say `i = k`).
   - `new2[i]` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
   - `new[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < len(a)` must be true. Therefore, `i` must be less than the length of `a`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`. 
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be incremented such that `i < len(a)`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be set to a value that satisfies the condition `i < len(a)`. Since `i` was previously `k`, it should be incremented to `k + 1` to check the next element in the list `a`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `new2[i]` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`**.

However, to explicitly state the requirement for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure `i` is less than the length of `a`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` must be less than the length of `a`, `new2[i]` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`**.
