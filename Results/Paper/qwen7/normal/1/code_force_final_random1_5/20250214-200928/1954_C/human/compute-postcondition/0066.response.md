Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the indices where `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]` during the loop's execution, `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the indices where `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]` during the loop's execution, and `new2[i]` is updated to be the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the current index `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The lists `new` and `new2` remain unchanged in terms of their construction process, which involves comparing elements of `a` and `b` at the indices where they are equal. The specific values within these lists do not change; they continue to be determined by the conditions described in the initial state.
