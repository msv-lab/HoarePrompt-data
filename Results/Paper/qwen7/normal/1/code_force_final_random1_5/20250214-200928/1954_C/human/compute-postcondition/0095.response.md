Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `new2[0]` is equal to `min(a[0], b[0])`
   - `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on two variables: `i` and `a[i] == b[i]`.
   - We need to ensure that both conditions are met for the loop to continue.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)` and `a[i]` must be equal to `b[i]`.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(a)`.
   - Additionally, we need to ensure that `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]` for the loop to continue.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The variable `i` must be adjusted to ensure it is less than `len(a)`.
   - The value of `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`i` must be less than `len(a)` and `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`**
