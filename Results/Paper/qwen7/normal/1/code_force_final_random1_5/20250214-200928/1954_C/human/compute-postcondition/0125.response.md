Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
- `new` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where `a[i-1]` was equal to `b[i-1]` during the loop's execution.
- `new2` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where `a[i-1]` was equal to `b[i-1]` during the loop's execution.

The print statement is:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
```

This statement will join the elements of the `new` list into a single string, with each element converted to a string and concatenated together without any separators.

To determine the exact output, we need to know the values of `a` and `b` during the loop's execution. However, since these values are not provided, we can only describe the process and the expected output format.

The `new` list contains the minimum values from corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where those elements were equal during the loop's execution. Therefore, the output will be a string formed by joining these minimum values.

Output: **a string formed by joining the minimum values from corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where those elements were equal during the loop's execution**
