Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the product of `x` and `y`. The function simply prints the minimum and maximum digits at each position without considering the overall goal of maximizing the product. 

Here's a breakdown of why the function is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Objective**: The function aims to print the minimum and maximum digits at each position but does not consider the overall goal of maximizing the product of the two numbers. Maximizing the product involves strategically swapping digits to form the largest possible numbers.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The current logic only checks if the digits at the current position are the same and then assigns the maximum and minimum values accordingly. It does not consider the impact of such swaps on the overall product of the two numbers.

3. **No Strategy for Maximization**: There is no strategy implemented to ensure that the digits are swapped in a way that would maximize the product. For instance, it should prioritize placing larger digits in the higher place values of both numbers.

Given these points, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem statement and therefore is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
