Output State: **`num_iterations - 1` is the input value for the next iteration; `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string; `b` is a list of integers converted from the current input.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, list(input())))` takes the input from the user, converts it into a list of characters, and then maps each character to an integer using the `map` function. This results in a new list `b` containing integers. The initial state's value of `num_iterations - 1` remains unchanged, and the list `a` is unaffected by this operation.
