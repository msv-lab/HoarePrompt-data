To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the given conditions:

1. The loop condition is `i < len(a)`.
2. The loop head involves the variable `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < len(a)` must be true. Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is `i` is equal to `i + 1`, this implies that `i` has just incremented by 1.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a)` after the increment. Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(a)` before the increment.

Let's summarize the required adjustments:

- The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` was equal to the previous value of `i`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is less than `len(a)`.

State: **`i` is less than `len(a)`**
