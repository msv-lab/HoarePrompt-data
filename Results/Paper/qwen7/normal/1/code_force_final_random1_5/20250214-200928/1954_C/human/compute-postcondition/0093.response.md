Output State: **`i` is 0; `new2[0]` is equal to `min(a[0], b[0])`; `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `a[0]` and `b[0]` to `new2[0]`. Since `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]`, `new2[0]` will be equal to `a[0]` (or `b[0]`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
