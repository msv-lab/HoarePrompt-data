You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings of equal length consisting of digits from '1' to '9'.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        new = [None] * len(a)
        
        new2 = [None] * len(a)
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        
        if i != len(a):
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
            while i < len(a):
                new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
                new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
                i += 1
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is equal to the length of list `a`. For every index `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`, `new[j]` contains the minimum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`, and `new2[j]` contains the maximum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, both `new` and `new2` will contain the results of comparing each pair of elements from lists `a` and `b`. Specifically, `new` will store the minimum values and `new2` will store the maximum values for each corresponding position in the input lists `a` and `b`. The loop processes the lists character by character, updating `new` and `new2` based on whether the characters match or differ, ensuring that by the end, all elements have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the two strings `x` and `y` are equal.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
