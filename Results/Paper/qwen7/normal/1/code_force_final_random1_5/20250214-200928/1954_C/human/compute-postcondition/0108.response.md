Output State: **`i` is one more than the length of `a` and equals the previous value of `i` plus 1; `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where `a[i-1]` was equal to `b[i-1]` during the loop iterations; `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where `a[i-1]` was equal to `b[i-1]` during the loop's execution; the condition `i != len(a)` is now false.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, making it one more than the length of `a`. Since `i` was previously one more than the length of `a`, adding 1 to it makes it exactly equal to the length of `a`. Additionally, the condition `i != len(a)` is no longer true because `i` is now equal to `len(a)`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
