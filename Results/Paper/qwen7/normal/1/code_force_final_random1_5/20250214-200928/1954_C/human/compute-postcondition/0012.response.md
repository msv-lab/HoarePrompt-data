Output State: **`i` is 2; `new[2]` is equal to `max(a[2], b[2])`; `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `new[2]` is set to the maximum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`. The values of `a[1]` and `b[1]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
