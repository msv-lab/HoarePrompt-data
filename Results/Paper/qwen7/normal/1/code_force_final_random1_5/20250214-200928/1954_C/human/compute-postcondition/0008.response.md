Output State: **`i` is 0; `new[0]` is equal to `max(a[0], b[0])`; `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[0]` and `b[0]` to `new[0]`. Since `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`, `new[0]` will take the value of `a[0]` (or equivalently `b[0]`). The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
