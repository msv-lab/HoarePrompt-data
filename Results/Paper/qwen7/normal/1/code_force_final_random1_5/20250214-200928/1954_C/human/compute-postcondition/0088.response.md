Output State: **`num_iterations - 1` is the input value for the next iteration; `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string; `b` is a list of integers converted from the current input; `new` is a list of length equal to `a` filled with `None` values.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `new` with a length equal to the length of the list `a`, and fills it with `None` values. The values of `num_iterations - 1`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
