Output State: **`num_iterations - 1` is the input value for the next iteration; `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string; `b` is a list of integers converted from the current input; `new` is a list of length equal to `a` filled with `None` values; `new2` is a list of length equal to `a` filled with `None` values.**

The code initializes `new2` as a list of `None` values with the same length as the list `a`. The values of `num_iterations - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `new` remain unchanged from their initial states.
