Output State: **`i` is 1; `new2[0]` is equal to `min(a[0], b[0])`; `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. The values of `new2[0]` and `a[0]` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code. Since `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`, this relationship also remains valid.
