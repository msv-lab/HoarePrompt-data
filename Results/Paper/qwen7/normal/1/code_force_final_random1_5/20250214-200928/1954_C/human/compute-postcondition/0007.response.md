Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]`.
2. **Analyze the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `i`: The loop index.
   - `len(a)`: The length of the list `a`.
   - `a[i]`: The element at index `i` in the list `a`.
   - `b[i]`: The element at index `i` in the list `b`.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is a string of digits from '1' to '9'.
   - `y` is a string of digits from '1' to '9'.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting each character in the string `x` to an integer.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each character in the string `y` to an integer.
   - `new` is a list of length equal to `a` filled with `None` values.
   - `new2` is a list of length equal to `a` filled with `None` values.

4. **Check the loop condition with the current state**:
   - Since `i` is 0, we need to check if `a[0] == b[0]`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]` for the loop to execute the first time.

Given the current state, the only relevant variables for the loop condition are `a[0]` and `b[0]`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`**
