Output State: **`A` is False, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 1, `not_c` is False, the current value of `set_[i]` is 1, the current value of `set_[i - 1]` is 1, and the condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` is false**

Explanation: The line `not_c = False` changes the value of `not_c` from `True` to `False`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
