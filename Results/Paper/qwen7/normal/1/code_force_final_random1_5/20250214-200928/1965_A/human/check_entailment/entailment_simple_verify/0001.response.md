### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Reading Input:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
- It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

#### Calling the Function:
- The program calls the function `func_1(arr)` to determine the winner.
- This part is correct as it passes the necessary data to the function.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
- It checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If true, it directly returns 'Alice'.
- Otherwise, it creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes (`set_`).
- It iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes to check if the difference between consecutive pile sizes is exactly 1.
  - If any difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False`.
  - It toggles the boolean variable `A` for each iteration.
- After the loop, it checks the value of `A` and returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise returns 'Bob'.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - If the smallest pile has more than one stone, Alice wins immediately. This condition is correctly handled.

2. **Game State Analysis:**
   - The function checks if the pile sizes form a sequence where each pile size is exactly one more than the previous one.
   - This is a key observation because if the pile sizes form such a sequence, the game state can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes).
   - In this specific implementation, the function essentially checks if the sequence is strictly increasing by 1, which is a simplified version of the Nim-sum analysis.

3. **Toggling Logic:**
   - The logic of toggling `A` for each pile size in the sequence is a way to simulate the Nim-sum analysis.
   - If the sequence is strictly increasing by 1, the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, and the player whose turn it is loses if the opponent played optimally.
   - The function correctly simulates this by toggling `A` and returning the result based on the final value of `A`.

However, there are some issues with the logic and the implementation:

- **Incorrect Handling of Pile Sizes:**
  - The function only considers the unique sorted pile sizes, which might not capture the full game state. For example, if the piles are `[1, 2, 3, 5]`, the function will incorrectly return 'Alice' because it only checks the unique sorted values `[1, 2, 3]` and does not consider the presence of a pile of size 5.
  
- **Toggling Logic:**
  - The toggling logic `A = not A` is used to simulate the Nim-sum, but it does not correctly handle the Nim-sum calculation. The Nim-sum should be calculated as the XOR of all pile sizes, not just the toggling of a boolean variable.

### Example Counter-Example:
Consider the input:
```
3
4
1 2 3 5
2
1 2
3
1 2 3
```

- For the first test case `[1, 2, 3, 5]`, the function will return 'Alice' because it incorrectly assumes the sequence is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- For the second test case `[1, 2]`, the function correctly returns 'Alice'.
- For the third test case `[1, 2, 3]`, the function correctly returns 'Alice'.

The function fails to correctly handle the Nim-sum for the first test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the problem description. It fails to handle the Nim-sum calculation properly and incorrectly returns 'Alice' for some test cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
