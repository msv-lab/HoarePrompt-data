Output State: **`A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 2, `not_c` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `A` was initially `False`. The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to the opposite of its current value. Since `A` was `False`, it becomes `True`. The other variables (`arr[0]`, `set_`, `i`, `not_c`) remain unchanged.
