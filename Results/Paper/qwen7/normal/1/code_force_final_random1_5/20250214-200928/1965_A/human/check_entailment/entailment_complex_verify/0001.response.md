### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Reading Input:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
- It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

#### Calling the Function:
- The program calls the function `func_1(arr)` to determine the winner.
- This part is correct as it passes the necessary data to the function.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
- It checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If true, it directly returns 'Alice'.
- Otherwise, it creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes (`set_`).
- It iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes to check if the difference between consecutive pile sizes is exactly 1.
  - If any difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False`.
  - It toggles the boolean variable `A` for each iteration.
- After the loop, it checks the value of `A` and returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise returns 'Bob'.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - If the smallest pile has more than one stone, Alice wins immediately. This condition is correctly handled.

2. **Game State Analysis:**
   - The function checks if the pile sizes form a sequence where each pile size is exactly one more than the previous one.
   - This is a key observation because if the pile sizes form such a sequence, the game state can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes).
   - In this specific implementation, the function essentially checks if the sequence is strictly increasing by 1, which is a simplified version of the Nim-sum analysis.

3. **Toggling Logic:**
   - The logic of toggling `A` for each pile size in the sequence is a way to simulate the Nim-sum analysis.
   - If the sequence is strictly increasing by 1, the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, and the player whose turn it is loses if the opponent played optimally.
   - The function correctly simulates this by toggling `A` and returning the result based on the final value of `A`.

However, there are a few issues with the provided implementation:

1. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop in the function `func_1` should iterate from `1` to `len(set_) - 1`, but the provided annotation suggests it runs 3 times, which is incorrect. The loop should only run once if the sequence is strictly increasing by 1.

2. **Toggling Logic:**
   - The toggling logic is not correctly implemented. The function should toggle `A` based on the parity of the number of piles, not the differences between consecutive pile sizes.

3. **Final Decision:**
   - The final decision should be based on the Nim-sum of the pile sizes, not just the toggling logic. The function should compute the XOR of all pile sizes and decide the winner based on the result.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly implement the game logic, the function should:
1. Check if the smallest pile has more than one stone.
2. Compute the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes).
3. Determine the winner based on the Nim-sum.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    if arr[0] != 1:
        return 'Alice'
    
    nim_sum = 0
    for pile in arr:
        nim_sum ^= pile
    
    return 'Alice' if nim_sum == 0 else 'Bob'
```

### Conclusion:
The original implementation is incorrect due to the flawed toggling logic and the misunderstanding of the Nim-sum concept. The corrected implementation should use the Nim-sum to determine the winner.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
