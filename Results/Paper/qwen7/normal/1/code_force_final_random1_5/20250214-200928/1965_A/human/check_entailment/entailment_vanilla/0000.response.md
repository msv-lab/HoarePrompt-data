Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Calling the Function:**
   - The program calls the function `func_1(arr)` to determine the winner.
   - This part is correct as it passes the necessary data to the function.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If true, it directly returns 'Alice'.
   - Otherwise, it creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes (`set_`).
   - It iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes to check if the difference between consecutive pile sizes is exactly 1.
     - If any difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False`.
     - It toggles the boolean variable `A` for each iteration.
   - After the loop, it checks the value of `A` and returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise returns 'Bob'.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - If the smallest pile has more than one stone, Alice wins immediately. This condition is correctly handled.

2. **Game State Analysis:**
   - The function checks if the pile sizes form a sequence where each pile size is exactly one more than the previous one.
   - This is a key observation because if the pile sizes form such a sequence, the game state can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes).
   - In this specific implementation, the function essentially checks if the sequence is strictly increasing by 1, which is a simplified version of the Nim-sum analysis.

3. **Toggling Logic:**
   - The logic of toggling `A` for each pile size in the sequence is a way to simulate the Nim-sum analysis.
   - If the sequence is strictly increasing by 1, the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, and the player whose turn it is loses if the opponent played optimally.
   - The function correctly simulates this by toggling `A` and returning the result based on the final value of `A`.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem description. It handles all the conditions and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
