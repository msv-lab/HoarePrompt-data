Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `l` is a map object created from integers split from the second input
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements
   - `test` is False
   - The difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` in `lis` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1 depending on whether `j` is odd or even.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, len(lis)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(lis) - 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within this range.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value within this range.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop is controlled by `j`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **New State:**
   - `t` remains the same (greater than 0)
   - `i` remains the same (1)
   - `n` remains the same (input integer)
   - `l` remains the same (map object created from integers split from the second input)
   - `lis` remains the same (sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements)
   - `test` remains the same (False)
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given the above analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from the second input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is False, `j` is the previous value of `j` + 1**.
