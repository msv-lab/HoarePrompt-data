Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` must be exactly equal to the number of inputs provided, `i` will be `t-1`, `n` will be an input integer for each iteration, `l` will be a map object created from integers split from the respective input for each iteration, `lis` will be a sorted list of unique elements from `l` for each iteration. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, then `test` remains False for all iterations. Otherwise, `test` is True, and the final decision is made based on the last iteration's `lis` list. If the length of `lis` is odd, 'Alice' is printed; if even, 'Bob' is printed.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will hold the total number of inputs processed, `i` will be one less than `t` (since the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`), and the decisions about printing 'Alice' or 'Bob' will be based solely on the last iteration's conditions, as the loop does not retain state across iterations.
