Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, len(set_))`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `len(set_)` is at least 1 because the range function starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `len(set_)`.
   - The variable `i` will take values starting from 1 up to but not including `len(set_)`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `len(set_)` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` will be 1.

Given the initial states:
- `A` is False
- `arr[0]` is 1
- `set_` is [1]
- `not_c` is True

We need to adjust the states of `set_` and `i` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State after adjustment**:
- `set_` must have at least 1 element (it already has 1 element).
- `i` must be 1.

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`A` is False, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 1, `not_c` is True**
