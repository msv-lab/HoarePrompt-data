The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list represents the number of stones in each pile, and the length of the list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive. Each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9, inclusive. The function returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. Since both cases return 'Alice', the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return 'Alice'.
