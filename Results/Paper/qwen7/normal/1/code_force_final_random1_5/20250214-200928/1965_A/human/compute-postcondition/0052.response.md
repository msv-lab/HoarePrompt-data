Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `n` is reassigned the value `int(input())`, `l` is updated to be a map object created from integers split from the second input.**

Explanation: The code `l = map(int, input().split())` takes a new input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and creates a map object `l` from these integers. The original value of `n` is reassigned to the new integer input. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `lis`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
