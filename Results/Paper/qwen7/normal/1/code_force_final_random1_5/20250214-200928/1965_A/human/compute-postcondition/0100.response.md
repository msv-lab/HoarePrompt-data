Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`**.

Explanation: The code `lis = sorted(set(l))` creates a set from the map object `l` to remove duplicate elements, and then sorts the set to create a list `lis`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and `l` remains a map object created from integers split from input. The new variable `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`.
