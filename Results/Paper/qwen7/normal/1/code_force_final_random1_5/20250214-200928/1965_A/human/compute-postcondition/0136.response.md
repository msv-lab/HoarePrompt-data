Based on the initial state provided:

- `test` remains `False`, meaning it was never set to `True` during any operations.
- `i` is `2`.
- `l` is a map object created from integers split from input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements.
- The difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j-1]` in the list `lis` is either greater than 1 or `j` is an odd number.
- `j` is less than `len(lis)`.
- The length of `lis` is odd.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
