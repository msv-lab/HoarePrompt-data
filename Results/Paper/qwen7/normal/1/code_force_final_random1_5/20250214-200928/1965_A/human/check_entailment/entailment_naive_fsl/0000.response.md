Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle all potential cases correctly. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3
2
2 2
2
2 1
2
1 2
```

- Expected Output:
```
Alice
Alice
Alice
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
Alice
Bob
Alice
```

The issue lies in the logic of `func_1`. It incorrectly assumes that if the smallest pile is not 1, Alice wins. This is not always true. For example, in the case where the piles are `[2, 2]`, both players can always reduce the piles to `[1, 1]` and then to `[0, 0]`, resulting in a win for Alice. Similarly, in the case where the piles are `[2, 1]` or `[1, 2]`, the smallest pile being 1 does not necessarily mean Bob wins; Alice can still force a win by reducing the piles appropriately.

A correct implementation would involve using the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles after sorting them. Here is a corrected version:

```python
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

t = int(input())
c = 1
while t > 0:
    n = int(input().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    r = func_1(arr)
    print(r)
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    # Sort the array and compute the XOR of all elements
    arr.sort()
    xor_result = 0
    for pile in arr:
        xor_result ^= pile
    return 'Alice' if xor_result else 'Bob'
```

This corrected version uses the XOR operation to determine the winner, which is the correct strategy for this game.
