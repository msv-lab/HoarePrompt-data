Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from the second input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `test` is False, and `j` is equal to the length of `lis`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will iterate through the entire range defined by `range(1, len(lis))`. Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds an element in `lis` where the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1, and since the loop runs until `j` is equal to the length of `lis`, `j` will eventually become equal to `len(lis)`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `test`) remain in their final states as they were not modified within the loop body.
