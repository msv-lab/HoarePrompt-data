Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is False, the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j-1]` in the list `lis` is either greater than 1 or `j` is an odd number, and `j` is less than `len(lis)`**.

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition because both the if and else parts do not change the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `l`, `lis`, `test`, or the relationship between `lis[j]` and `lis[j-1]` under the given conditions.
