Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object created from integers split from the second input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements.
- `test` is True.
- The difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` in `lis` is greater than 1.
- The current value of `j` is odd.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement will print the string 'Bob' directly, regardless of the values of the other variables and objects mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **Bob**
