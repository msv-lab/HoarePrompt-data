Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `len(lis)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being set to 1 (since the range function in Python starts from the first argument, which is 1 in this case).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(lis)`. Therefore, `j` must be less than the length of `lis`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` should be initialized to 1.
   - `lis` must have at least 2 elements (since `j` starts at 1 and must be less than `len(lis)` for the loop to execute at least once).

Given these points, we need to adjust the states accordingly:

- `j` is already set to 1.
- `lis` must have at least 2 elements.

Therefore, the final state to ensure the loop can execute is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is True**.
