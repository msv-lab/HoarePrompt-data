Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input.**

Explanation: The code `l = map(int, input().split())` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting map object is stored in `l`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
