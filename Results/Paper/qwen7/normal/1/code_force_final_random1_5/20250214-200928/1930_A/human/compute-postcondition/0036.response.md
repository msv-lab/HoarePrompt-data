Output State: **`score` is `score` (which is 0 + the value of `l[i]`) plus the value of `l[i]`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 4` and must be less than `2 * n`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of `l[i]`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 4`, and it must still be less than `2 * n`. The list `l` remains a sorted list of integers, and `n` remains an input integer. The initial state of `score` being `score` (which is 0 + the value of `l[i]`) plus the value of `l[i]` is preserved.
