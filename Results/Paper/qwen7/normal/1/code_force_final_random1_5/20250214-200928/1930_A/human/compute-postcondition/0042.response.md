Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) indicating the number of sub-cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and then 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). For each sub-case, it returns information based on the given inputs.**
