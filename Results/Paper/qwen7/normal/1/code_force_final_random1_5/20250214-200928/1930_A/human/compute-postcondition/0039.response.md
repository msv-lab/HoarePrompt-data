Based on the initial state provided:

- The `score` variable will be the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from index 0 and going up to but not including `2 * n`.
- The list `l` is a sorted list of integers.
- The variable `i` is set to `2 * n` after the loop finishes.
- The variable `n` remains as the input integer it was initialized with.

Let's break down the key points:

1. **List `l`**: It is a sorted list of integers.
2. **Variable `n`**: This is the input integer.
3. **Variable `i`**: After the loop, `i` is set to `2 * n`. This indicates the loop iterates over the even indices of the list `l` up to but not including `2 * n`.

Given these points, the `score` is calculated by summing the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2*n-2) from the list `l`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the sum of these elements.

Output: **the sum of elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2*n-2) from the list `l`**
