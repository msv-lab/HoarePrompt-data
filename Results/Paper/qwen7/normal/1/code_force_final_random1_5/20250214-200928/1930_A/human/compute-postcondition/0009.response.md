Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`.
   - `i` is the next even number, which means it is incremented by 2 from the previous value.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `score` is now `score + l[i]`.

2. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range `0` to `2 * n` with a step of `2`.
   - This means `i` takes values `0, 2, 4, ..., 2 * n - 2`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next even number.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **New Values:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 2 from its current value.
   - `n` remains unchanged as long as it is greater than 0.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `i` will be the next even number, which means if the current `i` was `x`, the next `i` will be `x + 2`.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can denote it as `i_current`. Therefore, the next `i` will be `i_current + 2`.

**Final Answer:**

State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`, `i` is the next even number (`i + 2`), `n` must be greater than 0, and `score` is now `score + l[i]`.** 

This translates to: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i_current + 2]`, `i` is `i_current + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `score` is now `score + l[i_current + 2]`.**
