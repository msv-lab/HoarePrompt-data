You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        score = 0
        
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        
        print(score)
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `score` will be the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element, up to the 2*n-1th index if `n` is within the bounds of the list length. After all iterations, the list `l` remains a sorted list of integers entered by the user, and `n` is the integer input that determines the number of pairs of elements to sum. The variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n` after the loop finishes.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the final `score` will be the sum of all elements in `l` that are at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2*n-2), provided that `n` is large enough to ensure at least `len(l)//2` iterations. If `n` is smaller than necessary, the loop will terminate early, but the final `score` will still be the sum of the even-indexed elements up to the point where the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. This process is repeated `n` times until all integers are used.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the elements at even indices (i.e., `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, ...).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the list ensures that we always pick the smallest available numbers to maximize the score.
   - Summing the elements at even indices effectively pairs the smallest numbers together, ensuring that the minimum of each pair is maximized.
   - This approach guarantees that the score is maximized because the smallest numbers are paired together, which is optimal for this problem.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the general case correctly.
   - It works for any valid input within the constraints provided (e.g., `1 <= t <= 5000`, `1 <= n <= 50`, `1 <= a_i <= 10^7`).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score by always pairing the smallest available numbers.

### Correctness:
**True**
