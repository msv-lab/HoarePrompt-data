Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum final score as per the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the List**: For each test case, it reads `2n` integers, sorts them, and then iterates through the sorted list in pairs.
3. **Calculating Score**: During the iteration, it adds the first element of each pair (which is the smaller element due to sorting) to the score. This ensures that the minimum of the two chosen numbers is always added to the score.
4. **Outputting Result**: Finally, it prints the calculated score for each test case.

This approach guarantees that the score is maximized because by sorting the numbers and pairing them in ascending order, the smallest available numbers are always used first, which is optimal for maximizing the sum of the minimums. Therefore, the given program is correct.
