Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`. This means `i` will take values from 0 to \(2 * n - 2\) in steps of 2.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than \(2 * n\).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was an even number (e.g., 0, 2, 4, etc.).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 again.
   - Therefore, `i` will be the next even number after the previous `i`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The condition `i < 2 * n` must still hold true.
   - Given that `n` must be greater than 0, let's assume `n` is some positive integer (e.g., `n = 2` for simplicity).

6. **Calculate the new state**:
   - Suppose at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2 (since it's an even number and `n` is at least 2).
   - The next value of `i` will be 4.
   - The condition `i < 2 * n` should still hold true. If `n = 2`, then `2 * n = 4`, and `i = 4` satisfies this condition.

7. **Update the state**:
   - `score` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it.
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0.**
