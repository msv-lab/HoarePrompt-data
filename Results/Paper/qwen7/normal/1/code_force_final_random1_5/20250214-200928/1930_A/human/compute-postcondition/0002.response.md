Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code takes an input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and sorts the resulting list. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The new variable `l` is created and assigned a sorted list of integers based on the input.
