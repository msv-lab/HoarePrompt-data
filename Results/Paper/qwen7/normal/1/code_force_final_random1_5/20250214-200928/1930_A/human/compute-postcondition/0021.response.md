Output State: **`score` is `l[0] + l[3]`, `l` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `score` is updated to `l[0] + l[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `l` is still a sorted list of integers entered by the user, `n` must still be greater than 0, and `i` remains 3.
