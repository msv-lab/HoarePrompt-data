Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` starts from 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < 2 * n`. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 2 each time, the loop will continue until `i` reaches or exceeds `2 * n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because if `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `i` should be set to its starting value, which is 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (must be greater than 0) and `i` (must be 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`score` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
