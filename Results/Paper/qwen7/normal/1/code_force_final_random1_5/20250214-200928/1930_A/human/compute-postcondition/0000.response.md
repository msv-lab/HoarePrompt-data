Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This means that `int(input())` will read an integer from the input, and this integer should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value within the specified range. Since `t` is given as the initial state, we need to ensure that the input matches the range of `t`.

4. **Adjust the state**: The state before the loop starts is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). To ensure the loop can execute, the input must match this condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` itself, ensuring that the input matches the range of `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
