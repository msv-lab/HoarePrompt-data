Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < 2 * n` and `i` increments by 2 in each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `score` is `score` (which is 0 + the value of `l[i]`) plus the value of `l[i]`.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `i` is `i + 2` and must be less than `2 * n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i + 2`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 2 again, so `i` becomes `i + 4`.
   - The condition `i < 2 * n` must still hold true.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `score` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no new values are added to `score`.
   - `l` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` is updated to `i + 4`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`score` is `score` (which is 0 + the value of `l[i]`) plus the value of `l[i]`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 4` and must be less than `2 * n`, `n` is an input integer**.
