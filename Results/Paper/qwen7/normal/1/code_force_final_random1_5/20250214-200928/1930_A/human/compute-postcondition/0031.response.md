Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`.

2. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.
   - The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration (`i += 2`).

3. **Initial state of the loop**:
   - `score` is 0 (not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
   - `i` is set to `2 * n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be less than `2 * n` initially.
   - Since `i` is set to `2 * n`, the loop will not execute because `i` is not less than `2 * n`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `i` should be set to a value less than `2 * n`.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than `2 * n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`score` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `i` must be less than `2 * n`, `n` is an input integer**
