Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `score` is `l[0]`
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` values starting from 0 up to `2 * n - 2` in steps of 2. So, the loop will continue as long as `i < 2 * n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2 (since the step size is 2).
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `score` remains `l[0]`
   - `l` remains a sorted list of integers entered by the user
   - `n` remains greater than 0
   - `i` is now 3

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`score` is `l[0]`, `l` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3**
