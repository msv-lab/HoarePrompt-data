Postcondition: `aOnes` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `bOnes` is 0, `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, and `bOnes` is not less than `aOnes`.
