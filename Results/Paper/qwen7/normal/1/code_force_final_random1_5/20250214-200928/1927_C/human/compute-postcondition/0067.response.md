Postcondition: **`aOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `a` that are also in list `b` and do not exceed `newk` in count; `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces; `i` is equal to `k + 1`. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, the function continues as normal. Otherwise, the function also continues as normal.**
