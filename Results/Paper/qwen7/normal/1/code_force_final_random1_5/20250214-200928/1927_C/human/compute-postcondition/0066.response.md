Based on the initial state provided:

- `aOnes` is the number of elements in list `a` that are also in list `b` and do not exceed `newk` in count.
- `bOnes` is the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces.
- `i` is equal to `k + 1`.
- Either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

The print statement is `print('no')`.

Given this information, the print statement directly outputs the string `'no'` without any dependence on the values of `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, or `k`.

Output: **no**
