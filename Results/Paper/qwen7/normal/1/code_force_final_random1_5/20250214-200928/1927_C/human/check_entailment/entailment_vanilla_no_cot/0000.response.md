Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to check if it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included. Here are the issues:

1. **Logic for Choosing Elements**: The current logic only checks if an element \(i\) exists in either `a` or `b` and increments the count (`aOnes` or `bOnes`) accordingly. However, it does not ensure that the chosen elements cover all numbers from 1 to \(k\).

2. **Break Condition**: The loop breaks when an element \(i\) is found in neither `a` nor `b`, which is incorrect because we need to check all elements from 1 to \(k\), not just until we find one missing.

3. **Counting Elements**: The counts `aOnes` and `bOnes` do not necessarily reflect the correct distribution of elements needed to cover all numbers from 1 to \(k\).

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to use a more systematic approach, such as using sets to track the presence of numbers and ensuring that all numbers from 1 to \(k\) are covered. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = set(map(int, input().split()))
        b = set(map(int, input().split()))
        needed = set(range(1, k + 1))
        
        # Check if all numbers from 1 to k are present in either a or b
        if needed.issubset(a | b):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution uses sets to efficiently check if all numbers from 1 to \(k\) are present in either array `a` or `b`. If they are, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
