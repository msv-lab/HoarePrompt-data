Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m). a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], and b is a list of m integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6]. The sum of n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
        elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `aOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `a` that are also in list `b` and do not exceed `newk` in count; `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces; `i` is equal to `k + 1`. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, the function continues as normal. Otherwise, the function also continues as normal.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `t` is `t + n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, and `i` is `k + 1`. Additionally, the condition `aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk` is either satisfied or not satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the first integer greater than `k`, `aOnes` is the total count of elements in `a` that are also in the range from 1 to `k` inclusive, adjusted according to the rules within the loop, `bOnes` is the total count of elements in `b` that are also in the range from 1 to `k` inclusive, adjusted according to the rules within the loop, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the last value it was set to before the loop exited, `newk` is `k // 2`. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, then `i` is the first integer greater than `k`. Otherwise, `i` is still greater than `k`, and either `aOnes` does not equal `newk` or `bOnes` does not equal `newk`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
