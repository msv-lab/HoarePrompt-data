Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `aOnes` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1 depending on the presence of `i` in `a` and its count, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 depending on the presence of `i` in `b` and its count, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is at least 2, `newk` is `k // 2`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 3, `aOnes` is either 1 or 2 depending on the presence of `i` in `a` and its count, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the presence of `i` in `b` and its count.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 4, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is set to 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is set to 1. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then either `aOnes` is incremented by 1 or the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If neither of these conditions is met, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
