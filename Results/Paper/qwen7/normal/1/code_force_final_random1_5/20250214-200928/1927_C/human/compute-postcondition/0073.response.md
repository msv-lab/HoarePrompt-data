Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `t` is updated to `t + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `bOnes` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `bOnes = 0` assigns the value 0 to `bOnes`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
