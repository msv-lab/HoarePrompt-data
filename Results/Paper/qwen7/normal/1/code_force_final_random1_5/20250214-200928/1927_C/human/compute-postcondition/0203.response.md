Postcondition: **`i` is the first integer greater than `k`, `aOnes` is the total count of elements in `a` that are also in the range from 1 to `k` inclusive, adjusted according to the rules within the loop, `bOnes` is the total count of elements in `b` that are also in the range from 1 to `k` inclusive, adjusted according to the rules within the loop, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the last value it was set to before the loop exited, `newk` is `k // 2`. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, then `i` is the first integer greater than `k`. Otherwise, `i` is still greater than `k`, and either `aOnes` does not equal `newk` or `bOnes` does not equal `newk`.**
