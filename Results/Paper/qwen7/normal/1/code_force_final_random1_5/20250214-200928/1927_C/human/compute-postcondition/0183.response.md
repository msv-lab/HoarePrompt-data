Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3; `aOnes` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `aOnes` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or any other value). Since no initial value for `aOnes` is given, we assume it starts at 0. After executing `aOnes += 1`, `aOnes` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
