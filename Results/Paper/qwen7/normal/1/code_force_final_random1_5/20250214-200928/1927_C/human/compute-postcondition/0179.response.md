Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `aOnes` is either 1 or 2 depending on the presence of `i` in `a` and its count, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 depending on the presence of `i` in `b` and its count, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is at least 2, `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is set to 1.**
