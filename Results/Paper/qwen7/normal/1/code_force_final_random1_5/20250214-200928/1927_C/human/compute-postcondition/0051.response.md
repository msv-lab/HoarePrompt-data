Postcondition: `aOnes` is 3 if `i` is in both `a` and `b` and the number of ones in `a` is less than or equal to `newk`; otherwise, `aOnes` is 2. `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 if `aOnes < bOnes`, otherwise `bOnes` is 1. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces. `i` must be less than `k`.
