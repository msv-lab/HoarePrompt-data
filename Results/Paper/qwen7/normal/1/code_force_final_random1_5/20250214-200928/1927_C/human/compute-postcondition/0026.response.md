Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `bOnes` is 1, `i` is 1, `i` is in `b`, and the current value of `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`.**

Explanation: The variable `bOnes` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
