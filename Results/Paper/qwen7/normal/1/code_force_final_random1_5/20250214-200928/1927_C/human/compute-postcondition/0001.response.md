Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string into three integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not used or modified in the code. The new variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the first, second, and third integers from the input string, respectively.
