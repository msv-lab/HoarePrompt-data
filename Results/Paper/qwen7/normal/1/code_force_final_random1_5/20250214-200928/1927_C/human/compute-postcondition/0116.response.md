To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the given states.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while i <= k:
```
This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

### Given States
- `aOnes` is either 0 or 1.
- `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count.
- `t` is `t + 1`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`.
2. **Current State of `i`**: After the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.
3. **Required Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still satisfy `i <= k`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the only way for the loop to continue is if `i` was exactly `k` before the increment. Therefore, `i` must be `k` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Adjusted States
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`. It must be set to `k` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer
State: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is `k`**.
