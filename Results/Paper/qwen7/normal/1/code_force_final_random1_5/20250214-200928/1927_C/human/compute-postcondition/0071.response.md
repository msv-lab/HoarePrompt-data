Output State: **`aOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `a` that are also in list `b` and do not exceed `newk` in count; `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` is updated to `t + 1`; `a` is now a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces; `i` is equal to `k + 1`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`; `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
