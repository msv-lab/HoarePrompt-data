Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `k` is greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then either `bOnes` is incremented by 1 or the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk` is not met, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
