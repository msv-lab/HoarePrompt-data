The only variables in the loop head are `_` (which is a dummy variable), `t`, and `n`. Since the dummy variable `_` does not affect the loop condition, we only need to consider `t` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `n` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be greater than 0 for the next iteration unless the loop body changes its value. However, since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes are made to `t`.

Therefore, the state remains the same as the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**
