The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer**
