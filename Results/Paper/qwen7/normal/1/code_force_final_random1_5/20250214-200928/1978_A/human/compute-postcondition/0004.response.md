Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0. This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
   - `n` is an input integer. This is also not used in the code snippet.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. Since the exact input string is not provided, we cannot determine the exact contents of `nums`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
   ```
   - `nums[:-1]` refers to all elements of `nums` except the last one.
   - `max(nums[:-1])` finds the maximum value among these elements.
   - `nums[-1]` refers to the last element of `nums`.
   - The expression `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` adds the maximum value from the first `n-1` elements to the last element of `nums`.

Given the above, since the exact contents of `nums` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `nums`.

Output: **max_value + last_element (where max_value is the maximum value among the first n-1 elements of nums and last_element is the last element of nums)**
