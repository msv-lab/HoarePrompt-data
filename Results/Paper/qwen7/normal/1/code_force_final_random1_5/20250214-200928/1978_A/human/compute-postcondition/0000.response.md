Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the input integer; no other variables are defined.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, the value of `t` is updated to the input integer within this range. No other variables are defined or affected by this code snippet.
