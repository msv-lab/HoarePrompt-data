Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, and `n` is assigned the value of the input integer.**

In this case, the code simply assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` and `nums` remains unchanged, and the newly assigned value of `n` is included in the output state.
