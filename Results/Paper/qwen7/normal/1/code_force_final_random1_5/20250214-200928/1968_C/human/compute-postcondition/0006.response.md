Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the index `i-1` is 0. Therefore, `a[1]` is set to `a[0] + x[0]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
