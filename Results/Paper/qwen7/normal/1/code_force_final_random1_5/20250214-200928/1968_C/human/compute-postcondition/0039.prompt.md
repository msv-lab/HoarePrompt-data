Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n+1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is now a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a[0]` is 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is in the range 1 to n-1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for the first element which is 1000, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is in the range 2 to n, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 1000 and the rest elements being 0, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element is 1000, the second element is 0, and the third element is `1000 + x[0]`, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
