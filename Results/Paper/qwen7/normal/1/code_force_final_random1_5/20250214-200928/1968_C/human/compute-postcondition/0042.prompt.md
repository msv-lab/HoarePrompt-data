Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 1000
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`, `a[i]` is the sum of `a[0] + x[0] + a[1] + x[1] + ... + a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `n` must be greater than or equal to itself, which is always true. The list `a` will have its last element updated to be the cumulative sum of the first element (which is initially 1000) plus the sum of all elements in the list `x` up to the second-to-last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is calculated as `a[0] + sum(x[0] to x[i-1])`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has run for every index from 1 to `n-1`. The list `a` will have been updated such that each element `a[i]` (starting from index 0) is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`, starting from `x[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list `x` (i.e., `a[i] = 1000 + sum(x[:i])`), `x` is a list of integers entered by the user.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. The list `a` will start with 1000 and each subsequent element will be the cumulative sum of the first element (1000) and all the elements in `x` up to that point.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
