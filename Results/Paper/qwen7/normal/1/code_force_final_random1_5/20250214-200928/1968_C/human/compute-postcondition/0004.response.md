Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element being 1000.**

Explanation: The code sets `a[0]` to 1000. Since `a` was initially a list of `n` zeros, after executing `a[0] = 1000`, the first element of `a` is now 1000, while the rest remain zeros. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
