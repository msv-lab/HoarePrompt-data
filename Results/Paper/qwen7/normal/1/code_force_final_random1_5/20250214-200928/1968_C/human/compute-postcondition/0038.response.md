Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element is 1000, the second element is 0, and the third element is `1000 + x[0]`, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`, which is 0, and `x[i - 1]` is `x[2]`. Therefore, `a[3]` (which is `a[i]`) becomes `0 + x[0]`, making `a[3]` equal to `1000 + x[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
