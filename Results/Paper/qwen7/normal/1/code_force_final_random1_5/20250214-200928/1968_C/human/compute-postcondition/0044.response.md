Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a list \( x \) of \( n-1 \) integers (1 ≤ \( x_i \) ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n). For each test case, it calculates a list \( a \) of length \( n \) where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list \( x \). The function then prints the elements of the list \( a \) for each test case.**
