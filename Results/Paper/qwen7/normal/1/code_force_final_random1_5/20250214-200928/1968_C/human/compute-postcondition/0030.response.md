Output State: **`i` is `n+1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is calculated as `a[0] + sum(x[0] to x[i-1])`, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `x`. The initial values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is defined based on its previous definition, which depends on the value of `x`. Since the exact values of `x` are not known until the user inputs them, the state of `a` remains as previously defined, awaiting the input to fully determine its elements.
