Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is a placeholder used to iterate over the range of values returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a non-zero value. Since `_` is just a placeholder, the actual value of `int(input())` determines whether the loop runs or not.

3. **Determine the initial state of the input**: We know from the problem statement that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `int(input())` will return a value between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `int(input())` to a non-zero value. Given the constraints, the smallest possible value is 1.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `int(input())` will return a non-zero value (at least 1).

**State:**
**`int(input())` must return a non-zero value (at least 1)**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
