Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`, `a[i]` is the sum of `a[0] + x[0] + a[1] + x[1] + ... + a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `n` must be greater than or equal to itself, which is always true. The list `a` will have its last element updated to be the cumulative sum of the first element (which is initially 1000) plus the sum of all elements in the list `x` up to the second-to-last element.
