Output State: **`i` is in the range 2 to n, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 1000 and the rest elements being 0, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Since `i` is in the range 2 to n, the first element of `a` (which is `a[1]`) is already set to 1000. For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `i` starts from 2), its value is calculated as the sum of the previous element `a[i - 1]` and the corresponding element from the list `x` (i.e., `x[i - 1]`). All other variables remain unchanged.
