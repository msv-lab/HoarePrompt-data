Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Array Initialization**: The program initializes the array `a` with zeros and sets the first element `a[0]` to 1000. This is a reasonable starting point since it ensures that the modulo operation will yield the required `x_i` values.

3. **Array Filling**: The loop correctly fills the array `a` such that `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true for all `2 \le i \le n`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the array `a` for each test case, which is the required output format.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, let's verify if the program meets the requirements:

- The program handles multiple test cases correctly.
- It initializes the first element of `a` to 1000, ensuring that the modulo operation works as expected.
- The loop correctly computes each subsequent element of `a` based on the previous element and the corresponding `x_i` value.
- The output format matches the problem requirements.

Since the program logic aligns with the problem description and constraints, and it correctly generates an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
