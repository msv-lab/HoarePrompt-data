Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer using map and int functions.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in `x`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was an input integer before the code execution.
