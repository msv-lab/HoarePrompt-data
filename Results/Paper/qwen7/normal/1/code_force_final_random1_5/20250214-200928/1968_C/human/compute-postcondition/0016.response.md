Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a[i]` is the sum of `a[0] + x[0] + a[1] + x[1] + ... + a[n-2] + x[n-2]`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from input and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `x`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The description of `a[i]` remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
