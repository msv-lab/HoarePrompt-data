Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list `x`, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The list `a` will have its first element as 1000, and each of the remaining elements will be the cumulative sum of the first element (1000) and the corresponding elements from the list `x`.
