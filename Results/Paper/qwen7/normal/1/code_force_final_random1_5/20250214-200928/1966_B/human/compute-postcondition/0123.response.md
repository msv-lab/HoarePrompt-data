Output State: **`i` is `n + n`, `n` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `True`, `j` is `m-2`.**

Explanation: The line `impossible = True` sets the variable `impossible` to `True`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions. The value of `i` is `n + n`, `n` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list with `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `ans` is 'YES' (changed to 'NO' because `impossible` is now `True`), `impossible` is `True`, and `j` is `m-2`.
