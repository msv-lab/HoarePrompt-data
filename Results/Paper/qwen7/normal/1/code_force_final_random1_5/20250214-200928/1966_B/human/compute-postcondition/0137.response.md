Output State: **`impossible` remains `False`, `ans` remains `'NO'`, `i` remains `n + n`, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` must be greater than 2, and if `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, the condition is satisfied.**

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `impossible` will still be `False`, `ans` will still be `'NO'`, `i` will still be `n + n`, `gr` will remain as a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `j` will still be `m - 2`, `m` must still be greater than 2, and the condition inside the loop (either the first element of `gr[0]` is not equal to the second element of `gr[0]` or the last element of `gr[n-1]` is not equal to the second last element of `gr[n-1]`) must have been satisfied for at least one iteration of the loop.
