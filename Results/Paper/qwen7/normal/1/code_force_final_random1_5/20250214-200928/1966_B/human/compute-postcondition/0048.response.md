Postcondition: `impossible` is False, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` holds true. If the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` is satisfied, then no changes are made to `impossible`, `ans`, `n`, or `i`.
