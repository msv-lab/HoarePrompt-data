Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` and constructs the grid `gr`.
3. The program checks if the top-left cell (`gr[0][0]`) is the same as the bottom-right cell (`gr[n-1][m-1]`). If they are different, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
4. It then checks if the entire first row or the entire last column can be uniform without changing the top-left and bottom-right cells. This is done by checking if all elements in the first row or the last column are the same as the corresponding elements in the top-left and bottom-right cells.
5. If the first row or the last column cannot be uniform without changing the top-left and bottom-right cells, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
6. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic implemented in the function appears to be correct. The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the given operations.

Correctness: **True**
