Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` must be at least 2.
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user.
- `ans` is `'NO'`.
- `impossible` is `True`.
- `j` is `m - 2`, where `m` must be greater than 2.
- The conditions `(gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]) or (gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1])` and `(gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1])` remain satisfied.

The print statement is `print(ans)`. Since `ans` is explicitly given as `'NO'`, this is what will be printed.

Output: **'NO'**
