Postcondition: `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `impossible` is set to `True` if either the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr`, or the first element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `False`.
