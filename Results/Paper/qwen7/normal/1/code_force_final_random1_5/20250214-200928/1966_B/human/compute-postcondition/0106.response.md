Output State: **`impossible` is `True`, `j` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than 1, `n` is at least 2, `ans` is 'NO'**

The code simply assigns the string `'NO'` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `impossible`, `j`, `m`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
