Postcondition: **`impossible` remains `False`, `ans` remains `'NO'`, `i` remains `n + n`, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` must be greater than 2, and the condition `(gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]) or (gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1])` is satisfied.**
