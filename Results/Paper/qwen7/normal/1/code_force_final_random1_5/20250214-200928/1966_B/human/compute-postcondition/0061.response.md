The code `gr.append(input())` appends the input value to the list `gr`. Initially, `gr` is an empty list. After executing this line of code, `gr` will contain one element, which is the input string. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing one element (an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and 'YES' otherwise, `impossible` is True if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]' holds for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`, `n` must be a positive integer**
