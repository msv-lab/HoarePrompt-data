Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 0 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `n` is an integer from the input split (remains unchanged).
   - `m` is an integer from the input split (remains unchanged).
   - `gr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the input string and the second element is the new input string (remains unchanged).
   - `i` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is determined by the input and not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`tc` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` is an integer from the input split, `gr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the input string and the second element is the new input string, `i` is 2**
