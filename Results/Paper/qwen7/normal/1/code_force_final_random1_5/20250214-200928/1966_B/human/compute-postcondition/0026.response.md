Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j < m - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `impossible` is True if either the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr`, or the first element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains False.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it `j = 2`.
   - The value of `m` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
   - The condition for `impossible` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted, and no operations affect `impossible`.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `j` is now 2.
   - `m` must still be greater than 0.
   - `impossible` retains its previous value based on the conditions mentioned.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, and `impossible` is True if either the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr`, or the first element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains False.**
