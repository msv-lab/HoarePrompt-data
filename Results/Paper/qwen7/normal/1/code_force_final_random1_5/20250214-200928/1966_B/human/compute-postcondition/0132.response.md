Postcondition: **`impossible` remains `False`, `ans` remains 'NO', `i` remains `n + n`, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `j` remains `m - 1`, `m` must be greater than 2, and if `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, the condition is satisfied.**
