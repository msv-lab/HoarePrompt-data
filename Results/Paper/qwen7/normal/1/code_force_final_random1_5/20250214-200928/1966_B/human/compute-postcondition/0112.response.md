Output State: **`tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input string), `i` is `n+1`, `ans` is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the value of `impossible`, `impossible` remains `False`, `j` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than 1, and `n` is at least 2; `n` is updated to the value of the first integer input, `m` is updated to the value of the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
