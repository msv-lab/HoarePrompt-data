Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `impossible` is False
   - `ans` is 'NO'
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `i` must be 0
   - Either the first element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the first element of `gr[i + 1]`, or the last element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the last element of `gr[i + 1]`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` must be 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `n - 1`. Given that `i` becomes 1, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i < n - 1` implies `1 < n - 1`).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Other States Remain Unchanged**:
   - `impossible` remains False.
   - `ans` remains 'NO'.
   - The condition about the elements of `gr` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop incrementing `i`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`impossible` is False, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1**
