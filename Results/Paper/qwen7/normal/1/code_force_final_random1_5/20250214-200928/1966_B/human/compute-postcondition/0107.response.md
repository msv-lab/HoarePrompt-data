Postcondition: ***`impossible` remains `False`, `j` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than 1, and `n` is at least 2. If `impossible` is `True`, then `ans` is set to 'NO'.***

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether `impossible` is `True` or `False`, the variables `j`, `m`, and `n` retain their original states. If `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is set to 'NO'.
