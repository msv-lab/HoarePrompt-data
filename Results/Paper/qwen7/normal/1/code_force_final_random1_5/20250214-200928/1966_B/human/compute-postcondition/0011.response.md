Output State: `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` is an integer from the input split, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string from the loop's `append` method, `i` is `n-1`.

In this final output state, the variable `tc` remains 0 because there is no code in the loop that changes its value. The variable `n` retains its initial value as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `m` also stays unchanged since it is not used or modified inside the loop. The list `gr` contains exactly `n` elements, with each element being an input string collected during the loop iterations. The variable `i`, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, will be `n-1` after the loop completes all its iterations.
