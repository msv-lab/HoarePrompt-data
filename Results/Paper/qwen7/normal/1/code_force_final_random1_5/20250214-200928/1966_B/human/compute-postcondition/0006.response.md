Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 0 (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `n` is an integer from the input split (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - `m` is an integer from the input split (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input string (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - `i` is 0 (at the end of the previous iteration).

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` starts from 0 in the first iteration and is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`tc` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` is an integer from the input split, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input string, `i` is 1**.
