Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1):
   ```
   The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `i < n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m - 2` and `n` is greater than 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so it becomes `m - 1`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 1, `n - 1` is still valid.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented from `m - 2` to `m - 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration (greater than 1).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `m - 1`.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- The other variables (`impossible`, `j`, `m`, `gr`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

**Final State:**
State: **`impossible` remains `False`, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` is greater than 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is `m - 1`, and either the first element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the first element of `gr[i + 1]`, or the last element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the last element of `gr[i + 1]`**
