Output State: `j` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than 1, and `impossible` is False if either `gr[0][m-2]` is not equal to `gr[0][m-1]` or `gr[n-1][m-2]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains unchanged.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will take the value of `m-2`. The condition `m > 1` ensures that the loop runs at least once. The variable `impossible` will be set to `False` if there is any pair of consecutive elements in the first or last row of `gr` that are not equal, up to the last possible pair (`gr[0][m-2]` with `gr[0][m-1]` and `gr[n-1][m-2]` with `gr[n-1][m-1]`). If no such pairs are found, `impossible` remains `False`.
