Output State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and 'YES' otherwise, `impossible` is True if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]' holds for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`, `n, m = map(int, input().split())` has been executed.**

Explanation: The line `gr = []` creates an empty list `gr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The `n, m = map(int, input().split())` line has already been executed, so its effect is included in the initial state description.
