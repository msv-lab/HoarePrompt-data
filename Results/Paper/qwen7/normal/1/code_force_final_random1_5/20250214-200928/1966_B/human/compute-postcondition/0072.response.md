Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = m - 2` (inclusive). This means `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `m - 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `tc` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input string)
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `ans` is 'YES'
- `impossible` is False

We need to ensure that the loop can execute. For the loop to run, `j` must start at 0 and increment until it reaches `m - 2`. Therefore, the key variables to adjust are `j` and `m`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` should start at 0.
   - `m` must be greater than 1 (since the loop runs up to `m - 2`).

The other variables (`tc`, `n`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, `impossible`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:
**`j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1**
