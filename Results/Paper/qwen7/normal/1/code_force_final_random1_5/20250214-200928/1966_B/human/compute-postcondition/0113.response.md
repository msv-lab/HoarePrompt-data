Output State: **`tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is `n+1`, `ans` is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the value of `impossible`, `impossible` remains `False`, `j` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than 1, and `n` is at least 2.**

Explanation: The code `gr = []` initializes an empty list named `gr`. This changes the value of `gr` from a list containing `n` elements (each element being an input string) to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
