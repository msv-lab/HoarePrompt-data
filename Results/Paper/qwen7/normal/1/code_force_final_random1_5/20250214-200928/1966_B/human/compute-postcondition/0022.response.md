Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < m - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `impossible` is True if either the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr`, or the first element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains False.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop runs as long as `j < m - 1`, for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `impossible` remains the same unless the loop body changes it, but since no such change is mentioned, `impossible` stays as it was.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` is now 1.
   - `m` must still be greater than 0.
   - `impossible` remains True (or False) based on the conditions mentioned.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, and `impossible` is True if either the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr`, or the first element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains False.**
