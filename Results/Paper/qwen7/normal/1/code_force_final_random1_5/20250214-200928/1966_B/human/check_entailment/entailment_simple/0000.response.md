Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and constructs the grid `gr` by reading `n` lines of input.
3. The program checks if the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) cells have the same color. If they don't, it sets `ans` to 'NO' and proceeds to check if the entire row or column can be made uniform.
4. It checks if all cells in the first row and last column are the same. If they are not, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
5. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

However, there are some logical issues in the code:
- The logic to determine if the entire row or column can be made uniform is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the first and last elements of the row or column are the same, which is not sufficient.
- The program should instead check if all elements in a row or column are the same by iterating through the entire row or column.

Given these points, the provided solution does not fully address the problem statement. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
