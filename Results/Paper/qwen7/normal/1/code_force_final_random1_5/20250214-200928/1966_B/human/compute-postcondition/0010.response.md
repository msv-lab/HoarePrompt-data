Output State: `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` is an integer from the input split, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string from the loop's `append` method, `i` is `n-1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `tc` remains 0, `n` and `m` retain their initial values as integers from the input split. The list `gr` contains exactly `n` elements, with each element being a string input collected during the loop's iterations. The variable `i` will have the value `n-1`, indicating the last iteration of the loop.
