Output State: `impossible` is `False`, `j` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than 1, `n` is at least 2, and for every pair of consecutive rows `gr[i]` and `gr[i + 1]` in the list `gr`, either the first elements or the last elements are equal.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `impossible` remains `False` because no pair of consecutive rows in `gr` had differing first or last elements. The value of `j` remains `m-2`, `m` stays greater than 1, and `n` is at least 2, as these variables are not modified within the loop.
