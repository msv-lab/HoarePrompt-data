State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, tc is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for tc in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate from `tc = 0` to `tc < t`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (since `range(t)` starts from 0 and goes up to `t-1`). Additionally, `t` must be within the specified range of 1 to \(10^4\).
3. Inside the loop, `tc` is initialized to 0 before the first iteration begins.

Therefore, the initial state must include that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and `tc` is set to 0.
