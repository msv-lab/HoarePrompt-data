Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list with one element which is an input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends the result of `input()` to the list `gr`. Since `i` is defined as `n + 2` and `n` must be at least 2, these conditions remain unchanged. The `input()` function waits for user input, which is then appended to the list `gr`. Therefore, `gr` now contains one element, which is the user's input.
