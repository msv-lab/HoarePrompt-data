Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: From the given state, `i` is initially set to `n-1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Check the initial state of `i`**: For the loop to start executing, `i` should be within the range `[0, n-1]`. Given that `i` is initially `n-1`, the loop will start with `i = n-1` and then decrement `i` in each iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop starts with `i` being `n-1`, we need to ensure that this initial value allows the loop to execute correctly. The loop will continue as long as `i >= 0`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is `n-1` and `n` is a positive integer (since `i` starts at `n-1` and decrements).

State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and 'YES' otherwise, `impossible` is True if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]' holds for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`, `n` must be a positive integer**
