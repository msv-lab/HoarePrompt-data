Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A` is an integer entered by the user that must be greater than 1.
   - `B` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `C` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `X` is the integer value of `A` divided by 2 using integer division.

2. **Calculation of `X`**:
   - Since `X` is the integer value of `A` divided by 2, it means `X = A // 2`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(X * C + B)`.
   - Substituting `X` with `A // 2`, the expression becomes `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Given the initial state and the formula for `X`, the print statement will output the result of `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B**
