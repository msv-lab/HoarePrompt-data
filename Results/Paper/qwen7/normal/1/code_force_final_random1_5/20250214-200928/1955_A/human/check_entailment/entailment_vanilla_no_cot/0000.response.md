Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func()` correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Variables**: For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` which represent the number of yogurts to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion, respectively.
3. **Comparison and Calculation**:
   - If the price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price for one yogurt (`B * 2`), it is cheaper to buy in pairs. In this case, it calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs by `C`.
   - If the number of yogurts (`A`) is even, it can be divided into pairs, and the total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of pairs by `C`.
   - If the number of yogurts (`A`) is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible and then buys the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

This logic ensures that Maxim spends the minimum amount of money to buy exactly `n` yogurts. The provided examples and the general logic of the code confirm its correctness.
