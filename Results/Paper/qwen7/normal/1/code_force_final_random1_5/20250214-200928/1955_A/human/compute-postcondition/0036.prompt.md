Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
    if B * 2 < C:
        print(A * B)
    elif A % 2 == 0:
        print(int(A * C / 2))
    else:
        X = A // 2
        print(X * C + B)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers entered by the user. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, then the postcondition remains as the precondition. Otherwise, `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and if `A` is an even integer, `A` remains unchanged and `X` is set to `A` divided by 2 using integer division. If `A` is an odd integer, `X` is set to `A` divided by 2 using integer division.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `A` is an integer entered by the user, `B` is an integer entered by the user, `C` is an integer entered by the user, and either `B * 2 < C` is true, in which case the postcondition remains as the initial state, or `X` is `A` // 2 if `A` is even, or `X` is not defined if `A` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `A` is an integer entered by the user that must be greater than 1, `B` is an integer entered by the user, `C` is an integer entered by the user, and `X` is either undefined or the integer value of `A` divided by 2 using integer division.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
