Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The variable `i` starts from 0 in the `range` function.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`. Therefore, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that this value is at least 1. The initial state of `t` (which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) does not directly affect the loop's execution but can influence the input value.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `int(input())` which must be at least 1.

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- `int(input())` must be at least 1

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be at least 1**
