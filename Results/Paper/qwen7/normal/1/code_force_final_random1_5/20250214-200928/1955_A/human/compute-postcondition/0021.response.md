Output: **(A // 2) * C + B**

Explanation:
- `i` is explicitly given as 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `A` is an integer entered by the user.
- `B` is an integer entered by the user.
- `C` is an integer entered by the user.
- `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

The print statement evaluates `X * C + B`, which translates to `(A // 2) * C + B`. Therefore, the output will be the result of this expression.
