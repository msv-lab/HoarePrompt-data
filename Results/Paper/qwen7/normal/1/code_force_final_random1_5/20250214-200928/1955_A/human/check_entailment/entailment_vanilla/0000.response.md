Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case:**
   - The program checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`C`) is less than the cost of buying them at the regular price (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.
     - Otherwise, it checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
       - If `A` is even, it can be divided into pairs, and the total cost is `A * C / 2`.
       - If `A` is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible and then buys the remaining yogurt at the regular price. The cost is calculated as `X * C + B`, where `X` is the number of pairs (`A // 2`).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The logic handles both even and odd numbers of yogurts correctly.
   - It ensures that the minimum cost is calculated by comparing the cost of buying individual yogurts with the cost of buying them in pairs.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Cost of buying 2 yogurts individually: `2 * 5 = 10`
  - Cost of buying 2 yogurts at promotion: `9`
  - Since `9 < 10`, the output is `9`.

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Cost of buying 3 yogurts individually: `3 * 5 = 15`
  - Cost of buying 2 yogurts at promotion and 1 at regular: `9 + 5 = 14`
  - Since `14 < 15`, the output is `14`.

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Cost of buying 3 yogurts individually: `3 * 5 = 15`
  - Cost of buying 2 yogurts at promotion and 1 at regular: `11 + 5 = 16`
  - Since `15 < 16`, the output is `15`.

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Cost of buying 4 yogurts individually: `4 * 5 = 20`
  - Cost of buying 2 yogurts at promotion twice: `11 * 2 = 22`
  - Since `20 < 22`, the output is `20`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
