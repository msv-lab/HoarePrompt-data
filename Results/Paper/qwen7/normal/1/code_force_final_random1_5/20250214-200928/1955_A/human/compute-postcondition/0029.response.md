Output: **int(user_input_C * user_input_A / 2)**

Explanation:
- `i` is explicitly given as 2, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `A` is an integer entered by the user that must be greater than 1.
- `C` is an integer entered by the user.
- `X` is not defined and thus not used.
- The print statement calculates `int(A * C / 2)`, where `A` and `C` are user inputs. Since both `A` and `C` are integers, the expression `A * C / 2` will result in an integer division if both `A` and `C` are even, or a floating-point division followed by an integer conversion if they are not. However, the output format specifies `int()`, ensuring the result is an integer.
