Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0 (though `i` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `A` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `B` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `C` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `B * 2` is greater than `C`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   X = A // 2  # Integer division of A by 2
   print(X * C + B)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `X` is the result of `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.
- The expression `X * C + B` will be evaluated and printed.

Given that `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers entered by the user, the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are unknown. However, we can express the final output in terms of these variables.

So, the output will be:
Output: **(A // 2) * C + B**
