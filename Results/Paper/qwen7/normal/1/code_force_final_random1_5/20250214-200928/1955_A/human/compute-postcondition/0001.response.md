Output State: **`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The initial state had `i` set to 0. The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. Since the input must be at least 1, `A`, `B`, and `C` will be integers greater than or equal to 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
