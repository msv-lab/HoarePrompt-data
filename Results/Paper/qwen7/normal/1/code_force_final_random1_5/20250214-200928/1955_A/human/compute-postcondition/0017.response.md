Output State: **`i` is 1, `A` is an integer entered by the user, `B` is an integer entered by the user, `C` is an integer entered by the user**

Explanation: The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them to integers, assigning them to variables `A`, `B`, and `C` respectively. The variable `i` was initially set to 1 and remains unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, while `A`, `B`, and `C` are now the integers entered by the user.
