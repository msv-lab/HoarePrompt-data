Postcondition: `i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers entered by the user. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, then the postcondition remains as the precondition. Otherwise, `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and if `A` is an even integer, `A` remains unchanged and `X` is set to `A` divided by 2 using integer division. If `A` is an odd integer, `X` is set to `A` divided by 2 using integer division.
