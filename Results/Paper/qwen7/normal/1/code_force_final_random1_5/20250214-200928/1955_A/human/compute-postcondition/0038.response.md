Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). For each test case, it prints one of three values based on specific conditions involving \(A\) and \(B\). Specifically, if \(B \times 2\) is less than \(C\), it prints \(A \times B\); if \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\); otherwise, it calculates \(\frac{A}{2}\) (integer division) and prints the result multiplied by \(C\) plus \(B\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
