Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

1. **Problem Requirements:**
   - If \(B \times 2 < C\), it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at price \(B\). So, the total cost would be \(A \times B\).
   - If \(B \times 2 \geq C\), it's beneficial to buy yogurts in pairs at price \(C\). We need to calculate the minimum cost based on this condition.
     - If \(A\) is even, we can buy all yogurts in pairs, so the total cost is \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\).
     - If \(A\) is odd, we need to buy \(\left\lfloor \frac{A}{2} \right\rfloor\) pairs and one additional yogurt at price \(B\), so the total cost is \(\left\lfloor \frac{A}{2} \right\rfloor \times C + B\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly checks if \(B \times 2 < C\). If true, it prints \(A \times B\).
   - It correctly handles the case when \(A\) is even by printing \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\).
   - However, for the case when \(A\) is odd, it divides \(A\) by 2 using integer division (`A // 2`) and multiplies the result by \(C\), which is correct. But it adds \(B\) directly without considering that only one additional yogurt might be needed, not necessarily \(B\).

3. **Correct Implementation:**
   - For an odd \(A\), the correct calculation should be \(\left\lfloor \frac{A}{2} \right\rfloor \times C + B\).

Given these points, the program is almost correct but has a minor flaw in handling the case when \(A\) is odd. The current implementation will always add \(B\) regardless of whether one additional yogurt is needed or not.

Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
