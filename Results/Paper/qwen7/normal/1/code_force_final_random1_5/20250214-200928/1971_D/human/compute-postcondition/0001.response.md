State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
2. The loop runs based on the value of `t` (which is the upper limit for the range function).
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid integer within the specified range (1 to 500).
4. The variable `i` is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop execution.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is within the required range and `i` is set to 0.
