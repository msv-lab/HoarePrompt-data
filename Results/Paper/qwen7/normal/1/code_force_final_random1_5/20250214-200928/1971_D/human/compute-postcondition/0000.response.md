Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), after executing the code, `t` will retain this property but its specific value will be determined by the user's input. All other variables remain unchanged, specifically, there is no mention of a variable `s` in the initial state, so it remains undefined.
