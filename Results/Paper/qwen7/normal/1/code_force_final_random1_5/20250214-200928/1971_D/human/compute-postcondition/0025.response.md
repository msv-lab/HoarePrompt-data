Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 2, `s` is an input string with length greater than 1, `flag` is True, `j` is 3, `count` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` is 2, so after executing the code, `j` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `flag`, and `count`) remain unchanged.
