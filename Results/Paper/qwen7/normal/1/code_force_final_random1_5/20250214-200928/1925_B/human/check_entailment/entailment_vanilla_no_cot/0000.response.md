Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given Python program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `x` and `n`.

2. **GCD Calculation**: The program iterates through possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`, it checks if splitting the problem into sub-problems of difficulty `i` is feasible (i.e., `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`). If so, it updates the answer.

3. **Second Condition Check**: It also checks the complementary condition where the divisor is `x // i` and ensures that the remaining part is divisible by this divisor.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the maximum balance found.

This approach ensures that the program considers all possible ways to split the problem into `n` sub-problems while maximizing the GCD (balance). The use of the square root optimization is efficient and correct for this problem.
