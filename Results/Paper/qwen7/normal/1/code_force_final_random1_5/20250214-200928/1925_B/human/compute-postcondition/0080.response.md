Output State: **`i` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value (1) and `ans`, `n` is `int(sqrt(x))`, and `x % i == 0`. The current value of `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0, and `(x - n * i) % i` is equal to 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` was initially 1, `ans` will be updated to 1 unless there was a previous value of `ans` that was greater than 1. However, since no previous value of `ans` is given, we assume `ans` starts at 1, and thus remains 1 after this operation. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
