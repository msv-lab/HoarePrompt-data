Output State: **The final value of `ans` will be the maximum value among all possible values of `i` and `x // i` that satisfy the conditions within the loop for all iterations.**

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `ans` will hold the highest value that satisfies one of the two conditions inside the loop for any divisor `i` of `x` up to `int(sqrt(x))`. Specifically, `ans` will be updated if either of these conditions is met for any `i`:

1. `x % i == 0` and `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`
2. `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`

The loop iterates through all divisors of `x` up to `int(sqrt(x))`, checking each one against these conditions. The maximum value found during these checks is stored in `ans`. Therefore, the final value of `ans` will be the largest such value encountered during the loop's execution.
