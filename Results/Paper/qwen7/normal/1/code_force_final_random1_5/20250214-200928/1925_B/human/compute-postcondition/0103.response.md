Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `int(sqrt(x))`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i` if the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is met. Additionally, if the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` is satisfied, `ans` is also updated to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`. `ans` is updated to `x // i` if the conditions are met.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state. The conditions for updating `ans` are still applicable, but whether `ans` is updated depends on the satisfaction of those conditions.
