Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is `int(sqrt(x))`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i` if the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is met. Additionally, if the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` is satisfied, `ans` is also updated to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
