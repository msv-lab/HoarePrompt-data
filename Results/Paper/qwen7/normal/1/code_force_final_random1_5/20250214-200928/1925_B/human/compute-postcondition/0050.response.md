Postcondition: `ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // i`, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` must be an integer or a float that allows the range to include integers from 1 up to and including the integer part of the square root of `x` + 1, and `x % i == 0`. Additionally, if `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0 and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i)` is equal to 0, then `ans` is set to `x // i`; otherwise, `ans` remains as 2.
