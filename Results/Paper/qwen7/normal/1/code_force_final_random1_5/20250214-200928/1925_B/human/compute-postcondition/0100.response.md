Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `int(sqrt(x))`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i` if the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is met, `ans` is also equal to `max(ans, 3)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`, which is 3. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition for updating `ans` is not specified with a value for `x`, so it remains as described.
