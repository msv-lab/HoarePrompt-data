Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`. If the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` is true, then `ans` is updated to `x // i`. If the condition is false, `ans` remains unchanged.
