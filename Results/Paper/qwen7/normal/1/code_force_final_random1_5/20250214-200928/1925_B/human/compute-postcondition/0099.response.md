Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - `n` is `int(sqrt(x))`.
   - `ans` is updated based on certain conditions.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, and it increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after the previous iteration where `i` was 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by `int(sqrt(x))` before the loop starts and does not change within the loop.
   - `ans` might have been updated based on the conditions, but since we don't know the exact value of `x` or the exact conditions under which `ans` was updated, we cannot specify a new value for `ans`. However, we can keep the same condition for `ans`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be 3.
- `n` will remain `int(sqrt(x))`.
- `ans` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `int(sqrt(x))`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i` if the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is met. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.**
