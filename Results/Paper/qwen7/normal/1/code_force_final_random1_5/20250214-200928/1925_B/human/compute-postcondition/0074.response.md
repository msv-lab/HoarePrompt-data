Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value found during the loop execution, `q` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `x` is an input integer, and `n` is an input integer.**

The code `x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively. The values of `ans` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state.
