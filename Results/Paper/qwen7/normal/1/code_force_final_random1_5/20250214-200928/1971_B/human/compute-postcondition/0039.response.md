Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s` is the new string input by the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new string input by the user, `b` is a sorted string of the new string input by the user, `c` is the sorted string of the new string input by the user in descending order. If the length of set `a` is 2, the function does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Otherwise, the values of these variables remain unchanged.**
