You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()

    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `s` is the last input string entered by the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, `b` is a sorted string of `s`, and `c` is the sorted string of `s` in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` followed by `n` strings `s`. For each string `s`, it checks if the number of unique characters is exactly 2. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then either the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` or its reverse, depending on which comes first alphabetically.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking for Unique Characters:**
   - It converts the string `s` into a set `a`, which removes duplicate characters.
   - If the length of the set `a` is 2, it prints 'NO'. This means the string has exactly two unique characters, and thus cannot be rearranged to form a different string.

3. **Generating Rearranged Strings:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is not 2, it prints 'YES'.
   - It sorts the string `s` in both ascending (`b`) and descending (`c`) order.
   - If the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`, it prints the reversed sorted string `c`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string `b`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Handling All Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string has exactly two unique characters, printing 'NO' as required.
   - However, the program does not handle all other cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`. If they are not equal, it prints `b`. This approach is incomplete because it does not ensure that `b` is a different string from `s`.

2. **Example Test Cases:**
   - Consider the string "co". The set `a` will have 2 elements, so it prints 'NO', which is correct.
   - Consider the string "nutdealer". The set `a` will have more than 2 elements, so it prints 'YES'. Sorting "nutdealer" gives "aeelnortud", which is a different string. This is correct.
   - Consider the string "mwistht". The set `a` will have more than 2 elements, so it prints 'YES'. Sorting "mwistht" gives "ehimrstw", which is a different string. This is correct.
   - Consider the string "aaaaa". The set `a` will have 1 element, so it prints 'NO', which is correct.
   - Consider the string "xxxxxxxxx". The set `a` will have 1 element, so it prints 'NO', which is correct.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program fails to handle cases where the string has more than 2 unique characters but can still be rearranged to form a different string. For example, "abc" should print 'YES' and "bac" or "cba" as a valid rearrangement.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly handle all cases where the string can be rearranged to form a different string. It only checks if the sorted string is different, which is insufficient.

### Correctness:

**False**
