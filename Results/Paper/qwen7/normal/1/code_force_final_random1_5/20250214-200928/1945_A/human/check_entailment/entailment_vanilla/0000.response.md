Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which is a common pattern to read from stdin in competitive programming contexts.
   - It skips the first line (`[*open(0)][1:]`), meaning it starts processing from the second line onwards.

2. **Parsing Input**:
   - For each test case, it reads a line and splits it into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

3. **Adjusting Extroverts and Universals**:
   - The line `(a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())` parses the input.
   - The next line `b += c` adds the number of universals to the number of extroverts. This adjustment is done because each extrovert can be paired with a universal to form a group of three.

4. **Calculating Tents**:
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` calculates the number of tents needed.
     - `-b // 3` computes the integer division of `b` by 3, which gives the maximum number of groups of three that can be formed from `b` (extroverts + universals).
     - `a - -b // 3` subtracts this value from `a` (introverts), effectively calculating how many more tents are needed to accommodate the remaining introverts.
   - The expression `(-1, -1)[c < b % 3]` checks if there are any leftover universals that cannot form a complete group of three with extroverts.
     - `b % 3` gives the remainder when `b` is divided by 3.
     - If `c < b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts, making it impossible to accommodate everyone.
     - The ternary operator `(-1, -1)[c < b % 3]` returns `-1` if the condition is true, indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1**: `1 2 3`
  - `a = 1`, `b = 2 + 3 = 5`, `c = 3`
  - `b // 3 = 5 // 3 = 1` (one group of three)
  - Remaining introverts: `1 - 1 = 0`
  - No leftover universals: `3 >= 5 % 3 = 2`
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 2**: `1 4 1`
  - `a = 1`, `b = 4 + 1 = 5`, `c = 1`
  - `b // 3 = 5 // 3 = 1` (one group of three)
  - Remaining introverts: `1 - 1 = 0`
  - Leftover universals: `1 < 5 % 3 = 2`
  - Output: `-1`

- **Test Case 3**: `1 4 2`
  - `a = 1`, `b = 4 + 2 = 6`, `c = 2`
  - `b // 3 = 6 // 3 = 2` (two groups of three)
  - Remaining introverts: `1 - 2 = -1` (not possible, but we should handle it correctly)
  - Leftover universals: `2 >= 6 % 3 = 0`
  - Output: `2`

### Conclusion

The program logic is correct for the given problem constraints and examples. It handles the calculation of tents needed and correctly identifies when it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
