Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `b` is updated to `b + c`.
   - `a` is the first part of the split string of `s`.
   - `c` is the third part of the split string of `s`.
   - `s` is the next line in the input.
   - `b` is now `b + c`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The expression inside the `print` function is a tuple `(a - -b // 3, -1)`.
   - The tuple contains two elements: `a - -b // 3` and `-1`.
   - The expression `c < b % 3` evaluates to either `True` or `False`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the `print` function will print the first element of the tuple, i.e., `a - -b // 3`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the `print` function will print the second element of the tuple, i.e., `-1`.

4. **Determine the Value**:
   - We need to know the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to determine which element of the tuple will be printed.
   - Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we can only describe the condition under which each element will be printed.

5. **Final Output**:
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the output will be `a - -b // 3`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the output will be `-1`.

Given the lack of specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, the most precise description of the output is based on the condition `c < b % 3`.

Output: **a - -b // 3 if c < b % 3, otherwise -1**
