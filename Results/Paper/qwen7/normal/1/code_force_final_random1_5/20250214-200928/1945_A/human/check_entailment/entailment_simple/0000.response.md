### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which is a common pattern to read lines from stdin in Python scripts. It then splits each line into `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, s.split())`.

2. **Modification of Variables**: The program correctly modifies `b` by adding `c` to it, which is necessary because each extrovert and universal can potentially share a tent with another person.

3. **Tent Calculation**:
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is used to calculate the minimum number of tents required.
   - `- -b // 3` simplifies to `b // 3` due to operator precedence, meaning it calculates the number of full tents needed for `b` people (extroverts and universals combined).
   - The condition `c < b % 3` checks if there are more universals than remaining spots in the current set of tents. If true, it prints `-1` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone according to their preferences.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `c >= b % 3`, the number of tents required is `b // 3 + (1 if b % 3 > 0 else 0) + a`.
   - When `c < b % 3`, it directly returns `-1`.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the result for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
