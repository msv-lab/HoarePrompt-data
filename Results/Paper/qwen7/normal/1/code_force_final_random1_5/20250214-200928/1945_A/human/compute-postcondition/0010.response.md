Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is updated to `b + c`, `a` is the first part of the split string of `s`, `c` is the third part of the split string of `s`, `s` is the next line in the input, and `b` is now `b + c`.**

Explanation: The code `b += c` updates the value of `b` to be the sum of its current value and `c`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
