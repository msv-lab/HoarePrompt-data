Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`.
   - `a` is the first part of the split string.
   - `c` is the third part of the split string.
   - `s` is the next line in the input.
   - `b` is updated to `b + c`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The expression inside the `print` function is a tuple `(a - -b // 3, -1)`.
   - The tuple contains two elements: `a - -b // 3` and `-1`.
   - The second element of the tuple is always `-1`.
   - The first element of the tuple, `a - -b // 3`, will be selected based on the condition `c < b % 3`.

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - `b % 3` gives the remainder when `b` is divided by 3.
   - `c < b % 3` checks if `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by 3.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, then the first element of the tuple (`a - -b // 3`) will be selected.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, then the second element of the tuple (`-1`) will be selected.

5. **Value Calculation**:
   - Since `b` is updated to `b + c`, the value of `b` in the expression `a - -b // 3` will be `b + c`.
   - The double negation `- -b` simplifies to `b`, so `a - -b // 3` becomes `a - b // 3`.
   - `b // 3` gives the integer division of `b` by 3, which is the quotient when `b` is divided by 3.

6. **Final Output**:
   - The output will depend on the value of `c` relative to `b % 3`.
   - If `c < b % 3`, the output will be `a - b // 3`.
   - If `c >= b % 3`, the output will be `-1`.

Given the complexity and the need for precise values, the most accurate representation of the output is:

Output: **a - b // 3 if c < b % 3, otherwise -1**
