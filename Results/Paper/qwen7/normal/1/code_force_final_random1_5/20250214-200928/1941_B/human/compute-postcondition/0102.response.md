Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `i` is `n - 1`, `opNum` is `0`, `a` is a list of integers split from the input, `a[i]` is the first element of the list, `a[i + 1]` is the second element of the list, `a[i + 2]` is the third element of the list, either the last element of `a` is not `0` or the second last element of `a` is not `0`, and `_` is `0`.**

Explanation: The variable `stop` is explicitly set to `False`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions regarding the list `a` and the values of its elements still hold true.
