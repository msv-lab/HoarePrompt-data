Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 1`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
