Postcondition: `stop` is `True`, `opNum` is `0`, `a` is a list of integers split from the input, the first element of `a` is less than `0`, `a[i + 1]` is the second element of the list, `a[i + 2]` is the third element of the list, either the last element of `a` is not `0` or the second last element of `a` is not `0`, and `i` must be in the range `[0, n-2]`, `_` is `0`.
