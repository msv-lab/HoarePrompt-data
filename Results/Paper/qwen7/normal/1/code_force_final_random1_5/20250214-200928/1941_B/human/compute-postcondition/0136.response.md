Postcondition: **`stop` is `True`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - (i+1) * opNum`, `a[i+1]` is `a[i+1] - (i+1) * opNum - (i) * opNum`, `a[i+2]` is `a[i+2] - (i+1) * opNum`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `_` is `0`. The loop has executed for all possible iterations (from `i = 0` to `i = n-3`), and since `stop` is set to `True` as soon as any negative value is encountered in `a[i]`, it remains `True`. The operations on `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` continue to decrement these values based on the value of `opNum` which is initially `a[i]` and changes with each iteration.**
