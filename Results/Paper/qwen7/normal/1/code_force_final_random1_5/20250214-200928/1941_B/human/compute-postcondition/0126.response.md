Based on the initial state provided:

- `stop` is `True`.
- `opNum` is `a[i]`.
- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] - 2 * opNum`.
- `a[i + 1]` is updated to `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum`.
- `a[i + 2]` is updated to `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`.
- `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
- `_` is `0`.

The print statement is `print('NO')`.

The print statement does not depend on any of the variables or their updates. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.
