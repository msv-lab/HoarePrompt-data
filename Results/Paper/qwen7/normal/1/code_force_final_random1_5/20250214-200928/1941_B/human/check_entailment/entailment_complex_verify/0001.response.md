### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the given program is incorrect because it only checks the first and last elements without considering the entire array. Let's re-evaluate the problem and propose a correct solution.

#### Correct Solution Analysis

To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that the sum of the array is even and that the array can be reduced to all zeros using the given operations. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Read Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Check Sum of Array:**
   - Calculate the sum of the array. If the sum is odd, it is impossible to make all elements zero, so print 'NO'.
   - If the sum is even, proceed to the next step.

3. **Check Array Elements:**
   - Iterate through the array and check if each element can be reduced to zero using the given operations.
   - Specifically, for each element `a[i]`, check if it can be reduced to zero by repeatedly applying the operation.

4. **Implement the Logic:**
   - If any element cannot be reduced to zero, print 'NO'.
   - If all elements can be reduced to zero, print 'YES'.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even
        if sum(a) % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if all elements can be reduced to zero
        for num in a:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Annotated Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())  # Read the size of the array
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the array elements
        
        # State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` is a list of integers where \(0 \leq a_j \leq 10^9\) for each element \(a_j\) in the array.
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even
        if sum(a) % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')  # If the sum is odd, print 'NO'
            continue
        
        # Check if all elements can be reduced to zero
        for num in a:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                print('NO')  # If any element is odd, print 'NO'
                break
        else:
            print('YES')  # If all elements can be reduced to zero, print 'YES'
        
    # State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` is a list of integers where \(0 \leq a_j \leq 10^9\) for each element \(a_j\) in the array. The number of iterations left is `0`.
```

### Final Evaluation

The corrected program checks if the sum of the array is even and if all elements can be reduced to zero using the given operations. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaw in the given program.

**Final: False**
