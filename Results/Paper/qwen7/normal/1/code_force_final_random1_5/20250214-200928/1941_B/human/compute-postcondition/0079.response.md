Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 2`, `opNum` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is decreased by `opNum`**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `stop` to `True`, which does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
