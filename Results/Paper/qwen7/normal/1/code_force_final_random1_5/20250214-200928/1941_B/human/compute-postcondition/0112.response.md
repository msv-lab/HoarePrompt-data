Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `opNum` is the value of `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is the second element of the list, `a[i + 2]` is the third element of the list, either the last element of `a` is not `0` or the second last element of `a` is not `0`, and `i` must be in the range `[0, n-2]`, `_` is `0**.

Explanation: The code `a[i] -= opNum` subtracts the value of `opNum` from `a[i]`. Since `opNum` is the value of `a[i]`, `a[i]` is effectively being subtracted by itself, resulting in `a[i]` becoming `0`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
