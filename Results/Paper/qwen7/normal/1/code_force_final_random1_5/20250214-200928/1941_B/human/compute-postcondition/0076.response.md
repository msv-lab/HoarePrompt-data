Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is decreased by `opNum`**.

This means that after executing the line `a[i + 2] -= opNum`, the value of `a[i + 2]` has been updated by subtracting `opNum` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
