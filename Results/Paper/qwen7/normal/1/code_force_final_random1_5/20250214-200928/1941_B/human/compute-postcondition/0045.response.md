Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n - 3`
- `opNum` is equal to `a[n - 3]`
- `a[n - 2]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`
- `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `opNum`
- `stop` is `True`
- The last element of `a` is not 0 or the second last element of `a` is not 0.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO' without any additional variables or objects being evaluated or printed.
