Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks the first and last elements of the array to determine if the array can be made zero. This approach is insufficient and does not account for the general case where the array might have multiple elements that need to be reduced to zero.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the sum of all elements in the array is even and that the array can be manipulated according to the given operation rules. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even
        if sum(b) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
3. It calculates the sum of the array.
4. If the sum of the array is even, it prints 'YES' indicating that it is possible to make all elements zero. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

This approach ensures that the array can be reduced to all zeros if and only if the sum of the array is even, which is a necessary condition based on the operation rules provided.
