Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **team**: This is the result of `goalIn(pos)`. Since `pos` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `team`. However, we know it is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **t**: This is an integer greater than 3. We don't know the exact value, but we know it is more than 3.

3. **time**: This is explicitly given as 3.

4. **command**: This is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped. We don't have the actual command, so we cannot determine its contents.

5. **obj**: This is the value of `elements[obj]`. Since `obj` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value.

6. **com**: This is the second element of `command`. Again, without knowing the contents of `command`, we cannot determine the exact value of `com`.

7. **nxt**: This is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. Here, `pos` is not defined, and `mov` is not defined either. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `nxt`.

8. **allPlayers[obj]**: This is explicitly given as `False`.

Given these details, let's focus on the print statement:

```python
print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

- `time` is given as 3.
- `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, but we don't know its exact value.
- `GoalName[team]` refers to the goal name corresponding to the team, but since `team` is unknown, we cannot determine `GoalName[team]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with `time` set to 3 and `GoalName[team]` where `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.

Output: **3 GoalName[team] (where team is the result of goalIn(pos))**
