Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ind` will be equal to the length of `line` minus one.
   - `elements` will contain key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line`.
   - `allPlayers` will be populated with keys for any player identifiers found in `line` set to `False`.
   - `goal` will contain tuples for any goal identifiers found in `line`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Given the above points, let's adjust the states:

- `ind` will still be equal to the length of `line` minus one (since it is not affected by the loop).
- `elements` will still contain key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line` (since it is not affected by the loop).
- `allPlayers` will still be populated with keys for any player identifiers found in `line` set to `False` (since it is not affected by the loop).
- `goal` will still contain tuples for any goal identifiers found in `line` (since it is not affected by the loop).

The only changes needed are for `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ind` is equal to the length of `line` minus one, `elements` contains key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line`, `allPlayers` is populated with keys for any player identifiers found in `line` set to `False`, `goal` contains tuples for any goal identifiers found in `line`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same.**
