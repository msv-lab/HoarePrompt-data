Postcondition: `ind` is now equal to the index of the next character in `line` (which is `ind + 1`), `line` is the same as before, and `elements[line[ind]]` is now equal to `i`. Additionally, if `line[ind]` is not a player (i.e., `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False), then `ind` is increased by 1. If `line[ind]` is a player and `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to False. Furthermore, if `line[ind-1][1]` is 'G', then `elements[line[ind-1]]` is now equal to `i`, `ind` is set to 2, `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', else 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.
