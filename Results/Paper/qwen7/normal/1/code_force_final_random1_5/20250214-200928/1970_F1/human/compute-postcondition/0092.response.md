Output State: **Postcondition: `ind` is now equal to the index of the last character of `line`, `elements` contains key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line`, where each key is an entry in `line` and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. For any entry in `line` that is a goal identifier (i.e., starts with 'G'), `goal[tmp]` (where `tmp` is 0 if the first character is 'B', otherwise 1) will contain a list of tuples `(i, ind)`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `ind` will point to the last index of the `line`.
- The dictionary `elements` will map each non-blank ('.') character in `line` to a tuple containing the iteration number `i` and the index `ind` of that character in `line`.
- If any character in `line` is a player identifier, the corresponding entry in `allPlayers` will be set to `False`.
- Any goal identifiers in `line` will have their positions recorded in the appropriate `goal` list (determined by whether the second character is 'B' or 'G').
