Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped. If the length of `command` is 3, then:
- `obj`, `com`, and `el` are the first, second, and third elements of the `command` list respectively.
- If `el` is '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True.
- If `el` is '.S', then `team` is 0 and `points[team]` is 10.
- In all other cases, the values of `team`, `time`, `obj`, `com`, `el`, and `points[team]` remain unchanged.
Otherwise:
- `obj` is a list with the value `[.B]`.
- `com` is the second element of `command`.
- `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
- `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
- `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.
