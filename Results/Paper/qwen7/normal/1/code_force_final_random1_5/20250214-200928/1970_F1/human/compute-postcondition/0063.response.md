Output State: **`ind` is now `line[ind]`, `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`, the player condition `(isPlayer(line[ind]))` is false, and the current value of `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns `0` to `tmp` if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`, otherwise it assigns `1`. Since `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` (as given by the precondition), `tmp` is assigned the value `0`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
