Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Missing Movement Directions**: The `mov` dictionary is never defined. This dictionary should map movement commands ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') to their corresponding coordinate changes. For example, `mov['U'] = (-1, 0)` would mean moving up one row.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Catching and Throwing**: The logic for catching and throwing the Quaffle is incomplete. Specifically, when a player catches the Quaffle, the code should update the player's state to indicate they are now carrying the Quaffle. Similarly, when a player throws the Quaffle, the Quaffle should be placed at the player's current position.

3. **Incorrect Output Format for Golden Snitch**: The code checks for catching the golden snitch with `if el == '.S'`, but there is no golden snitch in the input format described. The golden snitch is not part of the initial setup and should not be checked for.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Player Elimination**: The code incorrectly handles player elimination. When a player is eliminated, it should be removed from the `allPlayers` dictionary, and the game should stop allowing that player to perform further actions.

5. **Goal Scoring Logic**: The logic for scoring a goal needs to be corrected. When a player places the Quaffle in the opposing team's goal, the score should be updated, and the Quaffle should be moved to the center of the field.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1` with these issues addressed:

```python
from sys import stdin

# Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, stdin.readline().strip().split())
    grid = []
    elements = {'.B': (-1, -1)}
    allPlayers = {}
    goal = [[], []]
    points = [0, 0]

    mov = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}

    for i in range(n):
        line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
        grid.append(line)
        for ind in range(len(line)):
            if line[ind] != '..':
                elements[line[ind]] = (i, ind)
                if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                    allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
                elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                    tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                    goal[tmp].append((i, ind))

    t = int(stdin.readline().strip())
    for time in range(t):
        comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
        if len(comand) == 3:
            (obj, com, el) = comand
            if el == '.Q':
                allPlayers[obj] = True
            elif el == '.S':
                team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
                points[team] += 10
                print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
        else:
            (obj, com) = comand
            pos = elements[obj]
            nxt = (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])
            if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt):
                player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
                print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
                del allPlayers[player]
            elif com == 'C':
                allPlayers[obj] = True
            elif com == 'T':
                allPlayers[obj] = False
                if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                    team = goalIn(pos)
                    print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                    points[team] += 1
                    # Move the Quaffle to the center of the field
                    elements['.Q'] = ((n-1)//2, (m-1)//2)
            elif isPlayer(obj):
                elements[obj] = nxt
            if obj == '.B':
                elements[obj] = nxt

    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))

# Function 2:
def goalIn(pos):
    res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
    return res

# Function 3:
def isPlayer(el):
    res = (el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'
    return res
```

This corrected version should handle the game logic correctly according to the problem description.
