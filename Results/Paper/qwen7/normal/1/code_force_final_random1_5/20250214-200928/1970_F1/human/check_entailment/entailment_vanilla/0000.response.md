### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Initial Setup:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the input and initializes the grid, elements dictionary, players dictionary, goals, and points.
   - The `elements` dictionary maps each entity to its coordinates.
   - The `allPlayers` dictionary keeps track of whether a player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - The `goal` list stores the coordinates of the goals for each team.
   - The `points` list keeps track of the scores for each team.

2. **Reading Input:**
   - The dimensions of the grid (`n`, `m`) are read.
   - The grid is populated with entities.
   - The number of steps (`t`) is read.

3. **Processing Steps:**
   - For each step, the command is read and processed.
     - If the command involves catching or throwing the Quaffle, the appropriate actions are taken.
     - If the command involves moving, the player's new position is updated.
     - The function checks if the player has scored a goal and updates the score accordingly.

4. **Checking Validity:**
   - The function ensures that movements and actions are valid (e.g., a player cannot move out of bounds).
   - The function correctly handles the scoring logic and updates the points accordingly.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the events as they occur.
   - Finally, it prints the final score.

### Analysis:

- The code correctly handles the movement and actions of players and the Quaffle.
- The scoring logic is implemented correctly, ensuring that points are awarded when a player scores in the opponent's goal.
- The elimination logic is handled appropriately, where a player is eliminated if they move into a position occupied by another player.
- The final score is correctly calculated and printed.

### Conclusion:

The given program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
