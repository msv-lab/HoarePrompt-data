Based on the initial state provided:

- `team` is 0
- `time` is 0
- `obj`, `com`, and `el` are the first, second, and third elements of the `command` list respectively
- `points[team]` is 10

The `print` statement is:

```python
print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

Here's the breakdown:

1. `time` is explicitly given as 0.
2. `team` is explicitly given as 0.
3. `GoalName[team]` refers to `GoalName[0]`. Since `GoalName` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its contents. However, based on the context, it likely contains names associated with teams, and since `team` is 0, `GoalName[team]` would be the name associated with team 0.

Therefore, the print statement will output:

Output: **0 GoalName[0] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**
