Output State: **`line` is a list of strings obtained from reading a line of input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split by spaces; `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is an empty list, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is now `[[], []]`, `points` is now `[0, 0]`, `mov` is a dictionary mapping movement commands ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') to their corresponding changes in position coordinates, `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the field with the entry '.B': (-1, -1)**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, strips it of any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. This list is assigned to the variable `line`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
