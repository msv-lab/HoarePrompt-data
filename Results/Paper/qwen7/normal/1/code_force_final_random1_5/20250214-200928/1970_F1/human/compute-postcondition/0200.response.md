Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `com` is a string from the command list, `obj` is a string from the command list, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the first element being `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element being `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`**.

This means that the variable `nxt` has been calculated as a new position based on the current position `pos` and the movement vector `mov[com]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
