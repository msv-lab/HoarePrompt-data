Postcondition: `elements[line[ind]]` is now equal to `i`, `ind` is increased by 1. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. Otherwise, if `line[ind-1][1]` is 'G', then `elements[line[ind-1]]` is now equal to `i`, `ind` is equal to 2, `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', else 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.
