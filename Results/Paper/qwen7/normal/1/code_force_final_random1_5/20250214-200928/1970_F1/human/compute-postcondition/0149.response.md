Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `obj`, `com`, and `el` are the first, second, and third elements of the `command` list respectively, and `el` is not equal to '.Q'. If `el` equals '.S', then `team` is 0 and `points[team]` is 10. Otherwise, the values of `team`, `time`, `obj`, `com`, `el`, and `points[team]` remain unchanged.**
