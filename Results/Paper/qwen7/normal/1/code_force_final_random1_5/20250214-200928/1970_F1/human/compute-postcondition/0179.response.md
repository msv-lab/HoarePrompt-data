Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `com` is 'T', then `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, and `points[team]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and either `obj` is not equal to `.B` or `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true, and `isPlayer(obj)` is true or `elements['.B']` is equal to `nxt`.
