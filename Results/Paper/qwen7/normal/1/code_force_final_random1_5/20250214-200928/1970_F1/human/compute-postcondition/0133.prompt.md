Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `grid` now contains the `line` that was previously split from the input string, `ind` is the index of the last character of the new `line`, `elements` contains key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line`, `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `line` is a string and `ind` is an index within the string `line`. After executing the if-else block, `elements[line[ind]]` is either `False` (if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true) or not `i, ind` (if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false). If `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false, then `tmp` is 0 and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing `(i, ind)`. Otherwise, `tmp` and `goal` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `line` is a string, `ind` is an index that is 1 more than the previous value, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `i, ind`, `tmp` and `goal` remain unchanged. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is now `i, ind`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` has the additional element `(i, ind)` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is 1 more than the previous value, `line` is a string, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `i, ind`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' else 1, `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(i, ind)`, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` remains unchanged if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False, otherwise `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
