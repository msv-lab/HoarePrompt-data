Postcondition: `ind` is 1 more than the previous value, `line` is a string, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `i, ind`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' else 1, `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(i, ind)`, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` remains unchanged if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False, otherwise `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`.
