Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 3.
   - `time` is 3.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped.
   - `obj` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - `player` is assigned the value of `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is assigned the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
   ```

Given the initial state:
- `time` is explicitly stated to be 3.
- `player` is determined based on the conditions described. Since `player` is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if it is False, we need more specific information about `obj`, `isPlayer(obj)`, `elements`, `command`, `com`, `pos`, and `mov` to determine the exact value of `player`. However, without this additional information, we can only describe `player` in terms of these variables.

Since the exact value of `player` cannot be determined precisely from the given information, we will describe it as follows:

Output: **3 [player] ELIMINATED (where player is the value of obj if isPlayer(obj) returns True, otherwise it is the value of grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])**
