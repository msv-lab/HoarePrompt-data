Output State: **`team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `com` is a string from the command list, `obj` is a string from the command list, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the first element being `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element being `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`**.

This means that the function `goalIn(pos)` has been called with the current position `pos`, and its return value has been assigned to the variable `team`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
