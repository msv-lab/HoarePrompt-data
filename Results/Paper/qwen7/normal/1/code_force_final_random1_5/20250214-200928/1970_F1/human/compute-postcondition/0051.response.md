Output State: **`ind` is equal to the length of line minus one, `elements` contains key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line`, `allPlayers` is populated with keys for any player identifiers found in `line` set to `False`, `goal` contains tuples for any goal identifiers found in `line`, `line` is updated to a list of stripped and split strings from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings. This operation updates the `line` variable to reflect the new list of strings. All other variables (`ind`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
