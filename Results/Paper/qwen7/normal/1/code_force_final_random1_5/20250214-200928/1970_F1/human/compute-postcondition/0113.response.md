Output State: **`line` is a string, `ind` is an index that is 1 more than the previous value, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is now `False`, `tmp` and `goal` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` sets the value of `allPlayers` at the index `line[ind]` to `False`. The other variables (`line`, `ind`, `tmp`, and `goal`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
