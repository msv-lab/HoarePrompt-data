Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **team**: This is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`. Since the exact value of `pos` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `team`. However, we know it is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **t**: An integer greater than 0. The exact value is not specified, but we know it is a positive integer.

3. **time**: The value is explicitly given as 2.

4. **command**: A list of strings read from standard input and stripped. The exact contents of this list are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `command`.

5. **com**: A string from the `command` list. Again, the exact value is not specified.

6. **obj**: A string from the `command` list. The exact value is not specified.

7. **pos**: The value of `elements[obj]`. The exact value depends on the content of `elements` and `obj`.

8. **nxt**: A tuple where the first element is `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element is `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`. Here, `mov` is a dictionary or similar structure that maps commands to movement vectors, and `com` is one of those commands.

9. **allPlayers[obj]**: The value is explicitly given as `False`.

Given these details, the print statement is:

```python
print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

- `time` is explicitly given as 2.
- `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, but we don't have the exact value.
- `GoalName[team]` is the name associated with the team, which is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 [GoalName[team]] GOAL** (where `[GoalName[team]]` is the name associated with the team, the result of `goalIn(pos)`).
