Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `com` is a string from the command list, `obj` is a string from the command list.**

Explanation: The code `obj, com = comand` unpacks the tuple `comand` into two variables `obj` and `com`. Since `comand` is a tuple containing two elements (which are strings because they are read from standard input and stripped), `obj` and `com` will be assigned the first and second strings from the `command` list, respectively. The values of `t`, `time`, and `command` remain unchanged.
