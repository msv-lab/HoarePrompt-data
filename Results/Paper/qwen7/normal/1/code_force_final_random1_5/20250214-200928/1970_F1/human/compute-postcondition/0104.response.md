Output State: **`line` is a string, `ind` is an index within the string `line`, `elements[line[ind]]` is not `i, ind`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False, and the current value of `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0, `goal[tmp]` is now a list containing `(i, ind)`**

Explanation: The code `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since `tmp` is 0, it appends `(i, ind)` to `goal[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
