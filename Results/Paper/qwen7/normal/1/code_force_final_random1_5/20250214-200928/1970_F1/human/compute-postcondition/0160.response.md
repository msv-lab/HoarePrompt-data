Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `player` is defined as either `obj` if `obj` is a player, or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `obj` is not a player.
   - `time` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it must be assumed to be a variable that holds some integer value representing time.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))`.
   - This statement uses a formatted string to print the value of `time` followed by a space, then the value of `player`, and finally the word "ELIMINATED".

3. **Determining the Value of `player`:**
   - Since `player` can be either `obj` or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, we need to consider both cases:
     - If `obj` is a player, then `player` is `obj`.
     - If `obj` is not a player, then `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The exact value of `player` depends on the value of `obj`, but since `obj` is either a player or not, we can describe the output in a general form.

Given this analysis, the output will be a string that includes the value of `time` and the value of `player`, followed by "ELIMINATED". 

Output: **%d [player] ELIMINATED (where [player] is either obj if obj is a player, or grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] if obj is not a player, and %d is the value of time)**
