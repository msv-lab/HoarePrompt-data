Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is the value of `nxt`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `elements[obj]` to `nxt`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `obj` was previously set to the value of `elements[obj]`, now `obj` holds the value of `nxt`. All other variables retain their previous states.
