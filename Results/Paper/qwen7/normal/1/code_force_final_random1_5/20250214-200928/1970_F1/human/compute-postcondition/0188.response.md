Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped**

Explanation: The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings based on whitespace. This list is then assigned to the variable `command`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `time` is incremented by 1 due to the newline character being processed, making it 2. The initial value of `time` was 1. The command read from input is stored in `command` as a list of strings.
