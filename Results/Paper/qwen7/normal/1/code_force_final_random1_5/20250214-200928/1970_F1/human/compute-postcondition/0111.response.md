Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `ind`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the indices of the string `line`, so the loop will continue as long as `ind` is less than the length of `line`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **`line`**: This is the string that remains unchanged during each iteration of the loop.
   - **`ind`**: This is the index that increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches the length of `line`.
   - **`elements[line[ind]]`**: The value of `elements[line[ind]]` can change based on the condition inside the loop, but we need to ensure it is consistent with the given postcondition.
   - **`tmp`**: The value of `tmp` can change based on the condition inside the loop.
   - **`goal`**: The value of `goal` can change based on the condition inside the loop.

Given the postcondition, we need to ensure that:
- If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, `elements[line[ind]]` should be `False`.
- If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false, `elements[line[ind]]` should not be `i, ind`.
- If `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false, then `tmp` should be 0 and `goal[tmp]` should be a list containing `(i, ind)`.
- Otherwise, `tmp` and `goal` should remain unchanged.

Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, we need to update the state such that `ind` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`line`, `elements`, `tmp`, and `goal`) should remain consistent with the postcondition.

**State at the start of the next iteration:**
- `line` remains the same.
- `ind` is incremented by 1.
- `elements[line[ind]]` should be consistent with the postcondition.
- `tmp` and `goal` should remain unchanged unless the condition inside the loop changes them.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`line` is a string, `ind` is an index that is 1 more than the previous value, `elements[line[ind]]` is either `False` (if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true) or not `i, ind` (if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false), `tmp` and `goal` remain unchanged.**
