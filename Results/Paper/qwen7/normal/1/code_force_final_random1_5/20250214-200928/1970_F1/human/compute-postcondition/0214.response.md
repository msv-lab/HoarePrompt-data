Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `com` is a string from the command list, `obj` is a string from the command list, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the first element being `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element being `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, then `points[team]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.
