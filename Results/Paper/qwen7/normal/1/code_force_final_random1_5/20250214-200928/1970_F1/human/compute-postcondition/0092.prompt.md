Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ind` is equal to the length of line minus one, `elements` contains key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line`, `allPlayers` is populated with keys for any player identifiers found in `line` set to `False`, `goal` contains tuples for any goal identifiers found in `line`, `line` is updated to a list of stripped and split strings from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `grid` now includes the updated `line`.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ind` is now equal to the index of the last character of `line`, and `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player (i.e., `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true), then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `True`. Otherwise, if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is set to 0 and `goal[tmp]` is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind][1]` is not 'G', no additional changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is now equal to the index of the next character in `line`, `elements` is updated such that the element at the index `line[ind]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `ind` is incremented by 1. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on the value of `tmp`) has the additional element `(i, ind)` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is the index of the next character in `line` (which is `ind + 1`), `line` remains the same as before, `elements[line[ind]]` is now equal to `i`, `ind` is increased by 1. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to False. Otherwise, if `line[ind-1][1]` is 'G', then `elements[line[ind-1]]` is now equal to `i`, `ind` is equal to 2, `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', else 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
