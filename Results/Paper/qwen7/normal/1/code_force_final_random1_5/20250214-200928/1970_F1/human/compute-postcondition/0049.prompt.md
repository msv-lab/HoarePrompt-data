Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading a line of input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and split by spaces; `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line` list, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is now `[[], []]`, `points` is now `[0, 0]`, `mov` is a dictionary mapping movement commands ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') to their corresponding changes in position coordinates, `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the field with the entry '.B': (-1, -1)
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ind` is either 1 or remains 0, `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned `i`, `len(line)` remains the same, and `line[ind]` is not '..', `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is 1 or 2, `len(line)` remains the same, `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` now contains `(i, ind)`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is 2, `len(line)` remains the same, `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`; if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
