Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing 1 and -(a // b - 1)**

Given the initial state where `a` and `b` are positive integers, `a` is divisible by `b`, `a >= b`, and `b` is not equal to 0, the code snippet `return 1, -(a // b - 1)` will return a tuple.

- The first element of the tuple is explicitly set to `1`.
- The second element is calculated as `-(a // b - 1)`. Here, `a // b` gives the integer division of `a` by `b`, which results in an integer quotient. Subtracting `1` from this quotient and then negating it gives the final value of the second element.

Thus, the program returns a tuple with the first element being `1` and the second element being the negation of the integer quotient of `a` divided by `b` minus `1`.
