Output State: **a and b are positive integers where a is less than b, and b is not equal to 0; c and d are the return values of func_1(b, a)**

Explanation: The code `c, d = func_1(b, a)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a`. Since the function call does not specify what `func_1` returns, we know that `c` and `d` are assigned the return values of `func_1(b, a)`. The initial conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
