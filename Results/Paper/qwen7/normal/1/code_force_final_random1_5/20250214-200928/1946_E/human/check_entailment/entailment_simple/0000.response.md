### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Checks**:
   - The program correctly parses the input and checks if the last index of the prefix maximums matches the first index of the suffix maximums, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If these conditions are not met, it correctly prints `0`.

2. **Combinatorial Calculations**:
   - The program uses combinatorial functions to calculate the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, it uses the `func_2` function to compute binomial coefficients, which are used to determine the number of ways to arrange elements between the specified indices.
   - The `func_2` function calls `func_1`, which implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute the modular inverse and then calculates the binomial coefficient using these inverses. This is mathematically sound for computing combinations under modular arithmetic.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program ensures all calculations are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, which is necessary for the problem constraints.

4. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loops correctly iterate over the indices and apply the combinatorial logic to update the answer. The logic for updating `kol` and the multiplication of factorials is consistent with the problem requirements.

5. **Output**:
   - The final answer is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the correct logic and mathematical principles required to solve the problem. There are no apparent logical errors or inconsistencies in the code provided.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
