Output State: **The program returns the value of `c` multiplied by `a` modulo 1000000007.**

This means that the program will take the value of `c`, which was returned from `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, multiply it by the integer `a`, and then perform a modulo operation with 1000000007. The final result of this calculation is what the program returns.
