Output State: **The program returns two values, 'd' and 'c', which are the return values of func_1(b, a)**

This means that the function `func_1(b, a)` was called with `b` as the first argument and `a` as the second argument. The function `func_1` returned two values, which are stored in `c` and `d`. The program then returns these two values.
