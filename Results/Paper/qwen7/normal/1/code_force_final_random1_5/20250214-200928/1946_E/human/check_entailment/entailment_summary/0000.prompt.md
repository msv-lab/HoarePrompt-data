Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    if a < b:
        (c, d) = func_1(b, a)
        return (d, c)
    if a % b == 0:
        return (1, -(a // b - 1))
    (c, d) = func_1(b, a % b)
    return (d, c - a // b * d)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` where `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. It returns either a tuple `(1, 0)`, two values `d` and `c` from a recursive call, a tuple `(1, -(a // b - 1))`, or `d` and `c - a // b * d` from recursive calls.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a, b):
    (c, d) = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts an integer `a` and a list of integers `b`. It calls another function `func_1` with `b` and a large prime number `1000000007` as arguments. It then returns the result `c` from `func_1`, multiplied by `a` and taken modulo `1000000007`.
