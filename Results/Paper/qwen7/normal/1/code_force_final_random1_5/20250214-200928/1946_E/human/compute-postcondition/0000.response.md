Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a list of integers, `c` and `d` are the return values from `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**.

The function `func_1` is called with `b` and `1000000007` as arguments. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `c` and `d` are the return values from this function call. The initial values of `a` and the list `b` remain unchanged.
