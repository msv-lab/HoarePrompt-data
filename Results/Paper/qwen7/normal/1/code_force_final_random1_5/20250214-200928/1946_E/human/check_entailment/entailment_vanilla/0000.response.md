Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The prefix maximums are the indices where the value is the largest in the prefix ending at that index.
   - The suffix maximums are the indices where the value is the largest in the suffix starting at that index.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each prefix maximum must be greater than all previous elements.
   - Each suffix maximum must be greater than all subsequent elements.
   - The intersection of these conditions can significantly reduce the number of possible permutations.

3. **Provided Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute the modular multiplicative inverse.
   - `func_2(a, b)`: This function uses the result from `func_1` to compute \(a \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

4. **Relevance to the Problem:**
   - The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is used to find the modular multiplicative inverse, which is not directly relevant to solving the permutation problem.
   - The problem requires combinatorial counting and not modular arithmetic operations.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The problem can be solved using combinatorial methods, specifically by counting the valid permutations based on the given constraints.
   - The solution involves dynamic programming or combinatorial counting techniques to count the valid permutations.

### Conclusion

Given the provided functions do not address the core combinatorial counting required to solve the problem, and the problem description suggests a more complex combinatorial approach rather than simple modular arithmetic, the provided program is **incorrect**.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
