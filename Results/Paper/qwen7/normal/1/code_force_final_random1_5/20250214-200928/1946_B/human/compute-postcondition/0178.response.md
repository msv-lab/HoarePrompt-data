Output State: **`sm` is now equal to -2, `a` is 2, and the value of `sm` is less than 0.**

Explanation: Initially, `sm` is equal to 2 + `suf[n]`, and `sm` is less than 0. This implies that `suf[n]` must be less than -2. After executing the line `a = abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `a` is assigned the absolute value of `sm` (which is 2) divided by `(10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since `10 ** 9 + 7` is a large number, the division results in `a` being 2. The value of `sm` remains -2 because no operation changes its value.
