Output State: **`i` is 1; `suf` has an updated element at index `i` which is equal to `suf[1] + l[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends a new element to the list `suf`. Since `i` is initially 1, the new element added to `suf` is the sum of `suf[1]` and `l[1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
