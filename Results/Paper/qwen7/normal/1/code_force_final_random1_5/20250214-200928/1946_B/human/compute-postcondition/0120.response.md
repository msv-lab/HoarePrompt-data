Output State: **`sm` is equal to `sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)` and is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` to its remainder when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). Since `sm` was initially equal to `suf[n]` and was also greater than or equal to 0, after applying the modulo operation, `sm` remains non-negative and is now the remainder of the division of `sm` by \(10^9 + 7\).
