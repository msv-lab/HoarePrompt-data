Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using map(int, input().split()), `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `t + 2`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and now includes `smin[i]` which is equal to `smin[i]` (since `smin.append(smin[i])` appends the current value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`).**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `smin` has been updated to include its current value at index `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
