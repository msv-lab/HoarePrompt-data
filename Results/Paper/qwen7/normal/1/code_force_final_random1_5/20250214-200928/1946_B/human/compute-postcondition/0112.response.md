Output State: **The value of `sm` is updated to the maximum value among `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, and `i` is `n`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n`, updating `sm` to the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` encountered during these iterations. If no update occurs (i.e., `sm` remains -111 throughout), then `sm` will still be -111. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`.
