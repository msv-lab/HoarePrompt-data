Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(t)`. The only variable here is `j`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j < t`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)
   - `j` is 1 (since it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration)
   - `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`
   - `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`
   - `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself
   - `n` is equal to `t`
   - `i` is equal to `n`
   - `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration
   - `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `j < t`, and `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - All other variables remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `j` is 2, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is equal to `n`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`**.
