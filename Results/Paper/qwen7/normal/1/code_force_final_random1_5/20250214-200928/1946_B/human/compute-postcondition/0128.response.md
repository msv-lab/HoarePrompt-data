Output State: **`sm` is equal to `suf[n]`, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` over the input string split.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in `l`. The other variables (`sm`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
