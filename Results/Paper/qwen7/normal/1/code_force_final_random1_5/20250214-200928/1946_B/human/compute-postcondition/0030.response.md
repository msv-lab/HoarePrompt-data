Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given `for` loop is `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)
   - `j` is 0
   - `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`
   - `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`
   - `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `i` is equal to `t + 1`
   - `smin` is a list starting with 0 and now includes either `suf[i + 1]` (if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`) or an additional element which is `smin[i]` (if `suf[i + 1] >= smin[i]`).

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `t + 1` and the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, the next value of `i` will be `t + 2`.
   - `j` remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop.
   - `b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `n`, and `smin` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using map(int, input().split()), `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `t + 2`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and now includes either `suf[i + 1]` (if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`) or an additional element which is `smin[i]` (if `suf[i + 1] >= smin[i]`).**
