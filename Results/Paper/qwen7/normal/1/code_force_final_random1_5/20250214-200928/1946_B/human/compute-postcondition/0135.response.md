Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `suf` is updated such that `suf[k+2] = suf[k+1] + l[k+1]`.
   - This implies that `k` is being incremented by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `suf` will be updated according to the rule `suf[k+2] = suf[k+1] + l[k+1]` where `k` is now `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `suf[i+3] = suf[i+2] + l[i+2]`.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1` (which means `i` becomes `i + 1`).
   - `suf` will be updated accordingly.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`suf[k+3] = suf[k+2] + l[k+2]`, `i` is `i + 1`**. 

Since `k` is effectively `i` in this context, the final state can be simplified to:

**State: **`suf[i+3] = suf[i+2] + l[i+2]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
