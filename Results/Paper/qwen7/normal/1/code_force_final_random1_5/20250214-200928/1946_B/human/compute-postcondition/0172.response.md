Postcondition: `sm` is updated such that if the difference between `suf[i]` and `smin[i]` is greater than the current value of `sm` or if `sm` is -111, then `sm` is set to the value of `suf[i] - smin[i]`. Otherwise, the value of `sm` remains unchanged. `i` is 2 (1 more than its previous value), and `n` remains the same.
