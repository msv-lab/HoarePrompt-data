Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using map(int, input().split()), `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `t`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and now has an additional element which is `smin[i]`, `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`**

Explanation: The code appends `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. Since `i` is equal to `t`, `smin` now contains an additional element which is `smin[t]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
