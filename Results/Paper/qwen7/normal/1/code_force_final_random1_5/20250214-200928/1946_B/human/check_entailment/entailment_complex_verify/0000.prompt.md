You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will depend on the values of `t`, `k`, and the list `l`. However, based on the given information, we can infer the following:
    #
    #- The variable `sm` will be calculated as described in the loop logic.
    #- If `sm` is less than 0, it will be adjusted to 9999999995.
    #- Otherwise, `sm` will be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
    #- After the loop completes, `sm` will be adjusted further based on its value: if `sm` is less than 0, it will be set to 9999999995; otherwise, it will be taken modulo 10.
    #
    #Given the specific output states after the first three iterations, we can deduce that the final value of `sm` will be 9999999995 if `sm` is less than 0, and otherwise, it will be the remainder of `sm` when divided by 10.
    #
    #Thus, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: **The value of `sm` will be either 9999999995 if it is less than 0, or the remainder of `sm` when divided by 10 otherwise.**
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t, two integers n and k, and an array of n integers. For each test case, it calculates a value `sm` based on the array and the given parameters. If `sm` is less than 0, it sets `sm` to 9999999995; otherwise, it takes `sm` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Finally, it prints the resulting value of `sm` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing k operations. Specifically, the logic used to calculate `sm` does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements. 

The program attempts to use a suffix sum array (`suf`) and a minimum suffix sum array (`smin`) to find the maximum possible sum. However, the calculation of `sm` as `2 ** k * sm - sm` and the subsequent adjustments do not align with the problem statement. The intended approach should involve using the subarray sums and the operations to maximize the array sum, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this.

A counterexample where the program fails is as follows:

Input:
```
3 2
-1 -2 -3
```

Expected output:
```
-1
```

However, the program outputs a much larger value, indicating that it does not correctly handle the case where the array elements are negative and the goal is to minimize the sum rather than maximize it.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
