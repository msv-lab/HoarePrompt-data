Output State: **`sm` is equal to `suf[n]`, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` over the input string split, `suf` is a list containing 0.**

Explanation: The code `suf.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `suf`. Initially, `suf` was an empty list. After appending `0`, `suf` now contains one element, which is `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
