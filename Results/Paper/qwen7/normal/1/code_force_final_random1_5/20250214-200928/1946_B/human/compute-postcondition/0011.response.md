Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using map(int, input().split()), `suf` is [0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1]], `n` is `t`, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends a new value to the list `suf`. Given that `i` is 1 before the execution of this line, `suf[i]` refers to `suf[1]` which is `suf[0] + l[0]`. Therefore, the new value appended to `suf` is `suf[1] + l[1]`, which is `(suf[0] + l[0]) + l[1]`. Thus, `suf` becomes `[0, suf[0] + l[0], (suf[0] + l[0]) + l[1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
