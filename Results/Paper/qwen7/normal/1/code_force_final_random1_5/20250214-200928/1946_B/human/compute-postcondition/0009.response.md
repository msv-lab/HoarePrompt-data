Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using map(int, input().split()), `suf` is [0, suf[0] + l[0]], `n` is `t`, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of the first element of `suf` and the first element of `l` to the list `suf`. Initially, `suf` is `[0]`, so after appending, `suf` becomes `[0, 0 + l[0]]`, which simplifies to `[0, l[0]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
