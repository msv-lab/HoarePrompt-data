Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `smin` includes the value of `suf[i + 1]`, and all other variables (`suf`, `smin`, `sm`, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n`) remain the same.**

This means that `i` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `suf[i + 1]` has been appended to the list `smin`. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
