Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `suf` is updated such that `suf[0]` is equal to `suf[0] + l[0]`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration. Since it is currently 0, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` is not explicitly given as changing, so we assume `n` remains the same.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to 1 for the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The state of `suf` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted here.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be the same as before**
