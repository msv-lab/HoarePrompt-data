Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `smin` now contains the element `suf[2]`**

Explanation: The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `i + 1` equals 2. Therefore, `suf[2]` is appended to `smin`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` is greater than 0 is still valid.
