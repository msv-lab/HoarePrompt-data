State: **`sm` is -111, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0** 

Explanation:
- The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
- For the loop `for i in range(n + 1)` to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0 because `range(n + 1)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive.
- The variable `sm` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted unless there's additional context that isn't provided here. Initially, `sm` is set to -111, but this value doesn't affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are to ensure `i` starts at 0 (which is the default starting point for `range`) and `n` must be greater than or equal to 0 to allow the loop to execute.
