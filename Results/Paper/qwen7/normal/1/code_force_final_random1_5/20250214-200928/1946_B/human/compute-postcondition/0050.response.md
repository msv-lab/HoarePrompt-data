Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `j` is 1, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is equal to `n`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`.

This means that after all the iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, which is the same as the original value of `t`. The variable `j` remains 1 as it was incremented only once outside the loop. The lists `b`, `suf`, `l`, `smin`, and the value of `sm` will reflect the final state after processing all elements from `i = 0` to `i = n`.
