Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().split()` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `b`. The values of `t` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.
