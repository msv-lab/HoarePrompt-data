Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `suf` is a list of length `n+1` where each element `suf[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n`) is the sum of the first `j+1` elements of the list `l`. The variable `sm` remains as the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`, and all other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `smin`, and `n`) retain their values from the initial state or after the first 3 iterations.
