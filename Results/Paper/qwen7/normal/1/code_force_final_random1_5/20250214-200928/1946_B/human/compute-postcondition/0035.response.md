Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to the original value of `t`, `i` is equal to `t + n - 1`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, each being the minimum value encountered so far in `suf`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `t + n - 1`, as it increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The variable `smin` will contain up to `n` elements, each representing the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that point. The other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `n`) retain their values from the initial state or post the first iteration, as they are not modified within the loop.
