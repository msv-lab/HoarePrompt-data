Output State: **`sm` is `suf[i] - smin[i]`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and either the difference between `suf[i]` and `smin[i]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is -111.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` to be the difference between `suf[i]` and `smin[i]`. Since `i` was initially 0, `sm` is now `suf[0] - smin[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition about `n` and the comparison involving `sm` remains the same.
