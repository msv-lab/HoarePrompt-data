Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `sm` is updated based on the condition: if the difference between `suf[i+1]` and `smin[i+1]` is greater than the current value of `sm` or if `sm` is -111, then `sm` is set to the value of `suf[i+1] - smin[i+1]`. Otherwise, the value of `sm` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `sm` remains the same unless it is updated according to the condition in the loop body.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `sm` remains unchanged unless it is updated in the next iteration.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`sm` is updated such that if the difference between `suf[i+2]` and `smin[i+2]` is greater than the current value of `sm` or if `sm` is -111, then `sm` is set to the value of `suf[i+2] - smin[i+2]`. Otherwise, the value of `sm` remains unchanged. `i` is 1 more than its previous value, and `n` remains the same.**
