Output State: **After all iterations, `smin` will contain the minimum values encountered in `suf` up to each index, and it will be extended by appending the final minimum value found during the loop.**

To explain this output state in more detail:
- The variable `smin` starts with a single element `[0]`.
- During each iteration of the loop, the code compares `suf[i + 1]` with the current value of `smin[i]`.
- If `suf[i + 1]` is smaller, `smin[i]` is updated to `suf[i + 1]`.
- If `suf[i + 1]` is not smaller, `smin[i]` remains unchanged, but the current value of `smin[i]` is appended to `smin`.
- After all iterations, `smin` will include the smallest value encountered in `suf` up to each index, and it will be extended by appending the final minimum value found during the loop.

This means that `smin` will have `n+1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the rest of the elements are the minimum values found in `suf` up to each index, followed by the final minimum value.
