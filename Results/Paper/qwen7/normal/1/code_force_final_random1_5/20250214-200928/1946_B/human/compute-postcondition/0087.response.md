Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `smin` is updated by appending `smin[i]` to itself, and all other variables (`suf`, `smin`, `sm`, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n`) remain the same.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`. The list `smin` is updated by appending `smin[i]` (which is `smin[i-1]` from the previous state) to itself. All other variables remain unchanged.
