Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 1, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is 2, `smin` is updated to include the minimum value between `suf[2]` and the last element of `smin`, `sm` is updated based on the new value of `i` (sm = suf[2] - smin[2])**.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `t` remains within the specified range, `j` becomes 1, `b` and `k` remain unchanged as they are derived from the input string, `l` is the list of integers from the split input, `suf` is the list of cumulative sums of `l`, `n` equals `t`, `i` becomes 2, `smin` is updated to include the minimum value between `suf[2]` and the last element of `smin`, and `sm` is updated to `suf[2] - smin[2]`.
