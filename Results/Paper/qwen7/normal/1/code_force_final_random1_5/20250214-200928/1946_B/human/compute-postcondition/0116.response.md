Output State: **`sm` is equal to `suf[n]` and the value of `sm` is less than 0; `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by (10 ** 9 + 7)**.

Explanation: The value of `sm` remains unchanged and is still equal to `suf[n]` and less than 0. The variable `a` is assigned the value of the absolute value of `sm` divided by `(10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since the exact value of `sm` is not specified, `a` is expressed in terms of `sm`.
