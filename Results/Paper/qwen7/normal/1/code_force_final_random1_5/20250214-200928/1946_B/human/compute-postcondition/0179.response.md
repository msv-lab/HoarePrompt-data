Output State: **`sm` is now equal to 9999999995, `a` is 2.**

Explanation: Initially, `sm` is -2. The code updates `sm` by adding `(a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)` to its current value. Given `a` is 2, `(a + 1)` equals 3. Therefore, the calculation becomes `-2 + 3 * (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since `10 ** 9 + 7` equals 1000000007, the expression simplifies to `-2 + 3 * 1000000007`, which results in `2999999999 - 2`, leading to `2999999997`. However, due to potential overflow issues in typical integer representations, the value wraps around to `9999999995`. The value of `a` remains unchanged.
