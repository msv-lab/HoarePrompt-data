Output State: **`sm` is -111**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `-111` to the variable `sm`. Since no other operations are performed, the values of the other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `n`, `suf`, and `smin`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `sm` is updated to `-111`, which is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`, as per the initial state description.
