Output State: **`i` is 2; `suf` is a list with an additional element at the end, which is equal to `suf[2] + l[2]`.**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 2, and `suf` has an updated element at index `i` which is equal to `suf[1] + l[1]`. After executing `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])`, the list `suf` gets an additional element at the end, which is calculated as `suf[2] + l[2]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
