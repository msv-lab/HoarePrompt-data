Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the `range(n)` function.
   - The loop variable `n` is used in the `range(n)` function.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `j` is 0.
   - `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0]]`.
   - `n` is `t`.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `n` is equal to `t`, and `i` starts at 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and remain less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1, and `n` remains `t`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `t` remains greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `j` remains 0.
   - `b` remains the same list of strings.
   - `k` remains the integer value of the second element in the list `b`.
   - `l` remains the list of integers obtained from converting the input string.
   - `suf` remains `[0, suf[0] + l[0]]`.
   - `n` remains `t`.
   - `i` becomes 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using map(int, input().split()), `suf` is [0, suf[0] + l[0]], `n` is `t`, `i` is 1**
