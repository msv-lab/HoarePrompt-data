Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variable that changes within the loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. This means that `i` was previously `i - 1`.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The condition for the next iteration is that `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` is `i - 1 + 1 = i`.

4. **Update the State**: We need to update the state to reflect the new value of `i` and ensure that the condition `i < n` holds true for the next iteration.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `suf[i + 1]` is compared with `smin[i]`.
- If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin[i]` is updated to `suf[i + 1]`.
- Otherwise, `smin[i]` is appended to itself.
- All other variables (`suf`, `smin`, `sm`, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n`) remain the same.

Since the only variable that changes is `i`, and it is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `i - 1 + 1 = i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is now `i - 1 + 1 = i`.
- `suf`, `smin`, `sm`, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n` remain the same.

State: **`i` is `i - 1 + 1 = i`, `suf`, `smin`, `sm`, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n` remain the same**.
