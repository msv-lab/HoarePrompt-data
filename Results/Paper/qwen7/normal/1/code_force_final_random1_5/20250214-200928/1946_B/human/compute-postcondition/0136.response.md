Output State: **`suf[i+3] = suf[i+2] + l[i+2]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `suf` is updated by appending `suf[i] + l[i]`.**

Explanation: The initial state includes the assignment `suf[i+3] = suf[i+2] + l[i+2]` and `i` is `i + 1`. The code snippet appends `suf[i] + l[i]` to the list `suf`. Since the exact values of `i`, `suf`, and `l` are not specified, we know that `suf` is updated by appending the value of `suf[i] + l[i]` to itself. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
