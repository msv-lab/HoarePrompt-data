Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `j` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j < t`.

3. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `j` is 1.
   - `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`.
   - `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself.
   - `n` is equal to `t`.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration.
   - `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`.
   - `sm` is updated to \(2^k \times sm - sm\); if `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is increased by `suf[n]` and then the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\) taking the floor value is added to `sm`; otherwise, `sm` is increased by `suf[n]` and then taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop condition is `j < t`, the next iteration will occur if `j` is incremented to 2 (i.e., `j` becomes 2).
   - The other variables (`b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `n`, `i`, `smin`, and `sm`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `j` is incremented to 2.
   - All other variables (`b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `n`, `i`, `smin`, and `sm`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `j` is 2, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is equal to `n`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`**.
