Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into a list of strings using `split()`, and then converts each string in the list to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `l`. The values of `t`, `j`, `b`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
