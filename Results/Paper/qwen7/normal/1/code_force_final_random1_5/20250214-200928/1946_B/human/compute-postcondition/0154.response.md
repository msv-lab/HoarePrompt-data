Output State: **`i` is 3, `smin` has its last element appended with `suf[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given that `i` was initially 2, `i + 1` becomes 3. Therefore, `smin` now has its last element updated to `suf[3]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `suf`, and `smin` from the previous iteration remain unchanged except for the addition of `suf[3]` to `smin`.
