Postcondition: `sm` is updated such that if the difference between `suf[i+1]` and `smin[i+1]` is greater than the current value of `sm` or if `sm` is -111, then `sm` is set to the value of `suf[i+1] - smin[i+1]`. Otherwise, the value of `sm` remains unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same as before.
