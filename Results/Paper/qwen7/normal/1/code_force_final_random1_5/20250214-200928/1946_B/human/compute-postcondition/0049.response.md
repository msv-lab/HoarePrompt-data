Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `j` is 1, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is equal to `t + n - 1`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` remains within the range of 0 to \(10^4\), `j` is set to 1, and the other variables (`b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `n`, `i`, `smin`, `sm`) reflect the final state after processing all elements in the list `l`. Specifically, `sm` will hold the highest value found during the iterations of the loop, which is the difference between `suf[i]` and the corresponding element in `smin` at each step.
