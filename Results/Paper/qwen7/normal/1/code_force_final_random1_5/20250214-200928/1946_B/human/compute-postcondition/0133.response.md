Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition is `range(n)`, which means `i` will iterate from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `suf` is updated such that `suf[i+1] = suf[i] + l[i]`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `0 <= k < n-1`), and `suf[k+1]` was updated.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `k+1`.
   - Therefore, `suf[k+2]` will be updated next according to the formula `suf[i+1] = suf[i] + l[i]`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `k+1`.
   - The condition `n > 0` remains unchanged as long as `n` is still greater than 0.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`suf` is updated such that `suf[i+1] = suf[i] + l[i]` where `i` is now `k+1`, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
