Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - `i`: The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`. Therefore, `i` should start at 0.
   - `n`: The variable `n` is defined as the first element of `b` converted to an integer. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` will not include `n` itself).

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - We know `n` is equal to the first element of `b` converted to an integer, and `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 1.
   - Since `i` starts from `n` and the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`, we need to adjust `i` to start from 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should start from 0.
- `n` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**
