Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `smin` is a list with one additional element which is `suf[1]`, `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `suf[i + 1]` (which is `suf[1]` since `i` is 0) to the list `smin`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `smin` now contains one more element, which is `suf[1]`. The condition that `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]` still holds true, but now `smin[i]` refers to `smin[0]`, which is the newly added element.
