Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a valid line of input starting from the second line.
- `n` is the integer representation of the first element in `s` split by spaces and converted to integers.
- `k` is the integer representation of the second element in `s` split by spaces and converted to integers.
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values from splitting and converting the string `s`.

The print statement `print(2 * n)` will multiply the value of `n` by 2 and print it.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **2 * n (where n is the integer representation of the first element in s split by spaces and converted to integers)**
