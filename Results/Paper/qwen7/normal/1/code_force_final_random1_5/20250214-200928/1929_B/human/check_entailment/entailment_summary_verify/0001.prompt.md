You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. If `4 * n - 2` equals `k`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Cells to Color:**
   - The program checks if `4 * n - 2` (total number of diagonals) is equal to `k`.
     - If they are equal, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

3. **Problem Statement Understanding:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The key insight here is that each cell can belong to up to 4 diagonals (two main diagonals and two anti-diagonals).

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - When `4 * n - 2 == k`, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed as `k // 2 + 1`. This is because each cell can cover 2 diagonals, so we need to cover `k` diagonals with the minimum number of cells.
   - For other cases, the program uses `ceil(k / 2)`. This approach is generally correct but let's verify it:
     - Each cell covers 2 diagonals, so the minimum number of cells required to cover `k` diagonals is `ceil(k / 2)`.
     - However, this might not always be the optimal solution, especially when `k` is close to `4 * n - 2`.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the examples provided:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 3`, `k = 4`
  - Total diagonals: `4 * 3 - 2 = 10`
  - Since `10 != 4`, the program computes `ceil(4 / 2) = 2`.
  - Correct answer: 2 (as shown in the diagram).

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `k = 10`
  - Total diagonals: `4 * 3 - 2 = 10`
  - Since `10 == 10`, the program computes `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`.
  - Correct answer: 6 (as shown in the diagram).

- **Test Case 5:** `n = 4`, `k = 7`
  - Total diagonals: `4 * 4 - 2 = 14`
  - Since `14 != 7`, the program computes `ceil(7 / 2) = 4`.
  - Correct answer: 4 (as shown in the diagram).

### Conclusion

After verifying the examples and understanding the logic, the program appears to handle the cases correctly. The approach of using `ceil(k / 2)` when `4 * n - 2 != k` and `k // 2 + 1` when `4 * n - 2 == k` is sound and matches the requirements of the problem.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **True**
