Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `t` is `t - 1`**.

This means that the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the integers input by the user, split by space and converted to integers. The value of `t` has been updated to `t - 1`. The initial state of `n` and `k` being integer inputs from the user and `t` being `t - 1` remains valid after the code execution.
