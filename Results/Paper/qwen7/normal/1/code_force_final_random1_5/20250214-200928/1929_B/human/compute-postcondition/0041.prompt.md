Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    if k <= 4 * n - 4:
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    elif k == 4 * n - 3:
        print(2 * n - 1)
    elif k == 4 * n - 2:
        print(2 * n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a valid line of input starting from the second line; `n` is the integer representation of the first element in `s` split by spaces and converted to integers; `k` is the integer representation of the second element in `s` split by spaces and converted to integers. If `k` is less than or equal to 4 times `n` minus 4, no change is made to the values of `k` and `n`. Otherwise, if `k` is either 4 times `n` minus 3 or 4 times `n` minus 2, then the respective condition is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a valid line of input starting from the second line; `n` is the integer representation of the first element in `s` split by spaces and converted to integers; `k` is the integer representation of the second element in `s` split by spaces and converted to integers; if `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, `n` and `k` retain their original values after being assigned from splitting and converting the string `s`. If `k` equals `4 * n - 3`, `n` and `k` are reassigned such that `k` becomes `4 * n - 3`. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, no change is made to `n` and `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the next valid line of input starting from the second line; `n` is the integer value of the first element in `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer; `k` is the integer value of the second element in `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer. If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, no change is made to the variables. If `k` equals `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`, no change is made to the variables. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
