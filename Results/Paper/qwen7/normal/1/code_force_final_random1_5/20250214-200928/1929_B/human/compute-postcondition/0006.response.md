Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where k is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, and ceil is the ceiling function that rounds up to the nearest integer)**

Explanation:
- `n` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
- `k` is another integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
- The condition `4 * n - 2 != k` ensures that `k` is not equal to `4 * n - 2`.

The `print` statement outputs the result of `ceil(k / 2)`, which is the ceiling of `k / 2`. The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, the output remains in terms of `k`.
