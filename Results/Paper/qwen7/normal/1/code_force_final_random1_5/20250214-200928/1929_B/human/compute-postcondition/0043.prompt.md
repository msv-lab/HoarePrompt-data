You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to process each line of input until there are no more lines left. For each line, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically:
    #
    #- If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, `k` remains unchanged.
    #- If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 3`, `k` is set to `4 * n - 3`.
    #- If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, `k` is set to `4 * n - 2`.
    #
    #After processing all lines of input, the final values of `n` and `k` for the last line processed will be printed according to the conditions in the loop body. The loop will terminate when there are no more lines to process.
    #
    #In summary, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be the final values of `n` and `k` from the last line of input processed, adjusted according to the specified conditions, and the printed result will be the appropriate value based on those conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and n and k are integers satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2. It returns different outputs based on the values of n and k.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
