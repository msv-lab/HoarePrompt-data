You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: Output State: All inputs `n` and `k` from each iteration of the loop have been processed, and the corresponding outputs have been printed. The variable `t` has been decremented until it reaches 0, indicating that all iterations of the loop have completed.
    #
    #In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
    #- The variable `t` will be 0.
    #- For each iteration, either the condition `4 * n - 2 == k` was met, in which case `k // 2 + 1` was printed, or the condition was not met, in which case `ceil(k / 2)` was printed.
    #- The variables `n` and `k` from each iteration are no longer relevant as the loop has completed, but their values during the last iteration are the most recent ones used in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables t, n, and k, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and n and k are integers with 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2. It returns a value based on the relationship between n and k.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
