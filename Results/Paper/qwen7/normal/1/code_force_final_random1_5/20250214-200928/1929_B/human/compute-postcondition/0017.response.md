Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer.
- `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer.
- `t` is `t - 1`, but since `t` is not used in the print statement and its value is not relevant to the output, we can ignore it.

The print statement is `print(ceil(k / 2))`.

The `ceil` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the division of `k` by 2. Since `k` is an integer, the result of `k / 2` will be a float, and `ceil` will round this up to the nearest integer if necessary.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling of `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2)**
