Postcondition: `s` is a valid line of input starting from the second line; `n` is the integer representation of the first element in `s` split by spaces and converted to integers; `k` is the integer representation of the second element in `s` split by spaces and converted to integers; `n` and `k` are assigned the values from splitting and converting the string `s`. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, no change is made to `n` and `k`.
