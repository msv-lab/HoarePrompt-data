Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates the difference between the largest and smallest values in the sorted list. It then prints this difference for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the differences for each test case.**
