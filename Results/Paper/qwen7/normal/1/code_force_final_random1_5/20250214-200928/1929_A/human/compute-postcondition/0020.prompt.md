You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `ntest` is an input integer which represents the total number of times the loop has run. `itest` will be equal to `ntest - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. For each iteration, `n` is an input integer representing the size of the list `a`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to each element of the input split by spaces. The final output of the loop will be the difference between the largest and smallest elements in each list `a` printed during the iterations.
    #
    #In summary, `ntest` equals the total number of iterations, `itest` is `ntest - 1`, and for each `itest` from 0 to `ntest - 1`, there exists an `n` and a sorted list `a` of integers, with the output being the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a list of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
