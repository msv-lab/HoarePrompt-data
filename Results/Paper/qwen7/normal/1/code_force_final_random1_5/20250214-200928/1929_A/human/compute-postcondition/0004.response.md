Output State: **`ntest` is an input integer, `itest` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to each element of the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`ntest`, `itest`, and `n`) remain unchanged. The list `a` now contains the integers from the input, sorted.
