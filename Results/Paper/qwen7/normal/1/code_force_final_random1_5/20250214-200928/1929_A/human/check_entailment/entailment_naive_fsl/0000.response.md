Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The program sorts the array and prints the difference between the last and first elements, which is not necessarily the maximum beauty of the array. For example, consider the input:

```
3
3
2 1 3
```

The correct maximum beauty is 2, which can be achieved by rearranging the array to [1, 3, 2]. However, the program sorts the array to [1, 2, 3] and outputs `3 - 1 = 2`, which is correct in this specific case but fails to consider other possible arrangements that might yield a higher beauty. For instance, consider another input:

```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```

The correct maximum beauty is 57, which can be achieved by rearranging the array to [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. However, the program sorts the array to [43, 54, 80, 90, 100] and outputs `100 - 43 = 57`. While this particular case works, the program does not guarantee the maximum beauty for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
