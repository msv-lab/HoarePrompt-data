Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ntest` is an input integer. This is not used in the code snippet.
   - `itest` is set to 2.
   - `n` is an input integer from the user.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to each element of the input split by spaces.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers. Let's denote the elements of this list as `a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]` where `n` is the length of the list.
   - `a[len(a) - 1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`, which is `a[n-1]`.
   - `a[0]` refers to the first element of the list `a`, which is `a[0]`.

4. **Calculation:**
   - The expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the last element and the first element of the list `a`.

5. **Output:**
   - Since the exact values of the elements in the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of the list.

Output: **the difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted list `a`**
