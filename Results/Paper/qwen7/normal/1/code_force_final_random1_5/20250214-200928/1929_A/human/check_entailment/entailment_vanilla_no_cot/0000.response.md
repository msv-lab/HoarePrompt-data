Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in the solution only finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences as required by the problem statement. To maximize the beauty, we should pair the smallest elements with the largest elements in a specific way when calculating the differences.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        max_beauty = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            max_beauty += a[n - 1 - i] - a[i]
        if n % 2 != 0:
            max_beauty += a[n // 2]
        print(max_beauty)

func()
```

This corrected program sorts the array and then iteratively pairs the smallest and largest remaining elements to maximize the sum of differences, ensuring the correct maximum beauty of the array.
