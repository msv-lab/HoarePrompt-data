Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
   - The variable `n` determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Initial Values Before the Loop**:
   - `n` is given as an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `start` is -1, which is not used in the loop.
   - `end` is 1000000000.0, which is also not used in the loop.
   - `num` is an empty list, which is not used in the loop.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that the loop can start and run properly.
   - `i` should start at 0.
   - `n` should be a valid integer within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` starting at 0 and `n` being a valid integer within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100**
