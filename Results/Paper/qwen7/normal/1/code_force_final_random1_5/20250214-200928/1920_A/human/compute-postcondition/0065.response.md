Postcondition: `count_num` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a non-empty list containing all `v` where `t` is 3, and `i` is within the range [start, end].
