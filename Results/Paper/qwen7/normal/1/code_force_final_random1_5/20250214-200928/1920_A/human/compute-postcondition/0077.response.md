Postcondition: **`count_num` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the second element in `num`, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a non-empty list containing all `v` where `t` is 3. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, `count_num` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count_num` changes to either 1 or 2.**
