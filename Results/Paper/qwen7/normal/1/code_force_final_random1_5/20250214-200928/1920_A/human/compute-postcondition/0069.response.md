Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in num`. The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the list `num`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was outside the range `[start, end]` if `count_num` is 0, otherwise `i` was within the range `[start, end]`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is the only variable directly involved in the loop head, we need to ensure that `i` is set to the next element in the list `num`.
   - For the loop to continue, `num` must still contain at least one element.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `count_num` remains the same because it is not directly involved in the loop head.
- `i` needs to be set to the next element in `num`.
- `t`, `v`, `start`, `end`, and `num` remain the same unless the loop body changes them, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they stay the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `count_num` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the next element in `num`, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a non-empty list containing all `v` where `t` is 3.**
