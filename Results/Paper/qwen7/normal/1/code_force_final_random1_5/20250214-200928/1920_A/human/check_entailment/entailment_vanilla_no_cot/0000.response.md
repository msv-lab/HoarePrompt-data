Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Constraints:**
   - The function `func_7` does not properly handle the constraints. Specifically, it does not correctly account for the constraints where `k` must be not equal to some integer (`t == 3`).
   - The logic to exclude values from the range `[start, end]` when they are not equal to any of the excluded values (`num`) is flawed. It should only exclude those values that lie within the range `[start, end]`.

2. **Unnecessary Functions:**
   - Most of the functions defined (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`) are not used in the main logic and are unnecessary for solving the problem.

3. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The logic to calculate the number of valid `k` values is incorrect. For example, it should check if the excluded values (`num`) fall within the range `[start, end]` and subtract their count from the total range size (`end - start + 1`).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = float('inf')
    end = float('-inf')
    num = set()
    for _ in range(n):
        t, v = map(int, input().split())
        if t == 1:
            start = min(start, v)
        elif t == 2:
            end = max(end, v)
        elif t == 3:
            num.add(v)
    
    # Calculate the number of valid k values
    if start > end:
        return 0
    valid_count = end - start + 1
    for val in num:
        if start <= val <= end:
            valid_count -= 1
    return valid_count

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    print(func_7())
```

This corrected version properly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid `k` values correctly.
