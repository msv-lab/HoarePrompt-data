Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 (from 0 to 1).
   - Therefore, `i` becomes 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still satisfy \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `i` is now 1.
- `n` remains within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).

Thus, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100**
