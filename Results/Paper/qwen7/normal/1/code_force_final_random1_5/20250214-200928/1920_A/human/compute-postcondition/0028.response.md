Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `t` and `v`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 1, and `n` is still an integer within the range 2 to 100. The values of `t` and `v` are the integers input by the user.
