Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is 2, `end` is `v`, and `v` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `end = v` simply assigns the value of `v` to `end`. The values of `i`, `n`, `t`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `end` is greater than `v` is no longer valid since `end` is now equal to `v`.
