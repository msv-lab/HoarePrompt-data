Output State: **`count_num` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first element in `num`, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a non-empty list containing all `v` where `t` is 3**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided, the variables `count_num`, `i`, `t`, `v`, `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `continue` statement does not modify any of these variables or their values.
