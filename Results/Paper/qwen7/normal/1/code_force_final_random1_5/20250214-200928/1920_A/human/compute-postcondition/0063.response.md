Output State: **`count_num` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a non-empty list containing all `v` where `t` is 3, and the current value of `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their states remain unchanged from the initial state. The conditions regarding the values of `i`, `start`, and `end` also remain valid.
