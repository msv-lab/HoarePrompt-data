Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints. Constraints are of three types: \( k \geq x \), \( k \leq x \), and \( k \neq x \).
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function is used to get the number of test cases and the number of constraints per test case.
   - **func_2**: This function is not directly used in the main logic but could be used for parsing input data.
   - **func_3**: This function is not used in the main logic.
   - **func_4**: This function is not used in the main logic.
   - **func_5**: This function is not used in the main logic.
   - **func_6**: This function is not used in the main logic.
   - **func_7**: This function processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers \( k \).

3. **Function `func_7` Analysis**:
   - It correctly identifies the minimum value \( start \) from constraints of type 1 (\( k \geq x \)).
   - It correctly identifies the maximum value \( end \) from constraints of type 2 (\( k \leq x \)).
   - It collects all values from constraints of type 3 (\( k \neq x \)) into a list.
   - It checks if any of the collected values from type 3 constraints fall within the range \([start, end]\) and excludes them from the count.
   - If \( start > end \), it returns 0 because no \( k \) can satisfy both constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) using the formula \( end - start + 1 - count_num \).

Given the detailed analysis, the function `func_7` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
