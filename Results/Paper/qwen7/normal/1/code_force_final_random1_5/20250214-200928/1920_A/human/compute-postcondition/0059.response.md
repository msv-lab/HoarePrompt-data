Output State: **`count_num` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2, and `num` is a list containing all `v` where `t` is 3.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `count_num` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `t`, `v`, `start`, `end`, or `num`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
