Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `t` and `v`. The initial values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The values of `t` and `v` are specifically the integers entered by the user. The range of `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) is mentioned in the initial state and remains valid.
