Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all constraints. Specifically, it fails to account for the case where there are overlapping constraints of type 3 (k must not equal some integer x). This can lead to an incorrect count of valid integers k.

For example, consider the following input:
- Test case with `n = 4` constraints:
  ```
  1 3
  2 10
  3 1
  3 5
  ```

The program should find that the valid range for k is between 4 and 9, excluding 1 and 5. However, the current implementation does not correctly exclude these values from the count. Instead, it only considers the range and subtracts the count of excluded values, which can lead to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the exclusion of specific values more carefully, ensuring that the final count of valid integers is accurate.
