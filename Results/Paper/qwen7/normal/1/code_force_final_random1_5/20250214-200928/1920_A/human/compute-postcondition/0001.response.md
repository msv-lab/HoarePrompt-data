Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `start` is -1.**

The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `start`. Since `n` is an input integer within the specified range and no other changes are made to `n`, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes both `n` and the updated `start` value.
