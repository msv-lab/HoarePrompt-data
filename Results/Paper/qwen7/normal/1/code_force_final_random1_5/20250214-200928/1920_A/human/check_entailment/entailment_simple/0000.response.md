Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is not correctly implemented. It should return the number of test cases (`t`) and the number of constraints (`n`) for each test case. However, it currently returns either 1 or an integer input by the user, which does not align with the problem requirements.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is not used in the main logic and is not relevant to the problem. It seems to be a placeholder or incorrectly named.
3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is not used in the main logic and is not relevant to the problem. It seems to be a placeholder or incorrectly named.
4. **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the main logic and is not relevant to the problem. It seems to be a placeholder or incorrectly named.
5. **Function `func_5`**: This function is not used in the main logic and is not relevant to the problem. It seems to be a placeholder or incorrectly named.
6. **Function `func_6`**: This function is not used in the main logic and is not relevant to the problem. It seems to be a placeholder or incorrectly named.
7. **Function `func_7`**: This function correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It initializes `start` and `end` based on the constraints of type 1 and 2, and then counts the number of integers `k` that do not equal any value in `num` (constraints of type 3). Finally, it calculates the number of valid `k` values within the range `[start, end]`.

Given the above analysis, the main logic in the annotated program is correct, but the auxiliary functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`) are not relevant to the problem and are incorrectly implemented or named.

Correctness: **False**
