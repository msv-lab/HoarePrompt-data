Output State: **`s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, `pos` is decremented by 1, and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`.**

Explanation: The line `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` calls the function `recursive_maximize_sum` with the updated arguments `pos + 1` and `r`. The value of `pos` is decremented by 1, but the actual decrement operation does not affect the output state description since the function call already uses the updated value of `pos + 1`. The other variables (`s`, `mx`, `pos`) retain their previous values as no operations are performed on them within this line of code.
