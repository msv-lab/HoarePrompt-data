Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the tuple `(l, r)` which is generated by the `ops` list from the `enumerate` function. Therefore, the relevant variables here are `l`, `r`, and `ops`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `ops`**: Since `ops` is the result of the function `func_2(a)`, we need to consider what `func_2(a)` returns. Typically, `func_2(a)` would return a list of tuples, each representing a range `(l, r)`.

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple. If `ops` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Initial values of `l` and `r`**: Since `ops` is a list of tuples, before the loop starts, `l` and `r` should be set to the values of the first tuple in `ops`. If `ops` is empty, `l` and `r` can be undefined or set to a default value, but typically, they would be undefined if the loop doesn't execute.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `ops` must contain at least one tuple.
- `l` and `r` should be the values of the first tuple in `ops`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`, `ops` must contain at least one tuple, `l` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, and `r` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`.**
