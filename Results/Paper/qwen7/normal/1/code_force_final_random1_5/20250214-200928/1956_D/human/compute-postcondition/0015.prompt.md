You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s, m, ops = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    #This is printed: the sum of all elements in the list `a` and the maximum value in the list `a`
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\), `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`, and `ops` contains exactly three tuples `(l, r)`. The first tuple has `l` as the first element and `r` as the second element of the first tuple, the second tuple has `l` as the first element and `r` as the second element of the second tuple, and the third tuple has `l` as the first element and `r` as the second element of the third tuple.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `ops` will contain exactly three operations, each specified by a tuple `(l, r)`, and these tuples will be printed out by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies an input through its constraints: an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. It returns either an integer or a specific value based on the input list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
