Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `recursive_maximize_sum` are defined but not used correctly. Specifically, `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without defining `ops` as a global variable or passing it correctly.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is designed to modify the array and record operations, but it does not handle the MEX calculation properly. It also incorrectly sets `a[l]` to 0 when it should be setting it to the MEX value.

3. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The MEX of a segment of the array is not being calculated correctly. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the segment, and this needs to be determined before setting all elements in the segment to this value.

4. **Recursive Approach Issues**: The recursive approach in `recursive_maximize_sum` does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and updating the array segments.

5. **Output Format**: The output format is not correctly implemented. The program should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves, but the current implementation does not produce the correct output format.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to implement a different approach that correctly calculates the MEX for each segment and updates the array accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    mex = 0
    while mex in a[l:r+1]:
        mex += 1
    for i in range(l, r+1):
        a[i] = mex
    ops.append((l, r))

def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    for i in range(n):
        func_1(a, i, n-1, ops)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)

func_3()
```

This corrected version ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly and the array is updated accordingly.
