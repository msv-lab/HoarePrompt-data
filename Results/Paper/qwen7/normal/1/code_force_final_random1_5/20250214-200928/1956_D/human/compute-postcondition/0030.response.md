Functionality: **The function `recursive_maximize_sum` takes two parameters, `l` and `r`, which define a sublist within the list `a`. It aims to maximize the sum of the elements in this sublist by performing certain operations. If the sum of the elements in the sublist from index `l` to `r` is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\), it sets all elements in this sublist to \(r - l + 1\). Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the sublist, updates the sublist to ensure the sum is maximized by recursively calling itself on the left and right parts of the sublist excluding the position of the maximum element, until the condition is met. The function does not return any value; instead, it modifies the list `a` in place and updates the `ops` list with the operations performed.**
