Postcondition: **`s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive. If `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, then all elements in the sublist of `a` from index `l` to `r` are set to `r - l + 1`, and `i` is set to `r + 1`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist plus `l`, and if `pos` is not equal to `r`, `pos` is decremented by 1 and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further changes are made to `pos`.**
