The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user. It then calls another function `func_2` with the list `a` and receives the sum `s` of all elements in `a`, the maximum value `m` in `a`, and a list of operations `ops`. It prints the sum `s` and the maximum value `m`. After that, it prints three specific operations specified by the tuples `(l, r)` contained in `ops`. The function does not return any value but modifies the output by printing the required information.
