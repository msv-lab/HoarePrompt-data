Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array `a` by performing at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting all elements from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray `a[l...r]`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - To maximize the sum, we should aim to make the subarray values as large as possible while ensuring the MEX is minimized.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function recursively sets the subarray from `l` to `r` to the value `r - l + 1`.
   - It ensures that the subarray is filled with the smallest possible values that do not conflict with the rest of the array.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function to maximize the sum.
   - It returns the sum of the array and the number of operations performed.

5. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:**
   - This function attempts to maximize the sum by considering the current subarray.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1) \times (r - l + 1)\), it calls `func_1` to fill the subarray.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right parts of the subarray.

6. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly sets the subarray to the smallest possible values without conflicts.
  - However, it might not handle edge cases where the subarray already contains the required MEX value.

- **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
  - The logic to decide whether to fill the entire subarray or process parts of it seems correct.
  - However, the condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` might not always be optimal. For example, if the subarray has a mix of small and large values, this condition might not capture the best strategy.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function appears to call the recursive function and return the results correctly.

- **Function `func_3`**:
  - This function reads input and outputs the results correctly.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the functions, the primary concern is the correctness of the logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`. The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` might not always yield the optimal solution. However, the overall approach seems to be on the right track.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution is likely to work within the given limits but may not always produce the absolute optimal solution.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

The program is likely to produce a good solution but may not always find the absolute maximum sum due to the heuristic used in `recursive_maximize_sum`.
