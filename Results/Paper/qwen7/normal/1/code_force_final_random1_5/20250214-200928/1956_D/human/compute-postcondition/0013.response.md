Output State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\), `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`, and `ops` contains exactly three tuples `(l, r)`. The first tuple has `l` as the first element and `r` as the second element of the first tuple, the second tuple has `l` as the first element and `r` as the second element of the second tuple, and the third tuple has `l` as the first element and `r` as the second element of the third tuple.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `ops` will contain exactly three operations, each specified by a tuple `(l, r)`, and these tuples will be printed out by the loop.
