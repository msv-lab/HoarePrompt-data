As usual,\neveryone was lined up and asked to settle in \"the first\u2013k -th\" position.\n\nAs is known, settling in \"the first\u2013k -th\" position occurs as follows: the\nfirst k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have\nnumbers k - 1, k - 2, \\ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,\n\\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.\nExamples of settling are given in the \"Note\" section.\n\nThe boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number\nk described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as\nwell as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how\nmany natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.\n\nNote that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means\nthat the settling does not exist for k = 1 .\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\leq t \\leq 100 ) \u2014 the number of test cases.

In other words, the sequence p is\nfixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.\n\nTo ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \\le a,b,c,d\n< n ) and print the line of the following form:\n\n  * \"? a b c d\" \n\nAfter that, you receive:\n\n  * \"<\" if (p_a \\mid p_b) < (p_c \\mid p_d) ; \n  * \"=\" if (p_a \\mid p_b) = (p_c \\mid p_d) ; \n  * \">\" if (p_a \\mid p_b) > (p_c \\mid p_d) . \n\nYou can make at most 3n queries of this form.\n\nNext, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \\le i, j < n )\nsuch that p_i \\oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:\n\n  * \"! i j\" \n\nNote that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account\nwhen counting the number of queries asked.\n\nAfter this, proceed to the next test case.\n\nIf you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must\nterminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.\nOtherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will\ncontinue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output\nthe end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict\nIdleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * see the documentation for other languages. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack, follow the test format below.\n\nThe first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \\le t \\le 10^3 ). The\ndescription of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \\le n \\le 10^4 ).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\\ldots,p_{n-1} ,\nwhich represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .\n\nThe sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    2\n    4\n    \n    <\n    \n    =\n    \n    >\n    \n    2\n    \nOutput\n\n    ? 0 2 3 1\n    \n    ? 1 1 2 3\n    \n    ? 1 2 0 3\n    \n    ! 3 2\n    \n    ! 0 1\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .\n\nFor the query \"? 0 2 3 1\", the jury return \"<\" because (p_0 \\mid p_2) = (0\n\\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \\mid p_1) = (2 \\mid 3) = 3 .\n\nFor the query \"? 1 1 2 3\", the jury return \"=\" because (p_1 \\mid p_1) = (3\\mid\n3)= 3 = (p_2 \\mid p_3) = (1 \\mid 2)=3 .\n\nFor the query \"? 1 2 0 3\", the jury return \">\" because (p_1 \\mid p_2) = (3\n\\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \\mid p_3) = (0\\mid 2)=2 .\n\nThe answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \\oplus p_2) = (2 \\oplus 1) = 3 is\nindeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \\oplus p_j . Another valid\nanswer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,\nthe answer is considered correct.\n\nIn the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any\ncase, p_0 \\oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.",

There are four suits: clubs,\ndiamonds, hearts, and spades. We will encode them with characters 'C', 'D',\n'H', and 'S', respectively. And there are 8 ranks, in increasing order: '2',\n'3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'.\n\nEach card is denoted by two letters: its rank and its suit. For example, the 8\nof Hearts is denoted as 8H.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, one suit is chosen as the trump suit.\n\nIn each round, players make moves like this: the first player places one of\nhis cards on the table, and the second player must beat this card with one of\ntheir cards. After that, both cards are moved to the discard pile.\n\nA card can beat another card if both cards have the same suit and the first\ncard has a higher rank than the second. For example, 8S can beat 4S.\nAdditionally, a trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of the rank\nof the cards, for example, if the trump suit is clubs ('C'), then 3C can beat\n9D. Note that trump cards can be beaten only by the trump cards of higher\nrank.\n\nThere were n rounds played in the game, so the discard pile now contains 2n\ncards. You want to reconstruct the rounds played in the game, but the cards in\nthe discard pile are shuffled. Find any possible sequence of n rounds that\nmight have been played in the game.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains integer t (1 \\le t \\le 100 ) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Then t test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains the integer number n (1\\le n\\le 16 ).\n\nThe second line of a test case contains one character, the trump suit. It is\none of \"CDHS\".\n\nThe third line of a test case contains the description of 2n cards. Each card\nis described by a two-character string, the first character is the rank of the\ncard, which is one of \"23456789\", and the second one is the suit of the card,\nwhich is one of \"CDHS\".

Today, although\nBob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy\nexactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each\ncontaining an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each\nstall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .\n\nFortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,\nbuy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as\npossible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the\nnumber of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that\nAlice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is\nimpossible to do so.\n\nNote that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t\n(1 \\le t \\le 1000 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test\ncases follows.\n\nEach test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \\le n, k \\le 10^{18}\n) \u2014 the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to\nhave bought at the end.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print on one line \"YES\" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls\nand set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or\n\"NO\" if it is impossible to do so.\n\nIf the answer is \"YES\", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \\le s \\le 60\n) \u2014 the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s\npositive integers p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_s (1 \\le p_i \\le 10^{18}) that represent\nsuch a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .\nIf there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    3\n    \n    7 3\n    \n    6 4\n    \n    255 8\n\nOutput\n\n    YES\n    10\n    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\n    NO\n    YES\n    8\n    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left\nwith 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining\nstalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.\n\nIn the third test case,\n\n  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. \n  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. \n  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. \n  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. \n  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. \n  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. \n  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. \n  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. \n\nTherefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.",

        "description": "Two players are playing an online card game. The game is played using a\n32-card deck. Each card has a suit and a rank. There are four suits: clubs,\ndiamonds, hearts, and spades. We will encode them with characters 'C', 'D',\n'H', and 'S', respectively. And there are 8 ranks, in increasing order: '2',\n'3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'.\n\nEach card is denoted by two letters: its rank and its suit. For example, the 8\nof Hearts is denoted as 8H.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, one suit is chosen as the trump suit.\n\nIn each round, players make moves like this: the first player places one of\nhis cards on the table, and the second player must beat this card with one of\ntheir cards. After that, both cards are moved to the discard pile.\n\nA card can beat another card if both cards have the same suit and the first\ncard has a higher rank than the second. For example, 8S can beat 4S.\nAdditionally, a trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of the rank\nof the cards, for example, if the trump suit is clubs ('C'), then 3C can beat\n9D. Note that trump cards can be beaten only by the trump cards of higher\nrank.\n\nThere were n rounds played in the game, so the discard pile now contains 2n\ncards. You want to reconstruct the rounds played in the game, but the cards in\nthe discard pile are shuffled. Find any possible sequence of n rounds that\nmight have been played in the game.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains integer t (1 \\le t \\le 100 ) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Then t test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains the integer number n (1\\le n\\le 16 ).\n\nThe second line of a test case contains one character, the trump suit. It is\none of \"CDHS\".\n\nThe third line of a test case contains the description of 2n cards. Each card\nis described by a two-character string, the first character is the rank of the\ncard, which is one of \"23456789\", and the second one is the suit of the card,\nwhich is one of \"CDHS\". All cards are different.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the answer to it:\n\n  * Print n lines. In each line, print the description of two cards, in the same format as in the input: the first card that was played by the first player, and then the card that was used by the second player to beat it.\n  * If there is no solution, print a single line \"IMPOSSIBLE\".\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    8\n    \n    3\n    \n    S\n    \n    3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S\n    \n    2\n    \n    C\n    \n    3S 5D 9S 6H\n    \n    1\n    \n    H\n    \n    6C 5D\n    \n    1\n    \n    S\n    \n    7S 3S\n    \n    1\n    \n    H\n    \n    9S 9H\n    \n    1\n    \n    S\n    \n    9S 9H\n    \n    1\n    \n    C\n    \n    9D 8H\n    \n    2\n    \n    C\n    \n    9C 9S 6H 8C\n\nOutput\n\n    3C 4C\n    6D 9S\n    3S 7S\n    IMPOSSIBLE\n    IMPOSSIBLE\n    3S 7S\n    9S 9H\n    9H 9S\n    IMPOSSIBLE\n    6H 9C\n    9S 8C",

If one firework\nwas launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one\nminute.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the\nsame time?\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then follow the\ndescriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \\le\na, b, m \\le 10^{18} ) \u2014 the frequency of launching for the first installation,\nthe second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each set of input data, output a single number \u2014 the maximum number of\nfireworks that can be seen simultaneously.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    6 7 4\n    \n    3 4 10\n    \n    7 8 56\n    \n    5 6 78123459896\n    \n    1 1 1\n    \n    1 1 1000000000000000000\n\nOutput\n\n    2\n    7\n    17\n    28645268630\n    4\n    2000000000000000002\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5\nminutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and\nthe second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same\ninstallation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same\ntime, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the\nfirst and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to\nsee no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.\n\nIn the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112\nminutes:\n\n  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; \n  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].",

The j -th\nelement of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .\n\nShe can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:\n\n  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \\le j \\le n simultaneously. \n  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \\le j \\le n simultaneously. \n\nNene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix\n\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the\nway to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't\nwant to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more\nthan 2n operations.\n\nA permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1\nto n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but\n[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is\nalso not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

You can ask queries of the\nfollowing type:\n\n  * \"? d \" \u2014 Kostyanych tells you the number of vertex v with a degree at least d . Among all possible such vertices, he selects the vertex with the minimum degree, and if there are several such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. He also tells you the number of another vertex in the graph, with which v is not connected by an edge (if none is found, then 0 is reported). Among all possible such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. Then he removes the vertex v and all edges coming out of it. If the required vertex v is not found, then \"0\\ 0 \" is reported. \n\nFind a Hamiltonian path^{\\ddagger} in the original graph in at most n queries.\nIt can be proven that under these constraints, a Hamiltonian path always\nexists.\n\n^{\\dagger} A complete undirected graph is a graph in which there is exactly\none undirected edge between any pair of distinct vertices. Thus, a complete\nundirected graph with n vertices contains \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} edges.\n\n^{\\ddagger} A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path that passes through each\nvertex exactly once.\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 1000 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of\nthe test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \\le n \\le 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .\n\nInteraction\n\nInteraction for each test case begins with reading the integer n .\n\nThen you can make no more than n queries.\n\nTo make a query, output a line in the format \"? d \" (without quotes) (0 \\le d\n\\le n - 1 ). After each query, read two integers \u2014 the answer to your query.\n\nWhen you are ready to report the answer, output a line in the format \"! v_1\\\nv_2 \\ldots v_n \" (without quotes) \u2014 the vertices in the order of their\noccurrence in the Hamiltonian path. Outputting the answer does not count as\none of the n queries. After solving one test case, the program should\nimmediately move on to the next one. After solving all test cases, the program\nshould be terminated immediately.\n\nIf your program makes more than n queries for one test case or makes an\nincorrect query, then the response to the query will be -1 , and after\nreceiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to\nreceive the verdict Wrong answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.\n\nAfter outputting a query, do not forget to output an end of line and flush the\noutput buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Idleness limit\nexceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * see documentation for other languages. \n\nThe interactor is non-adaptive. The graph does not change during the\ninteraction.\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack, use the following format:\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 1000 ) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \\le n \\le 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nEach of the following (n - 2) lines should contains two integers u and v (1\n\\le u, v \\le n , u \\ne v ) \u2014 ends of the edge that was removed from the graph.\nEach edge must not occur more than once.\n\nThe sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^5 .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    3\n    4\n    \n    0 0\n    \n    1 4\n    \n    2 3\n    \n    4\n    \n    1 0\n    \n    4 2\n    \n    2\n    \n    1 0\n    \nOutput\n\n    ? 3\n    \n    ? 2\n    \n    ? 1\n    \n    ! 4 3 1 2\n    \n    ? 3\n    \n    ? 0\n    \n    ! 4 1 2 3\n    \n    ? 0\n    \n    ! 2 1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the original graph looks as follows:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75d8c5328ccca8f82b69ba8300140bed4d40ce80.png)\n\nConsider the queries:\n\n  * There are no vertices with a degree of at least 3 in the graph, so \"0\\ 0 \" is reported.\n  * There are four vertices with a degree of at least 2 , and all of them have a degree of exactly 2 : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Vertex 1 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 4 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 1 . After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.\n  * There are three vertices with a degree of at least 1 , among them vertices 2 and 3 have a minimum degree of 1 (vertex 4 has a degree of 2 ). Vertex 2 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 3 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 2 . After this, vertex 2 is removed from the graph.\n\nThe path 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 is a Hamiltonian path.\n\nIn the second test case, the original graph looks as follows:\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/44d26c229eaff752c0a00c7160792daef41c7502.png)\n\nConsider the queries:\n\n  * Vertex 1 has a degree of at least 3 , but it is connected to all vertices, so \"1\\ 0 \" is reported. After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.\n  * The remaining vertices 2 , 3 , and 4 have a degree of at least 0 , but among them vertex 4 has the minimum degree of 0 (vertices 2 and 3 have a degree of 1 ). Vertex 4 is not connected to both vertices 2 and 3 , so vertex 2 is reported (as it has the minimum number). After this, vertex 4 is removed from the graph.\n\nThe path 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 is a Hamiltonian path.\n\nIn the third test case, the graph consists of 2 vertices connected by an edge.",

Cow i has a Cowdeforces\nrating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament\nconsists of n-1 matches as follows:\n\n  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . \n  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . \n  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. \n\nYou are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;\nrather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an\nacquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the\nposition of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do\nnothing.\n\nFind the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t\n(1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test\ncases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \\le n \\le\n10^5, 1 \\le k \\le n ) \u2014 the number of cows and your cow's index.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1\n\\le a_i \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that\na_i 's are pairwise different.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can\nachieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    3\n    \n    6 1\n    \n    12 10 14 11 8 3\n    \n    6 5\n    \n    7 2 727 10 12 13\n    \n    2 2\n    \n    1000000000 1\n\nOutput\n\n    1\n    2\n    0\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces\nrating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then\n\n  * Initially, a' = [\\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . \n  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . \n  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. \n\nIn total, your cow wins 1 match.\n\nIn the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,\nlet a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.\n\n  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . \n  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . \n  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . \n  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . \n  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. \n\nIn total, your cow wins 2 matches.",

        "description": "One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the\ncamp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,\nthe organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks\nand a huge number of shells for launching.\n\nBoth installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation\nlaunches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \\cdot a, 3 \\cdot a, \\dots\nminutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b\nminutes (i.e., after b, 2 \\cdot b, 3 \\cdot b, \\dots minutes after launch).\n\nEach firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a\nfirework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,\nit will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework\nwas launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one\nminute.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the\nsame time?\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then follow the\ndescriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \\le\na, b, m \\le 10^{18} ) \u2014 the frequency of launching for the first installation,\nthe second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each set of input data, output a single number \u2014 the maximum number of\nfireworks that can be seen simultaneously.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    6\n    \n    6 7 4\n    \n    3 4 10\n    \n    7 8 56\n    \n    5 6 78123459896\n    \n    1 1 1\n    \n    1 1 1000000000000000000\n\nOutput\n\n    2\n    7\n    17\n    28645268630\n    4\n    2000000000000000002\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5\nminutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and\nthe second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same\ninstallation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same\ntime, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the\nfirst and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to\nsee no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.\n\nIn the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112\nminutes:\n\n  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; \n  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].",

Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1\nthrough n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where\ncards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).\n\nIn the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and\nNene so that each player receives n cards.\n\nAfter it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n\nturns, starting with you. On each turn:\n\n  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. \n  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. \n\nNote that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the\ntable at each moment.\n\nNene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize\nher score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal\nmoves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.\n\nMore formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her\nscore in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in\nthe end of the game in the second place.\n\nAssuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have\nintegers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of\npoints you can get by taking your turns optimally?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

It is guaranteed that each integer\nfrom 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n at most 2\ntimes.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can\nget.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    4\n    \n    1 1 2 3\n    \n    8\n    \n    7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5\n    \n    8\n    \n    7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6\n    \n    3\n    \n    1 2 3\n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n\nOutput\n\n    1\n    2\n    1\n    0\n    0\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3\n. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may\nproceed as follows:\n\n  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. \n  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. \n  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. \n  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. \n  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. \n  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. \n  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. \n  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. \n\nAt the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be\nshown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the\nanswer is 1 .\n\nIn the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points\nand Nene scores 6 points.",

And in case of losing, he will lose the entire\nbet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).\n\nNote that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot\nexceed Sasha's current number of coins.\n\nSasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more\nthan x times in a row.\n\nInitially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that\nhe is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that\nfor any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not\ncontradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at\nleast n coins.\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 1000 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of\nthe test cases follows.\n\nThe single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \\leq k\n\\leq 30 , 1 \\leq x \\leq 100 , 1 \\leq a \\leq 10^9 ) \u2014 the number of times the\nbet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,\nand the initial number of coins Sasha has.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and\n\"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\",\n\"yes\" and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive answer).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    9\n    \n    2 1 7\n    \n    2 1 1\n    \n    2 3 15\n    \n    3 3 6\n    \n    4 4 5\n    \n    5 4 7\n    \n    4 88 1000000000\n    \n    25 69 231\n    \n    13 97 18806\n\nOutput\n\n    YES\n    NO\n    YES\n    NO\n    NO\n    YES\n    NO\n    NO\n    NO\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:\n\n  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.\n  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.\n\nNote that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.\n\nIt can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he\nwants.\n\nIn the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But\nin case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not\nbe able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.",

Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1\nthrough n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where\ncards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).\n\nIn the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and\nNene so that each player receives n cards.\n\nAfter it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n\nturns, starting with you. On each turn:\n\n  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. \n  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. \n\nNote that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the\ntable at each moment.\n\nNene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize\nher score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal\nmoves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.\n\nMore formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her\nscore in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in\nthe end of the game in the second place.\n\nAssuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have\nintegers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of\npoints you can get by taking your turns optimally?\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of\ntest cases t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) \u2014 the\nnumber of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le n ) \u2014\nthe integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer\nfrom 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n at most 2\ntimes.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can\nget.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    5\n    \n    4\n    \n    1 1 2 3\n    \n    8\n    \n    7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5\n    \n    8\n    \n    7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6\n    \n    3\n    \n    1 2 3\n    \n    1\n    \n    1\n\nOutput\n\n    1\n    2\n    1\n    0\n    0\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3\n. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may\nproceed as follows:\n\n  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. \n  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. \n  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. \n  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. \n  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. \n  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. \n  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. \n  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. \n\nAt the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be\nshown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the\nanswer is 1 .\n\nIn the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points\nand Nene scores 6 points.",

        "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,\nnumbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both\nplayers have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with\ncoordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at\n(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not\ncoincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.\n\nOn her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or\ndown-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,\nup-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board\nboundaries.\n\nMore formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with\ncoordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +\n1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from\nthe cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b\n- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions\n1 \\le x' \\le h and 1 \\le y' \\le w .\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)\nExample game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.\nArrows indicate possible moves.\n\nA player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the\nother player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice\u2014if she is in\nthe last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob\u2014if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),\nthe game immediately ends in a draw.\n\nWhat will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. This is followed by\nthe description of the test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,\ny_a , x_b , y_b (1 \\le x_a, x_b \\le h \\le 10^6 , 1 \\le y_a, y_b \\le w \\le 10^9\n) \u2014 the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's\nchips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \\ne x_b or y_a \\ne y_b .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output \"Alice\" if Alice wins, \"Bob\" if Bob wins, and\n\"Draw\" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in\nany case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings \"bOb\", \"bob\",\n\"Bob\", and \"BOB\" will be accepted as Bob's victory.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    12\n    \n    6 5 2 2 5 3\n    \n    4 1 2 1 4 1\n    \n    1 4 1 3 1 1\n    \n    5 5 1 4 5 2\n    \n    4 4 1 1 4 4\n    \n    10 10 1 6 10 8\n    \n    10 10 2 6 10 7\n    \n    10 10 9 1 8 1\n    \n    10 10 8 1 10 2\n    \n    10 10 1 1 2 1\n    \n    10 10 1 3 4 1\n    \n    10 10 3 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n\n    Alice\n    Bob\n    Draw\n    Draw\n    Draw\n    Alice\n    Draw\n    Draw\n    Bob\n    Alice\n    Alice\n    Draw",

The only difference between the two\nversions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \\leq y \\leq n - x . You\ncan make hacks only if both versions are solved.\n\nBessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in\nthe form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are\nnumbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of\nthose vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other\nwords, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.\n\nBessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle\nto keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake\ndoes not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in\nthe cake, but those will not be counted).\n\nBessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form\ndiagonals.

He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to\nadd at most one problem to fix it.\n\nFor this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The\ncomplexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th\nfunction is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \\le i \\le\nm , 1 \\le j \\le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,\nhe obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted\ninto the array a ).\n\nTo determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the\nproblems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i\n> 1 ).\n\nWhat is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at\nmost one problem, created according to the described rules?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4 ) \u2014\nthe number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \\le\nn \\le 10^5 , 1 \\le m, k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 ) \u2014 the number of prepared problems,\nthe number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots a_n\n(1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) \u2014 the complexities of the\nprepared problems.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \\dots d_m\n(1 \\le d_i \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the complexities of the models.\n\nThe fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \\dots f_k\n(1 \\le f_i \\le 10^9 ) \u2014 the complexities of the functions.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \\cdot\n10^5 .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, output a single number \u2014 the minimum imbalance that Rudolf\ncan achieve.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    7\n    \n    5 5 5\n    \n    5 10 15 20 26\n    \n    11 14 16 13 8\n    \n    16 4 5 3 1\n    \n    7 6 5\n    \n    1 4 7 10 18 21 22\n    \n    2 3 5 7 4 2\n    \n    6 8 9 3 2\n    \n    7 6 5\n    \n    1 4 7 10 18 21 22\n    \n    2 3 5 7 4 2\n    \n    6 8 13 3 2\n    \n    5 6 3\n    \n    2 10 13 20 25\n    \n    11 6 10 16 14 5\n    \n    6 17 15\n    \n    4 2 2\n    \n    11 12 14 15\n    \n    19 14\n    \n    10 6\n    \n    8 4 2\n    \n    3 10 16 18 21 22 29 30\n    \n    9 13 16 15\n    \n    4 2\n    \n    2 4 7\n    \n    4 21\n    \n    4 15 14 5\n    \n    20 1 15 1 12 5 11\n\nOutput\n\n    5\n    4\n    5\n    8\n    2\n    7\n    11",

When a\nplayer switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a\nspecially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.\nThis video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in\nother words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is\nthe same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .\nTherefore, you need to create \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,\none for each possible pair of different scenarios.\n\nEach transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too\nmany funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is\nto create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the\nplayer approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \\lceil\n\\frac{3n}{4} \\rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.\n\nYou have already come up with ideas for at most \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor of\nthe transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or\nscary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos\nin such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \\le n \\le 24 ) \u2014 the number of\nscenarios in the game.\n\nThe next n lines describe the partial transition video plan. Each of those\nlines contains n characters. The j -th character of the i -th line corresponds\nto the transition video between the i -th and the j -th scenarios. It will be\nF if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding\ntransition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is\nstill undecided, or . if i=j .\n\nIt is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th\ncharacter of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is\nguaranteed that at most \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded\ndown) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most\n2\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as\nthe input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character\nof the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S\nif the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .\n\nEach ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all\nother characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that\nthe i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th\nline are the same for all i and j .\n\nFor each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition\nvideos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more\nthan \\lceil \\frac{3n}{4} \\rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the\nsame type consecutively.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

The houses to the left of it will be\ndeclared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the\nright-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 .

The road\nalso may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the\nentire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.\n\nTo make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half\nof the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.\nThat is, among x residents on one side, at least \\lceil\\frac{x}{2}\\rceil\nshould want to live on that side, where \\lceil x \\rceil denotes rounding up a\nreal number x .\n\n![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75baa17903d65a630fb0d3334683e857d5fdc345.png)\nTo the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j\nthere must be at least \\lceil\\frac{i}{2}\\rceil zeros.

Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \\le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \\mid p_b) and y = (p_c \\mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .\n\nPlease find any two indices i and j (0 \\le i,j < n ) such that p_i \\oplus p_j\nis maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are\nmultiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of\nthem.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

The description of the test cases follows.\n\nInteraction\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \\le n \\le 10^4 ).\nAt this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \\ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The\ninteractor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is\nfixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.\n\nTo ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \\le a,b,c,d\n< n ) and print the line of the following form:\n\n  * \"? a b c d\" \n\nAfter that, you receive:\n\n  * \"<\" if (p_a \\mid p_b) < (p_c \\mid p_d) ; \n  * \"=\" if (p_a \\mid p_b) = (p_c \\mid p_d) ; \n  * \">\" if (p_a \\mid p_b) > (p_c \\mid p_d) . \n\nYou can make at most 3n queries of this form.\n\nNext, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \\le i, j < n )\nsuch that p_i \\oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:\n\n  * \"! i j\" \n\nNote that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account\nwhen counting the number of queries asked.\n\nAfter this, proceed to the next test case.\n\nIf you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must\nterminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.\nOtherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will\ncontinue to read from a closed stream.\n\nAfter printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output\nthe end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict\nIdleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * see the documentation for other languages. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .\n\nHacks\n\nTo hack, follow the test format below.\n\nThe first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \\le t \\le 10^3 ). The\ndescription of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \\le n \\le 10^4 ).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\\ldots,p_{n-1} ,\nwhich represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .\n\nThe sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n    2\n    4\n    \n    <\n    \n    =\n    \n    >\n    \n    2\n    \nOutput\n\n    ? 0 2 3 1\n    \n    ? 1 1 2 3\n    \n    ? 1 2 0 3\n    \n    ! 3 2\n    \n    ! 0 1\n    \nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .\n\nFor the query \"? 0 2 3 1\", the jury return \"<\" because (p_0 \\mid p_2) = (0\n\\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \\mid p_1) = (2 \\mid 3) = 3 .\n\nFor the query \"? 1 1 2 3\", the jury return \"=\" because (p_1 \\mid p_1) = (3\\mid\n3)= 3 = (p_2 \\mid p_3) = (1 \\mid 2)=3 .\n\nFor the query \"? 1 2 0 3\", the jury return \">\" because (p_1 \\mid p_2) = (3\n\\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \\mid p_3) = (0\\mid 2)=2 .\n\nThe answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \\oplus p_2) = (2 \\oplus 1) = 3 is\nindeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \\oplus p_j .

The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with a stone on\nexactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists of picking\nan inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there\n(thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after which he\nalternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player that\ncannot make a move loses the round.
