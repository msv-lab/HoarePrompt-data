Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. I need to determine whether the program meets the requirements as specified, and if it does, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". The key here is to ensure that the program handles all possible cases correctly, and if it fails even in one scenario, it's considered incorrect.

Let's first understand the problem description and the provided program.

**Problem Description:**

Bob has a rectangle of size a × b. He tries to cut this rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then, Bob tries to form some other rectangle from the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90° rotation, they are considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6×4 and 4×6 are considered the same.

The task is to determine if Bob can obtain some other rectangle different from the original one through this process.

**Input:**

- The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

- Each of the next t lines contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) — the dimensions of Bob's rectangle.

**Output:**

- For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle, otherwise "No".

**Program:**

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

So, the program is reading the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the dimensions a and b, and checks if either a or b is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

Now, I need to verify if this logic correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle different from the original one.

**Understanding the Logic:**

First, let's understand what the problem is asking. Bob wants to cut his rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides, and then rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one (considering rotations as the same).

The program's logic is straightforward: if either a or b is even, then it's possible to cut and rearrange the rectangles to form a new one; otherwise, it's not possible.

I need to verify if this is indeed the correct approach.

**Analyzing the Approach:**

Let's think about how Bob can cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces.

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**

- Bob can make a cut parallel to one of the sides, meaning he can either cut along the length a or along the width b.

- If he cuts parallel to side a, he's dividing the width b into two parts.

- If he cuts parallel to side b, he's dividing the length a into two parts.

2. **Forming a New Rectangle:**

- After cutting, he has two smaller rectangles.

- He can rotate and move these pieces to try to form a new rectangle.

- The new rectangle should be different from the original one, considering that rotations don't count as different.

**Case Analysis:**

Let's consider different cases to see if the program's logic holds.

**Case 1: Both a and b are odd.**

- If both a and b are odd, then any cut made will result in rectangles with at least one odd dimension.

- When trying to rearrange these pieces to form a new rectangle, the total area remains the same (a*b), but the new rectangle must have different dimensions from the original, considering rotations.

- However, due to the odd dimensions, it might not be possible to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

- For example, with a=1, b=1: It's impossible to cut this into two smaller rectangles.

- With a=3, b=1: Cutting parallel to a would divide b into two parts, but b=1, which is odd, so cutting isn't possible without resulting in non-integer sides, which is against the problem's constraints.

- Hence, in such cases, it's not possible to form a new rectangle, which aligns with the program's output of "No" when both a and b are odd (since a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1).

**Case 2: At least one of a or b is even.**

- If a is even, then a can be divided into two integers that sum up to a.

- Similarly, if b is even, b can be divided into two integers that sum up to b.

- The question is whether these cuts can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

- Let's consider an example where a=2, b=6.

- Cutting parallel to a (dividing b): Suppose we cut b into 3 and 3. Then we have two rectangles of 2x3.

- From these two 2x3 rectangles, we can arrange them side by side to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

- Hence, in this case, it's possible to form a new rectangle.

- Another example: a=3, b=2.

- Since b is even, cut b into 1 and 1. Now, we have two rectangles of 3x1.

- From these, we can arrange them side by side to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x2.

- Hence, the program's logic seems to hold here.

**Edge Cases:**

- **a=1, b=1:** Both odd. Cannot be cut into smaller integer-sided rectangles. So, cannot form a new rectangle. Program outputs "No", which is correct.

- **a=2, b=1:** a is even. Can cut a into 1 and 1. Have two 1x1 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x1 (considering rotations). So, is this considered a different rectangle? According to the problem, rotations don't count as different. So, in this case, even though we can cut and rearrange, the resulting rectangle is not different from the original. Hence, the program should output "No", but according to the program, since a is even, it outputs "Yes". This seems incorrect.

Wait a minute, in the example provided in the problem description, for 2x1, it's mentioned that another rectangle cannot be formed, and the program should output "No". However, according to the program's logic, since a=2 is even, it would output "Yes", which contradicts the expected behavior.

**Potential Counterexample:**

- **Test Case:** a=2, b=1

- **Expected Output:** "No"

- **Program Output:** "Yes"

This indicates that the program's logic is flawed because in this case, even though a is even, Bob cannot form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

**Further Analysis:**

Let's see why in this specific case, the program's logic fails.

- When a=2, b=1:

- Cut parallel to a: divide b into two parts, say 0.5 and 0.5, but since sides must be integers, we cannot cut b=1 into two integers summing to 1 unless both are 0 or 1, which isn't feasible for non-zero areas.

- Cut parallel to b: divide a into two integers, say 1 and 1.

- Now, we have two rectangles of 1x1.

- Arranging them, we can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x1 rectangle.

- Hence, no new rectangle is formed.

Therefore, the program should output "No" for this case, but according to the logic, it outputs "Yes".

This suggests that the program's logic is incorrect because it doesn't account for cases where, even though one dimension is even, the resulting rearrangement doesn't produce a new rectangle.

**Additional Considerations:**

- The problem allows rotating and moving the pieces but considers rotations of rectangles as the same.

- Hence, forming a rectangle that is a rotation of the original shouldn't be counted as a new rectangle.

- The program needs to ensure that the new rectangle formed is different from the original, not just that it's possible to rearrange the pieces.

**Alternative Approach:**

To correctly solve this problem, we need a more thorough analysis.

1. **Cutting Parallel to Side a:**

- Divide b into two integers, say b1 and b2, such that b1 + b2 = b.

- After cutting, we have two rectangles of dimensions a × b1 and a × b2.

- We can rotate these rectangles, so their dimensions become a × b1, b1 × a, a × b2, or b2 × a.

- To form a new rectangle, we need to arrange these two rectangles such that their combined area is a*b, and the resulting rectangle has different dimensions from the original, considering rotations.

2. **Cutting Parallel to Side b:**

- Similarly, divide a into two integers, say a1 and a2, such that a1 + a2 = a.

- After cutting, we have two rectangles of dimensions a1 × b and a2 × b.

- Again, rotating them, their dimensions can be a1 × b, b × a1, a2 × b, or b × a2.

- Arrange these to form a new rectangle with different dimensions from the original.

**Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**

- After cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle should have dimensions that are not equal to the original dimensions or their rotations.

- For example, if the original rectangle is a × b, then the new rectangle should not be a × b or b × a.

- The total area remains a*b.

- So, we need to check if there exists a pair of integers (c, d) such that c*d = a*b, and (c, d) is not equal to (a, b) or (b, a), and c and d are achievable by arranging the two smaller rectangles.

This seems complex, but perhaps there's a smarter way to determine if such a rearrangement is possible.

**Simpler Insight:**

Looking back at the program's logic, it seems to suggest that if at least one of a or b is even, then it's possible to form a new rectangle.

However, as seen in the counterexample (a=2, b=1), this isn't always true.

Perhaps there's a different condition that the program is trying to capture.

**Revisiting the Problem:**

Let's consider the mathematical properties.

- The area of the original rectangle is a*b.

- To form a new rectangle, we need to find two integers c and d such that c*d = a*b, and (c, d) is different from (a, b) and (b, a).

- Additionally, we need to ensure that this new rectangle can be formed by rearranging the two smaller rectangles obtained from the cut.

- The key is to check if there exists such a pair (c, d) where c and d are achievable by combining the two smaller rectangles in some way.

**Necessary and Sufficient Condition:**

After some thought, it seems that the necessary and sufficient condition is that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is greater than 1.

- If GCD(a, b) > 1, then it's possible to cut and rearrange the rectangles to form a new one.

- If GCD(a, b) = 1, it's not possible.

Wait, but in the example where a=2 and b=6, GCD(2,6)=2 >1, and it's possible to form a new rectangle.

In the case where a=2 and b=1, GCD(2,1)=1, and it's not possible to form a new rectangle.

This seems to align with the program's logic because if at least one of a or b is even, then GCD(a,b) is at least 1, but it's not sufficient on its own.

Wait, no. GCD(a,b) being greater than 1 ensures that a and b share a common factor other than 1, which might allow for certain cuts and rearrangements.

But in the program, it's checking if either a or b is even, which is different from GCD being greater than 1.

For example, a=3 and b=9: GCD(3,9)=3 >1, and a is odd, b is odd, but according to the program, it would output "No" since both are odd, which might not be correct.

Wait, but in this case, is it possible to form a new rectangle?

- Original rectangle: 3x9

- Cut parallel to a: divide b into two parts, say 3 and 6.

- Have two rectangles: 3x3 and 3x6.

- Arrange them to form a new rectangle: for example, place them side by side to form a 3x9, which is the same as the original.

- Alternatively, rotate them: 3x3 becomes 3x3, 3x6 becomes 6x3.

- Arranging them differently: place the 3x3 and 6x3 rectangles to form a new rectangle of, say, 9x3, which is the same as the original 3x9 considering rotations.

- So, in this case, it seems like no new rectangle can be formed.

Hence, even though GCD(3,9)=3>1, it's not possible to form a new rectangle.

This contradicts the earlier assumption that GCD(a,b)>1 is a condition for forming a new rectangle.

So, perhaps there's another approach.

**Deeper Analysis:**

Let's consider that to form a new rectangle, the aspect ratio should change.

- The original aspect ratio is a/b.

- To form a new rectangle with different dimensions, the aspect ratio should be different from a/b and b/a.

- However, since rotations don't count as different, we only need to consider aspect ratios that are not equal to a/b or b/a.

- But this is not straightforward because the new rectangle is formed by rearranging two smaller rectangles.

**Considering the Area:**

- The area of the new rectangle must be a*b.

- So, any possible new rectangle must have dimensions c and d such that c*d = a*b.

- Additionally, (c, d) should not be equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

- The question is whether such c and d exist, and whether the two smaller rectangles can be arranged to form this new rectangle.

**Condition for Existence of New Rectangle:**

- If a and b share a common factor greater than 1, then it might be possible to cut and rearrange the rectangles to form a new one.

- However, as seen in the earlier example where a=3 and b=9, even though GCD is 3, it's not possible to form a new rectangle.

- Hence, GCD being greater than 1 is not a sufficient condition.

- Perhaps a more precise condition is needed.

**Alternative Approach:**

Let's think in terms of possible cuts and arrangements.

1. **Cutting Parallel to Side a:**

- Divide b into b1 and b2, where b1 + b2 = b.

- After cutting, we have two rectangles: a × b1 and a × b2.

- We can rotate these rectangles, so their dimensions become a × b1 or b1 × a, and a × b2 or b2 × a.

- To form a new rectangle, we need to arrange these two rectangles such that their combined area is a*b, and the resulting rectangle has dimensions c and d, where c*d = a*b, and (c, d) is not equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

2. **Cutting Parallel to Side b:**

- Divide a into a1 and a2, where a1 + a2 = a.

- After cutting, we have two rectangles: a1 × b and a2 × b.

- Rotating them, their dimensions become a1 × b or b × a1, and a2 × b or b × a2.

- Again, arrange them to form a new rectangle with c*d = a*b, and (c, d) not equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

**Possible Combinations:**

- If we arrange two rectangles side by side, their widths add up.

- If we arrange them one above the other, their heights add up.

- Rotations allow for flexibility in arranging them.

**General Condition:**

After considering various possibilities, it seems that the program's logic might be too simplistic.

A more accurate condition might involve checking if either a or b is divisible by 2, but with additional constraints to handle edge cases like a=2, b=1.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition should be that both a and b are even, or one of them is even and greater than 2.

But this needs further verification.

**Revisiting the Program's Logic:**

Given that the program checks if either a or b is even, and outputs "Yes" in that case, and "No" otherwise, and considering the counterexample where a=2 and b=1 should output "No" but the program outputs "Yes", it's clear that the program's logic is flawed.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**

The program does not correctly determine whether Bob can form another rectangle from the a×b rectangle in all cases. Therefore, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{False}} \]
