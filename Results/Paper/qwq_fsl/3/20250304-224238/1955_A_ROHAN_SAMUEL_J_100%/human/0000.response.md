Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. I need to determine if the program meets the requirements for every possible input case. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I have to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. The problem is about buying yogurts with a special promotion: you can buy two yogurts for a price `b` burles, instead of buying them individually at `a` burles each. Maxim wants to buy exactly `n` yogurts, and I need to find the minimum amount of money he needs to spend.

The program provided is a function that processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`, and then calculates the minimum cost based on the given values.

Let's look at the program step by step.

The function `func` is defined to handle multiple test cases. It starts by reading an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.

The logic inside the loop seems to handle two main cases based on whether `n` is odd or even.

1. **If `n` is odd:**

- It checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them with the promotion, i.e., if `2 * a < b`.

- If `2 * a < b`, it means it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually, so it calculates the total cost as `a * n`.

- Otherwise, it buys as many pairs as possible with the promotion and one yogurt individually, i.e., `(n // 2) * b + a`.

2. **If `n` is even:**

- Again, it checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them with the promotion, i.e., if `2 * a < b`.

- If `2 * a < b`, it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually, so it calculates the total cost as `a * n`.

- Otherwise, it buys all yogurts in pairs with the promotion, i.e., `(n // 2) * b`.

At first glance, this seems logical, but I need to verify if this covers all possible scenarios.

Let me think about different cases:

- **Case 1:** `n` is even, and `2 * a < b`. In this case, buying individually is cheaper, so buying all yogurts individually makes sense.

- **Case 2:** `n` is even, and `2 * a >= b`. Here, buying in pairs is equal or cheaper, so buying all in pairs is optimal.

- **Case 3:** `n` is odd, and `2 * a < b`. Buying individually is cheaper, so buying all individually should be optimal.

- **Case 4:** `n` is odd, and `2 * a >= b`. In this case, buying as many pairs as possible and one individual yogurt would be optimal.

Wait a minute, in the odd case, the program buys `(n // 2)` pairs with the promotion and one yogurt individually. But is there a better way?

Let me consider an example:

Suppose `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`.

According to the program:

- `n` is odd.

- `2 * a = 10`, which is greater than `b = 9`.

- So, it buys one pair with the promotion (`b = 9`) and one yogurt individually (`a = 5`), totaling `9 + 5 = 14`.

But, is there a better way? Maybe buying all three individually would cost `3 * 5 = 15`, which is more than `14`, so the program's approach is better.

Another example from the note:

- `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`.

- `2 * a = 10`, which is less than `b = 11`.

- So, it's cheaper to buy individually: `3 * 5 = 15`.

- But, according to the note, buying two with promotion (`11`) and one individually (`5`) would total `16`, which is more than `15`. So, the program's approach is correct here.

Wait, but the note says: "In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5."

Wait, but in the program, when `2 * a < b`, it buys all individually, which is correct in this case.

Another example:

- `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`.

- `n` is even.

- `2 * a = 10`, which is less than `b = 11`.

- So, it buys all individually: `4 * 5 = 20`.

- But, is there a better way? Buying two pairs with promotion would cost `2 * 11 = 22`, which is more than `20`. So, individual buying is better.

Seems correct.

But let's think of another scenario.

Suppose `n = 3`, `a = 3`, `b = 5`.

- `2 * a = 6`, which is greater than `b = 5`.

- So, buy one pair with promotion (`5`) and one individually (`3`), totaling `8`.

- Alternatively, buy all three individually: `9`, which is more.

- Another option: buy one pair with promotion (`5`) and use another promotion for the third yogurt? But the promotion is only for two yogurts.

- So, no, the program's approach is correct.

Another scenario:

- `n = 5`, `a = 4`, `b = 7`.

- `n` is odd.

- `2 * a = 8`, which is greater than `b = 7`.

- So, buy two pairs with promotion (`2 * 7 = 14`) and one individually (`4`), totaling `18`.

- Alternatively, buy all individually: `5 * 4 = 20`.

- Another option: buy one pair with promotion (`7`) and three individually (`3 * 4 = 12`), totaling `19`, which is worse than `18`.

So, the program's approach seems correct.

Wait, but what if `b` is less than `2 * a`, but greater than `a`.

For example:

- `n = 3`, `a = 2`, `b = 3`.

- `2 * a = 4`, which is greater than `b = 3`.

- So, buy one pair with promotion (`3`) and one individually (`2`), totaling `5`.

- Alternatively, buy all individually: `6`, which is more.

- Another option: is there a way to buy three together with promotion? But the promotion is only for two yogurts.

- So, the program's approach is correct.

Another edge case:

- `n = 1`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`.

- `n` is odd.

- `2 * a = 10`, which is greater than `b = 9`.

- But since `n = 1`, it buys zero pairs and one individually, which costs `5`.

- Is there a better way? No, since the promotion is for two yogurts.

- So, correct.

Another edge case:

- `n = 0`, but according to the problem, `n` is at least 1, so no need to handle `n = 0`.

One more case:

- `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`.

- `n` is even.

- `2 * a = 10`, which is greater than `b = 9`.

- So, buy one pair with promotion (`9`), total cost `9`.

- Alternatively, buy two individually (`10`), which is more.

- So, correct.

Wait, but according to the program, for even `n`, if `2 * a < b`, buy individually; else, buy in pairs.

In this case, `2 * a > b`, so buy in pairs, which is correct.

But what if `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 8`.

- `n` is even.

- `2 * a = 10`, which is greater than `b = 8`.

- So, buy one pair with promotion (`8`), total cost `8`.

- But, buying individually would cost `10`, which is more.

- So, buying in pairs is still better, even though `2 * a > b`.

Wait, no, according to the program, if `2 * a < b`, buy individually; else, buy in pairs.

In this case, `2 * a > b`, so buy in pairs, which is correct.

Wait, but in the program, for even `n`, if `2 * a < b`, buy individually; else, buy in pairs.

Yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but in this example, `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 8`.

- `2 * a = 10 > b = 8`, so buy in pairs: `8`.

- Which is correct, as buying individually would cost `10`.

Seems correct.

Another case:

- `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`.

- `n` is even.

- `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`.

- So, buy two pairs with promotion: `2 * 9 = 18`.

- But, buying individually would cost `4 * 5 = 20`.

- So, buying in pairs is better.

Correct.

What if `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 10`.

- `n` is even.

- `2 * a = 10 == b = 10`.

- So, it's indifferent between buying individually or in pairs.

- The program will buy in pairs: `2 * 10 = 20`.

- Buying individually: `4 * 5 = 20`.

- Same cost, which is fine.

Now, let's consider the program's logic again.

In the odd case, it buys `(n // 2)` pairs with promotion and one individually.

But is there a scenario where buying `(n // 2 - 1)` pairs with promotion and three individually would be cheaper?

Wait, let's think about `n = 3`.

In the earlier examples, it seems buying one pair with promotion and one individually is better.

But what if buying three individually is cheaper?

Wait, in the third test case of the example, it says:

"In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5."

Wait, in that case, `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`.

- `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`.

- So, according to the program, it should buy all individually: `15`.

- Buying two with promotion (`11`) and one individually (`5`) would total `16`, which is more than `15`.

- So, the program's approach is correct.

Another scenario:

- `n = 5`, `a = 3`, `b = 5`.

- `n` is odd.

- `2 * a = 6 > b = 5`.

- So, buy `(n // 2) = 2` pairs with promotion (`2 * 5 = 10`) and one individually (`3`), totaling `13`.

- Alternatively, buy all individually: `15`.

- Another option: buy one pair with promotion (`5`) and three individually (`9`), totaling `14`, which is worse than `13`.

- So, correct.

Wait, but what if `n = 5`, `a = 3`, `b = 6`.

- `n` is odd.

- `2 * a = 6 == b = 6`.

- So, it's indifferent.

- The program buys `(n // 2) = 2` pairs with promotion (`12`) and one individually (`3`), totaling `15`.

- Buying all individually: `15`.

- Buying one pair with promotion (`6`) and three individually (`9`), totaling `15`.

- All same, so correct.

Another scenario:

- `n = 3`, `a = 4`, `b = 7`.

- `n` is odd.

- `2 * a = 8 > b = 7`.

- So, buy one pair with promotion (`7`) and one individually (`4`), totaling `11`.

- Buying all individually: `12`.

- Another option: buy one pair with promotion and one individually, which is `11`.

- So, correct.

Wait, but what if `n = 3`, `a = 4`, `b = 10`.

- `n` is odd.

- `2 * a = 8 < b = 10`.

- So, buy all individually: `12`.

- Buying one pair with promotion (`10`) and one individually (`4`), totaling `14`, which is worse.

- So, correct.

Wait, but what if `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 10`.

- `n` is even.

- `2 * a = 8 < b = 10`.

- So, buy all individually: `16`.

- Buying two pairs with promotion: `20`, which is worse.

- So, correct.

Another scenario:

- `n = 6`, `a = 3`, `b = 5`.

- `n` is even.

- `2 * a = 6 > b = 5`.

- So, buy three pairs with promotion: `15`.

- Buying individually: `18`.

- Another option: buy two pairs with promotion (`10`) and two individually (`6`), totaling `16`, which is worse than `15`.

- So, correct.

Wait, but what if `n = 6`, `a = 3`, `b = 7`.

- `n` is even.

- `2 * a = 6 < b = 7`.

- So, buy all individually: `18`.

- Buying three pairs with promotion: `21`, which is worse.

- Another option: buy two pairs with promotion (`14`) and two individually (`6`), totaling `20`, which is worse than `18`.

- So, correct.

Seems like the program's logic holds for these cases.

But let's think differently.

Suppose `n = 4`, `a = 2`, `b = 3`.

- `n` is even.

- `2 * a = 4 > b = 3`.

- So, buy two pairs with promotion: `6`.

- Buying individually: `8`.

- Another option: buy one pair with promotion (`3`) and two individually (`4`), totaling `7`, which is worse than `6`.

- So, correct.

Another scenario:

- `n = 5`, `a = 2`, `b = 3`.

- `n` is odd.

- `2 * a = 4 > b = 3`.

- So, buy two pairs with promotion (`6`) and one individually (`2`), totaling `8`.

- Buying individually: `10`.

- Another option: buy one pair with promotion (`3`) and three individually (`6`), totaling `9`, which is worse than `8`.

- So, correct.

Wait, but what if `n = 5`, `a = 2`, `b = 4`.

- `n` is odd.

- `2 * a = 4 == b = 4`.

- So, it's indifferent.

- The program buys two pairs with promotion (`8`) and one individually (`2`), totaling `10`.

- Buying individually: `10`.

- Buying one pair with promotion (`4`) and three individually (`6`), totaling `10`.

- All same, correct.

Another scenario:

- `n = 3`, `a = 1`, `b = 2`.

- `n` is odd.

- `2 * a = 2 == b = 2`.

- So, it's indifferent.

- The program buys one pair with promotion (`2`) and one individually (`1`), totaling `3`.

- Buying individually: `3`.

- Another option: buy one pair with promotion and one individually, totaling `3`.

- Correct.

Wait, but what if `n = 3`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`.

- `n` is odd.

- `2 * a = 2 > b = 1`.

- So, buy one pair with promotion (`1`) and one individually (`1`), totaling `2`.

- Buying individually: `3`.

- Another option: buy one pair with promotion and one individually, totaling `2`.

- So, correct.

Seems like the program handles this correctly.

But let's consider `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`.

- `n` is even.

- `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`.

- So, buy one pair with promotion: `9`.

- Buying individually: `10`.

- Correct.

Another case:

- `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 10`.

- `n` is even.

- `2 * a = 10 == b = 10`.

- So, buy one pair with promotion: `10`.

- Buying individually: `10`.

- Correct.

Wait, but according to the program, for even `n`, if `2 * a < b`, buy individually; else, buy in pairs.

In this case, `2 * a == b`, so it buys in pairs, which is correct.

Another scenario:

- `n = 1`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`.

- `n` is odd.

- `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`.

- So, buy zero pairs and one individually: `5`.

- Correct.

Edge case:

- `n = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`.

- `n` is odd.

- `2 * a = 2 > b = 1`.

- Buy zero pairs and one individually: `1`.

- Correct.

Another edge case:

- `n = 0`, but `n` is at least 1, so no need to handle.

Wait, the problem says `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, so `n` is at least 1.

Seems like the program handles all these cases correctly.

But let's think about larger `n`.

- `n = 100`, `a = 30`, `b = 50`.

- `n` is even.

- `2 * a = 60 > b = 50`.

- So, buy 50 pairs with promotion: `2500`.

- Buying individually: `3000`.

- Correct.

Another large `n`:

- `n = 99`, `a = 30`, `b = 50`.

- `n` is odd.

- `2 * a = 60 > b = 50`.

- So, buy 49 pairs with promotion (`2450`) and one individually (`30`), totaling `2480`.

- Buying individually: `2970`.

- Another option: buy 49 pairs with promotion and one individually: `2480`.

- Correct.

Seems like the program's logic is sound.

But wait, perhaps there's a scenario where buying a certain number of pairs and the remaining individually isn't the optimal strategy.

Is there any way that buying a different combination could be cheaper?

I think not, because the program's approach minimizes the cost by maximizing the use of the promotion when it's beneficial and falling back to individual purchases when they are cheaper.

Given that, I can't find any case where the program doesn't work as expected.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]

**Explanation**

The program correctly handles both even and odd numbers of yogurts by comparing the cost of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs with the promotion. For even numbers, it chooses the cheaper option between buying all yogurts individually or in pairs. For odd numbers, it buys as many pairs as possible and purchases the remaining yogurt individually, ensuring the minimum cost is achieved in all scenarios.
