Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible input case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

First, I need to understand the problem description fully. It's about Kirill gathering mushrooms under a Wise Oak to make a magical elixir. There are n mushrooms, each with a magic power v_i. Kirill wants to pick mushrooms to make an elixir, and the strength of the elixir is calculated as the product of the number of mushrooms in it and the minimum magic power among those mushrooms.

However, there's a twist: there's a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n, and if Kirill picks only k mushrooms, the magic power of mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} becomes 0. He won't use mushrooms with zero magic power in his elixir. My task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew the elixir of maximum possible strength, and among all such options, choose the one with the minimum number of mushrooms.

The program provided is supposed to solve this problem. I need to verify if this program correctly computes the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed for that strength, for each test case.

Let me try to understand the program step by step.

The program starts by importing necessary modules: math, bisect, and typing. It defines a generic type T and a class SortedMultiset that seems to implement a multiset data structure with sorted properties. This class has various methods like add, discard, lt, le, gt, ge, etc., which are common operations on sorted sets.

In the main function, it reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads n (number of mushrooms), the list v of their magic powers, and the permutation p.

Then, it constructs a list a where a[i] = -v[p[i]-1]. So, it's negating the magic powers of mushrooms in the order specified by the permutation p.

It creates an instance of SortedMultiset with this list a.

Then, it initializes ans to -1 and idx to 1.

It iterates over i from 0 to (n // 2), calculating x = (i + 1) * -r[i], where r is the SortedMultiset. If x is greater than ans, it updates ans and idx to i + 1. After each iteration, it discards the i-th element from the SortedMultiset.

Finally, it prints ans and idx.

Hmm, this seems a bit abstract. Let me try to understand what's happening.

First, the permutation p determines which mushrooms have their magic power set to zero based on how many mushrooms Kirill picks. If he picks k mushrooms, then the first k-1 elements in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero.

So, to choose k mushrooms, the magic powers of p[0] to p[k-2] are set to zero, and Kirill won't use those in his elixir.

He wants to pick k mushrooms such that the strength of the elixir, which is k multiplied by the minimum magic power among the picked mushrooms (excluding those with zero magic power), is maximized. Among all such choices, he wants the one with the smallest k.

The program seems to be trying to maximize k * min(v), but I need to make sure it's handling the permutation and the zeroing out correctly.

Let me think about how to approach this problem correctly.

Given that picking k mushrooms zeros out the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p, Kirill needs to pick k mushrooms, excluding the first k-1 in the permutation, meaning only the k-th mushroom in the permutation keeps its original magic power, and the rest are zero.

Wait, no. Let's read carefully: "the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1} will become 0". So, if he picks k mushrooms, the mushrooms at positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero.

But he can only use mushrooms with non-zero magic power in his elixir.

So, in the elixir, he can only include mushrooms that are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but he has to pick exactly k mushrooms, and among those k, the ones at positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Let's think differently. Suppose Kirill picks a set of k mushrooms. Among these k mushrooms, the first k-1 in the permutation order have their magic power set to zero. So, in the elixir, only the last mushroom in the permutation order among the k picked mushrooms has its original magic power; the others have zero magic power.

But Kirill won't use mushrooms with zero magic power in his elixir. So, effectively, only the k-th mushroom in the permutation order has its original magic power; the others are zero and not used.

Wait, that can't be right because if he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 in the permutation have their magic power set to zero, but he can choose which k mushrooms to pick.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the permutation p as the order in which Kirill picks the mushrooms.

Suppose p is the order in which he picks the mushrooms. So, p[0] is the first mushroom he picks, p[1] is the second, and so on.

If he picks k mushrooms, then the first k-1 mushrooms he picks have their magic power set to zero, and the k-th mushroom he picks retains its magic power.

But he can choose any k mushrooms, and the permutation p defines the order in which he picks them.

Wait, but the problem says: "If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, …, p_{k−1} will become 0."

So, p is the order in which he picks the mushrooms.

Wait, but p is a permutation from 1 to n, representing the indices of the mushrooms.

So, p[0] is the first mushroom he picks, p[1] is the second, and so on.

If he picks k mushrooms, then the first k-1 mushrooms he picks (p[0] to p[k-2]) have their magic power set to zero, and the k-th mushroom he picks (p[k-1]) retains its magic power.

But, the problem says: "Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order."

Wait, but the permutation p is given, and it's fixed. It's not that Kirill chooses the order; the order is given.

Wait, no, the problem says: "The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation of numbers p from 1 to n. If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, …, p_{k−1} will become 0."

So, the permutation p is fixed, and it determines which mushrooms have their magic power set to zero when he picks k mushrooms.

So, for a given k, if he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero, and the remaining mushrooms (from p[k-1] to p[n-1]) retain their original magic power.

But, he can choose which k mushrooms to pick, meaning he can choose any subset of k mushrooms, and for each such subset, the first k-1 in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, I'm getting tangled here.

Let me try to rephrase.

Given a permutation p of mushroom indices, when Kirill picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in the order specified by p have their magic power set to zero, and only the k-th mushroom in that order retains its original magic power.

Then, Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power in his elixir.

So, for a chosen k, the only mushroom that retains its original magic power is the k-th one in the permutation p.

Therefore, the elixir's strength would be 1 * v[p[k-1]], because only one mushroom is effectively contributing to the elixir.

Wait, that seems off because the problem mentions that he picks k mushrooms, but only the k-th one retains its magic power, and the rest are zero, which he doesn't use.

So, it seems like for each k, the elixir would only include the k-th mushroom, and thus the strength would be 1 * v[p[k-1]].

But that seems too simplistic, and the provided program does something different.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Let's look at the example:

Input:

6

9 8 14

3 2 1

1 4 2 3 5

Output:

16 2

9 3

8 2

20 2

5 1

20 2

In the first test case, n=3, v=[9,8,14], p=[3,2,1]

According to my earlier logic, if he picks k=1 mushroom, the first 0 mushrooms have their magic power set to zero (none). So, he picks one mushroom, say p[0]=3, which is mushroom 3 with v=14. So, elixir strength is 1*14=14.

If he picks k=2 mushrooms, the first k-1=1 mushroom, p[0]=3, has its magic power set to zero. So, mushroom 3 has v=0, and he picks another mushroom, say p[1]=2 (mushroom 2 with v=8). But he won't use mushroom 3 since its v=0. So, elixir strength is 1*8=8.

If he picks k=3 mushrooms, the first 2 mushrooms, p[0]=3 and p[1]=2, have their v set to zero. So, mushrooms 3 and 2 have v=0, and he picks p[2]=1 (mushroom 1 with v=9). So, elixir strength is 1*9=9.

But according to the sample output, for the first test case, it's 16 2, which suggests a different calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"As soon as everyone in the camp fell asleep, Kirill sneaked out of the tent and went to the Wise Oak to gather mushrooms.

It is known that there are n mushrooms growing under the Oak, each of which has magic power v_i. Kirill really wants to make a magical elixir of maximum strength from the mushrooms.

The strength of the elixir is equal to the product of the number of mushrooms in it and the minimum magic power among these mushrooms. To prepare the elixir, Kirill will sequentially pick one mushroom growing under the Oak. Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order.

However, it's not that simple. The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation of numbers p from 1 to n. If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, …, p_{k-1} will become 0. Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir.

Your task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew the elixir of maximum possible strength. However, Kirill is a little scared to stay near the oak for too long, so out of all the suitable options for gathering mushrooms, he asks you to find the one with the minimum number of mushrooms."

So, the permutation p defines the order in which Kirill picks the mushrooms. If he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 mushrooms in the order p have their magic power set to zero, and only the k-th mushroom retains its original magic power.

But, Kirill can choose any k mushrooms; he can select any subset of k mushrooms, and the permutation p defines which ones have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, no. The problem says: "If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, …, p_{k-1} will become 0."

So, for a chosen k, if he picks exactly k mushrooms, the first k-1 in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero.

Then, he can choose which k mushrooms to pick, meaning he can choose any subset of k mushrooms, and for each such subset, the first k-1 in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, I'm still confused.

Let me consider that p is the order in which he picks the mushrooms. So, p[0] is the first picked, p[1] is the second, and so on.

If he picks k mushrooms, then the first k-1 mushrooms he picks have their magic power set to zero, and the k-th mushroom he picks retains its magic power.

But, he can choose any k mushrooms, meaning he can choose any subset of k mushrooms and define the order based on p.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that p is fixed, and for any k mushrooms he picks, the first k-1 in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that p defines the order in which mushrooms are considered for zeroing out their magic power when he picks k mushrooms.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that p is the order in which mushrooms are picked, and when he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 have their magic power set to zero, and the k-th has its magic power retained.

But, he can choose any k mushrooms, meaning he can choose any subset of k mushrooms, and the first k-1 in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate over all possible k from 1 to n, and for each k, determine which mushrooms have their magic power set to zero, and then choose the k-th mushroom to have its original magic power.

But, this seems too vague.

Let me consider the first test case again.

n=3, v=[9,8,14], p=[3,2,1]

According to the sample output, the maximum elixir strength is 16 with 2 mushrooms.

How is that possible?

If he picks k=2 mushrooms, the first k-1=1 mushroom has its magic power set to zero. According to p, p[0]=3, so mushroom 3 has v=0.

Then, he picks another mushroom, say mushroom 1 with v=9.

So, his elixir would be made from mushroom 1 with v=9, and strength is 1*9=9.

But the sample output is 16, which is 2*8=16, suggesting he picks mushrooms 1 and 2.

Wait, but in this case, p[0]=3 is set to zero, so mushroom 3 has v=0.

He picks mushrooms 1 and 2, but mushroom 3 is already set to zero, which doesn't affect his elixir since he's not picking mushroom 3.

Wait, no, the problem says: "If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, …, p_{k-1} will become 0."

So, if he picks k=2 mushrooms, the first k-1=1 mushroom, which is p[0]=3, has its magic power set to zero.

Then, he picks mushrooms 1 and 2, but mushroom 3 is set to zero, which doesn't affect his elixir since he's not picking mushroom 3.

So, his elixir would be made from mushrooms 1 and 2, with v=9 and v=8, minimum is 8, strength is 2*8=16.

Wait, that matches the sample output.

So, my earlier misunderstanding was that I thought only the k-th mushroom retains its magic power, but actually, all the k mushrooms retain their magic power except for p_1 to p_{k-1}, which have their magic power set to zero.

Wait, but in this case, p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero, but he doesn't use mushrooms with zero magic power in his elixir.

Wait, no, he doesn't use mushrooms with zero magic power.

So, in the first test case, when he picks k=2 mushrooms, p_1=p[0]=3 is set to zero.

Then, he picks mushrooms 1 and 2, but mushroom 3 is set to zero, but since he didn't pick mushroom 3, it doesn't affect his elixir.

So, his elixir is made from mushrooms 1 and 2, with v=9 and v=8, minimum is 8, strength is 16.

Wait, but according to the problem, "the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, …, p_{k-1} will become 0", and "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir."

But in this case, p_1=p[0]=3 is set to zero, and he picks mushrooms 1 and 2, which are not set to zero.

So, his elixir is made from mushrooms 1 and 2, with v=9 and v=8, minimum is 8, strength is 16.

That matches the sample output.

So, perhaps the way to maximize the strength is to pick k mushrooms, set the first k-1 in the permutation p to zero, and then choose the k-th mushroom and any others that aren't set to zero.

Wait, no, in the first test case, he picks k=2 mushrooms, sets p_1=3 to zero, and picks mushrooms 1 and 2, which are not set to zero.

So, his elixir is made from mushrooms 1 and 2, with v=9 and v=8, minimum 8, strength 16.

Similarly, for k=1, he picks one mushroom, say mushroom 1, sets none to zero, elixir strength is 1*9=9.

For k=3, he picks three mushrooms, sets p_1 and p_2=3 and 2 to zero, picks mushrooms 1,2,3, but mushrooms 2 and 3 have v=0, so only mushroom 1 with v=9, strength is 1*9=9.

Hence, the maximum strength is 16 with k=2.

So, the key is that when he picks k mushrooms, the first k-1 in the permutation p have their magic power set to zero, and he can choose which k mushrooms to pick, but he won't use the ones with zero magic power.

Therefore, to maximize the strength, he needs to pick k mushrooms such that the mushrooms he picks have as high as possible minimum magic power, while maximizing k.

But it's a trade-off because increasing k increases the number of mushrooms but also increases the number of mushrooms set to zero.

So, it's tricky.

Now, looking back at the provided program, it seems to be trying to maximize k * min(v), but I need to verify if it's doing it correctly.

Looking at the program:

It reads t, n, v, p for each test case.

Then, it constructs a list a where a[i] = -v[p[i]-1].

Then, it creates a SortedMultiset r with a.

Then, it iterates i from 0 to (n+1)//2, calculates x = (i+1) * -r[i], updates ans and idx if x > ans, and discards a[i] from r.

Finally, it prints ans and idx.

I need to understand what this is doing.

First, a[i] = -v[p[i]-1], so it's negating the magic powers of mushrooms in the order specified by p.

Then, it's using a SortedMultiset to keep track of these negated values.

In the loop, it calculates x = (i+1) * -r[i], which is (i+1) times the i-th smallest negated value, which is equivalent to (i+1) times the (n - i)-th largest original value.

Wait, negating and taking the i-th element in a sorted set.

This seems like an attempt to select the i-th largest magic power, since negating makes the largest positive values become the smallest negative values.

So, r[i] is the i-th smallest in the negated list, which corresponds to the (n - i)-th largest in the original list.

So, x = (i+1) * -r[i] is (i+1) times the (n - i)-th largest original magic power.

Then, it updates ans and idx if x > ans.

Also, it discards a[i] from r after each iteration.

I need to see if this logic correctly maximizes k * min(v).

Wait, perhaps the idea is to choose k mushrooms, set the first k-1 to zero, and pick the k-th mushroom's magic power as the minimum.

Wait, but in the first test case, for k=2, it should pick the second largest magic power, which is 8, and strength is 2*8=16.

Similarly, for k=1, it's 1*14=14.

For k=3, it's 3*9=27, but in reality, as per earlier analysis, k=3 would have only one mushroom with v=9, so strength is 1*9=9.

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after setting k-1 mushrooms to zero, the remaining mushrooms have their original magic powers, and he picks the k-th mushroom with the highest magic power.

Wait, no, I think I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for a chosen k, the first k-1 mushrooms in p have their magic power set to zero, and he picks k mushrooms, including the k-th mushroom in p with its original magic power.

Then, in his elixir, he can use the k-th mushroom and any other mushrooms that are not set to zero.

Wait, but the problem says he won't use mushrooms with zero magic power.

So, for k mushrooms, the first k-1 in p have their magic power set to zero, and the k-th has its original magic power.

Then, he can choose to include the k-th mushroom and any others that are not set to zero.

Wait, but the others are set to zero because they are among the first k-1
