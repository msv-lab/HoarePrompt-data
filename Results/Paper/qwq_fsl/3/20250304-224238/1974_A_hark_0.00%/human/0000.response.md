Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing application icons of two different sizes on a phone's desktop. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells per screen.

There are two types of icons:

1. 1x1 icons, which take up one cell each.

2. 2x2 icons, which take up a 2x2 square of four cells.

The problem is to find the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons without overlapping.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Each screen has 15 cells. A 1x1 icon uses one cell, and a 2x2 icon uses four cells. However, because the screen is a 5x3 grid, placing a 2x2 icon restricts the positions where other icons can be placed due to the grid layout.

Looking at the example outputs, for certain combinations of x (1x1 icons) and y (2x2 icons), the required number of screens is given. My task is to ensure that the provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens for any valid input within the given constraints.

Let me analyze the program step by step.

The program consists of three functions:

1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function returns the minimum of two numbers, a or b.

2. `func_2()`: This function reads input values x and y, performs some calculations, and prints the result.

3. `func_3()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2()` for each test case.

Since `func_1` isn't used anywhere in the provided code, I'll focus on `func_2` and `func_3`.

Looking at `func_2()`, it seems to handle the logic for calculating the number of screens needed for a given x and y.

Let's break down `func_2()`:

- It reads two integers, x and y, from input.

- If both x and y are greater than 0:

- It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of y divided by 2. Since each screen can have up to 2 2x2 icons (because 2x2 icons take 4 cells, and 15 cells per screen can fit up to 3 2x2 icons, but considering the grid layout, only 2 can be placed without overlapping).

- Then, it calculates x adjusted by subtracting `bxsfory * 15 - y * 4`. This seems unclear. It's subtracting the product of `bxsfory` and 15, then subtracting `y * 4`. I need to verify if this logic correctly accounts for the space taken by 2x2 icons.

- Then, `bxsfory1` is calculated as 0 if the adjusted x is less than or equal to 0, else it's the ceiling of adjusted x divided by 15 plus 1.

- Finally, it prints `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.

- If x is 0 and y is greater than 0:

- It prints the ceiling of y divided by 2.

- If x is greater than 0 and y is 0:

- It prints the ceiling of x divided by 15.

- If both x and y are 0:

- It prints 0.

This logic seems a bit convoluted, and I'm not entirely sure it correctly accounts for the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the screens.

Let me think about how to approach this problem correctly.

First, each screen has 15 cells.

A 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, but because of the grid layout, you can't just place them anywhere. In a 5x3 grid, you can place up to 2 non-overlapping 2x2 icons per screen.

Here's why:

- A 2x2 icon can be placed in positions where its top-left cell is in rows 1 to 4 and columns 1 to 2.

- So, possible positions for 2x2 icons are:

- Row 1, Column 1

- Row 1, Column 2

- Row 2, Column 1

- Row 2, Column 2

- Row 3, Column 1

- Row 3, Column 2

- Row 4, Column 1

- Row 4, Column 2

However, placing icons in certain positions may overlap. For example, placing one 2x2 icon at row 1, column 1 and another at row 2, column 2 would not overlap, but placing one at row 1, column 1 and another at row 2, column 1 would overlap.

So, to maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen without overlapping, we can place up to 2 such icons per screen.

Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, so 2 icons use 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

But, we need to ensure that the positions are such that the 1x1 icons don't overlap with the 2x2 icons.

Given that, per screen:

- Up to 2 2x2 icons can be placed, using 8 cells.

- The remaining 7 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, for y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons, we need to calculate the minimum number of screens required.

First, calculate the number of screens needed solely for the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons, the number of screens required for y 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

Then, calculate the number of cells used by these 2x2 icons: min(y, 2 * number_of_screens_for_y) * 4.

Then, calculate the remaining cells available for 1x1 icons: number_of_screens_for_y * 15 - cells_used_by_2x2_icons.

Then, calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed after accounting for the available cells: x - remaining_cells.

If x - remaining_cells > 0, then additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The number of additional screens needed is ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15).

Finally, the total number of screens is number_of_screens_for_y + additional_screens_for_remaining_x.

However, this needs to be refined to ensure that the positions of the icons don't overlap.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

So, per screen:

- Option 1: 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

- Option 2: 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons.

- Option 3: 0 2x2 icons and 15 1x1 icons.

But, considering the grid layout, placing 2 2x2 icons leaves only 7 cells for 1x1 icons, as the 2x2 icons occupy some overlapping cells in terms of rows and columns.

Wait, no. In a 5x3 grid, placing 2 non-overlapping 2x2 icons would leave 7 cells free.

For example, placing one 2x2 icon at row 1, column 1 and another at row 3, column 1:

- First 2x2: cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

- Second 2x2: cells (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)

- Remaining cells: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) â€” total 7 cells.

So, per screen, with 2 2x2 icons, 7 cells are left for 1x1 icons.

Similarly, with 1 2x2 icon, 11 cells are left for 1x1 icons.

With 0 2x2 icons, all 15 cells are available for 1x1 icons.

Given that, we can model the problem as follows:

- Each screen can be used in one of three ways:

a. Place 2 2x2 icons and up to 7 1x1 icons.

b. Place 1 2x2 icon and up to 11 1x1 icons.

c. Place only 1x1 icons, up to 15 of them.

Our goal is to minimize the number of screens used while satisfying the requirements of placing all x 1x1 icons and y 2x2 icons.

This seems like an integer linear programming problem, but since the constraints are small (x and y up to 99), we can try to find a greedy approach.

A possible greedy approach:

1. Calculate the number of screens needed solely for the 2x2 icons, assuming each screen holds up to 2 2x2 icons. So, screens_for_y = ceil(y / 2).

2. Calculate the total number of 1x1 icons that can be placed along with these y 2x2 icons.

- If we use screens_for_y screens, each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

- So, total 1x1 icons that can be placed along with y 2x2 icons is screens_for_y * 7.

- If x <= screens_for_y * 7, then the total screens needed are screens_for_y.

- Else, we need additional screens to place the remaining 1x1 icons.

- The remaining 1x1 icons are x - (screens_for_y * 7).

- Additional screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons are ceil((x - screens_for_y * 7) / 15).

- Hence, total screens = screens_for_y + ceil((x - screens_for_y * 7) / 15).

Wait, but this might not be optimal because sometimes placing one less 2x2 icon and more 1x1 icons could lead to fewer screens.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose y = 3 and x = 10.

According to the above approach:

- screens_for_y = ceil(3 / 2) = 2 screens.

- Total 1x1 icons that can be placed along with y 2x2 icons: 2 screens * 7 = 14.

- Since x = 10 <= 14, total screens = 2.

But, is there a way to use fewer screens?

Wait, no. 2 screens are needed to place 3 2x2 icons (since each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons), and there's enough space left for 14 1x1 icons, which is more than enough for x=10.

Another example:

y = 4, x = 20.

- screens_for_y = ceil(4 / 2) = 2 screens.

- Total 1x1 icons that can be placed along with y 2x2 icons: 2 screens * 7 = 14.

- x = 20 > 14, so additional screens needed: ceil((20 - 14)/15) = ceil(6/15) = 1.

- Total screens = 2 + 1 = 3.

Is there a better way?

If we use 2 screens for 4 2x2 icons and 14 1x1 icons, but we have 20 1x1 icons, so we need one more screen for the remaining 6 1x1 icons, totaling 3 screens.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use 3 screens:

- Screen 1: 2 2x2 icons + 7 1x1 icons.

- Screen 2: 2 2x2 icons + 7 1x1 icons.

- Screen 3: 0 2x2 icons + 6 1x1 icons.

Total screens still 3.

Alternatively, maybe use screens differently.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way by adjusting the number of 2x2 icons per screen.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons, or 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons, or 0 2x2 icons and 15 1x1 icons.

Our goal is to minimize the number of screens while satisfying y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled using integer variables for the number of screens used in each mode (0,1, or 2 2x2 icons).

Let me define:

- Let s2 be the number of screens with 2 2x2 icons and up to 7 1x1 icons.

- Let s1 be the number of screens with 1 2x2 icon and up to 11 1x1 icons.

- Let s0 be the number of screens with 0 2x2 icons and up to 15 1x1 icons.

We need to satisfy:

- 2*s2 + 1*s1 >= y (for the 2x2 icons)

- 7*s2 + 11*s1 + 15*s0 >= x (for the 1x1 icons)

And minimize s2 + s1 + s0.

This is an integer linear programming problem, but given the small constraints, we can try to find a greedy solution.

A possible greedy approach is:

1. Use as many screens as possible with 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

2. Then use screens with 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons.

3. Finally, use screens with only 1x1 icons.

But we need to optimize the usage.

Let me think differently.

Let me iterate over the possible number of screens with 2 2x2 icons (s2), from 0 up to floor(y / 2).

For each s2, calculate the remaining y_after = y - 2*s2.

Then, use screens with 1 2x2 icon (s1), where s1 >= y_after.

The total screens used for y would be s2 + s1.

Then, calculate the total 1x1 capacity: 7*s2 + 11*s1 + 15*s0 >= x.

But this seems too time-consuming for implementation, especially since t can be up to 10^4.

I need a faster way.

Looking back at the initial approach:

- Calculate screens_for_y = ceil(y / 2).

- Calculate the total 1x1 capacity with these screens: screens_for_y * 7.

- If x <= screens_for_y * 7, then total screens = screens_for_y.

- Else, additional screens needed for remaining x: ceil((x - screens_for_y * 7) / 15).

- Total screens = screens_for_y + additional_screens.

This seems efficient and correct.

But let's verify with some test cases.

Looking at the sample input and output:

Input:

11

1 1

7 2

12 4

0 3

1 0

8 1

0 0

2 0

15 0

8 2

0 9

Output:

1

1

2

2

1

1

0

1

1

2

5

Let's verify the first test case:

x=1, y=1.

screens_for_y = ceil(1 / 2) = 1.

Total 1x1 capacity: 1 * 7 = 7.

Since x=1 <=7, total screens=1.

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

x=7, y=2.

screens_for_y=ceil(2/2)=1.

Total 1x1 capacity:1*7=7.

x=7<=7, total screens=1.

Matches sample output.

Third test case:

x=12, y=4.

screens_for_y=ceil(4/2)=2.

Total 1x1 capacity:2*7=14.

x=12<=14, total screens=2.

Matches sample output.

Fourth test case:

x=0, y=3.

screens_for_y=ceil(3/2)=2.

Total 1x1 capacity:2*7=14.

x=0<=14, total screens=2.

Matches sample output.

Fifth test case:

x=1, y=0.

screens_for_y=ceil(0/2)=0.

Total 1x1 capacity:0*7=0.

x=1>0, so additional screens=ceil(1/15)=1.

Total screens=0+1=1.

Matches sample output.

Sixth test case:

x=8, y=1.

screens_for_y=ceil(1/2)=1.

Total 1x1 capacity:1*7=7.

x=8>7, additional screens=ceil(1/15)=1.

Total screens=1+1=2.

Wait, but sample output is 1.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, sample input is:

8 1

Sample output is:

1

But according to my calculation, it should be 2 screens.

But sample output is 1, which means there's an error in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, in the sample input, for x=8, y=1:

According to my earlier logic:

screens_for_y = ceil(1 / 2) = 1.

Total 1x1 capacity:1*7=7.

x=8>7, so additional screens=ceil(1/15)=1.

Total screens=1+1=2.

But sample output is 1, which suggests that my approach is incorrect.

Hence, my initial approach is flawed.

I need to find a better way to calculate the minimum number of screens.

Let me consider that sometimes placing fewer 2x2 icons on a screen can allow for more 1x1 icons.

For example, if I place only one 2x2 icon on a screen, I can place up to 11 1x1 icons on that screen.

So, in the previous test case, x=8, y=1:

- Use one screen with 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons.

- This can accommodate y=1 and x=11, which is more than x=8.

- Hence, only one screen is needed.

This shows that my initial approach is not optimal.

So, I need to adjust my strategy.

A better approach might be:

- Calculate the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can be placed on the screens, considering the 1x1 icons.

- Try to maximize the use of screens that can hold one 2x2 icon and as many 1x1 icons as possible.

Let me think differently.

Let me calculate the total number of cells needed.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, and each 1x1 icon takes 1 cell.

So, total cells needed: 4*y + x.

Each screen has 15 cells.

So, a naive approach would be to divide the total cells needed by the cells per screen and take the ceiling.

But this doesn't consider the constraints of icon placements.

For example, in the earlier test case, x=8, y=1:

Total cells needed: 4*1 + 8 = 12.

Number of screens needed: ceil(12 / 15) = 1.

This matches the sample output.

But this approach doesn't consider that 2x2 icons cannot be placed overlapping and have specific positions.

However, in this particular case, it seems to work.

Let me check another test case.

Test case: x=15, y=0.

Total cells needed: 0*4 + 15*1 = 15.

ceil(15 / 15) = 1.

Sample output is 1, which matches.

Another test case: x=0, y=3.

Total cells needed: 3*4 + 0 = 12.

ceil(12 / 15) = 1.

But sample output is 2, which doesn't match.

Hence, this naive approach is incorrect.

So, the total cells needed divided by 15 doesn't always give the correct number of screens due to the placement constraints of 2x2 icons.

Back to the drawing board.

Let me consider that each screen can be configured in different ways:

- Option A: 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

- Option B: 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons.

- Option C: 0 2x2 icons and 15 1x1 icons.

Our goal is to minimize the number of screens used to accommodate y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons.

This can be formulated as an integer programming problem, but for efficiency, we need a faster approach.

Let me try to find a greedy approach.

I can start by maximizing the use of screens with 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

Calculate how many screens are needed to place as many 2x2 icons as possible in screens with 2 2x2 icons.

Let s2 be the number of screens with 2 2x2 icons.

Then, s2 = floor(y / 2).

Remaining y_after = y - 2*s2.

Then, for the remaining y_after 2x2 icons, I need s1 screens with 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons.

s1 = y_after.

Then, the total screens for y are s2 + s1.

The total capacity for 1x1 icons is:

capacity_x = s2*7 + s1*11 + s0*15 >= x.

But s0 is the additional screens needed for the remaining x after accounting for the capacity in s2 and s1 screens.

But this seems complicated.

Let me try to find a better way.

An alternative approach is to iterate over the number of screens with 2 2x2 icons (s2 from 0 to floor(y / 2)), and for each s2, calculate the remaining y_after and x_after, and find the minimum total screens.

But since t can be up to 10^4, this approach might be too slow if not implemented efficiently.

I need a mathematical formula that can directly calculate the minimum number of screens.

Let me consider that each screen with 2 2x2 icons can absorb 2 y and 7 x.

Each screen with 1 2x2 icon can absorb 1 y and 11 x.

Each screen with 0 y can absorb 15 x.

I need to maximize the absorption of y and x with the least number of screens.

This seems like a classic optimization problem.

Wait, perhaps I can use the following approach:

- Calculate the maximum number of screens that can be used with 2 2x2 icons, given y.

- For each such screen, reduce y by 2 and x by 7.

- Then, calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining y and x.

But I need to ensure that this minimizes the total number of screens.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let s2 = floor(y / 2).

Then, y_after = y - 2*s2.

x_after = x - s2*7.

Now, for the remaining y_after and x_after, I need to allocate screens with either 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons, or just 15 1x1 icons.

So, s1 = y_after.

x_after = x_after - s1*11.

If x_after > 0, then s0 = ceil(x_after / 15).

Total screens = s2 + s1 + s0.

But I need to ensure that this is minimized.

Wait, but in some cases, it might be better to use fewer s2 screens and more s1 screens to accommodate more x.

Let me consider an example.

Test case: x=8, y=1.

Option 1:

s2 = floor(1 / 2) = 0.

y_after =1 - 0 =1.

x_after=8 - 0*7=8.

s1=1.

x_after=8 - 1*11=8-11=-3 <=0.

So, s0=0.

Total screens=0+1+0=1.

Which matches the sample output.

Option 2:

s2=0.

s1=1.

x_after=8 -11=-3.

s0=0.

Total screens=1.

Option 3:

s2=0.

s1=0.

x_after=8.

s0=ceil(8/15)=1.

Total screens=1.

But in this case, s1=1 can handle x=8 since 11 >8.

So, 1 screen is sufficient.

Another test case: x=12, y=4.

Option 1:

s2=floor(4/2)=2.

y_after=4-4=0.

x_after=12-2*7=12-14=-2 <=0.

Total screens=2+0+0=2.

Which matches the sample output.

Option 2:

s2=1.

y_after=4-2=2.

x_after=12-7=5.

s1=2.

x_after=5-2*11=5-22=-17 <=0.

Total screens=1+2+0=3.

Which is worse than Option 1.

Hence, Option 1 is better.

Another test case: x=0, y=3.

Option 1:

s2=floor(3/2)=1.

y_after=3-2=1.

x_after=0-7=-7 <=0.

s1=1.

s0=0.

Total screens=1+1+0=2.

Option 2:

s2=0.

y_after=3.

x_after=0.

s1=3.

x_after=0-3*11=-33 <=0.

s0=0.

Total screens=0+3+0=3.

Hence, Option 1 is better with 2 screens.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=15, y=0.

s2=0.

y_after=0.

x_after=15.

s0=ceil(15/15)=1.

Total screens=0+0+1=1.

Matches sample output.

Another test case: x=0, y=0.

s2=0.

y_after=0.

x_after=0.

s0=0.

Total screens=0.

Matches sample output.

Another test case: x=2, y=0.

s2=0.

y_after=0.

x_after=2.

s0=ceil(2/15)=1.

Total screens=0+0+1=1.

Which should be correct.

Another test case: x=0, y=99.

s2=floor(99/2)=49.

y_after=99-98=1.

x_after=0-49*7=-343 <=0.

s1=1.

s0=0.

Total screens=49+1+0=50.

Is this optimal?

Alternatively, if we use 50 screens with 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons, that would be 100 2x2 icons and 350 1x1 icons, which is more than enough for y=99 and x=0.

But we only need y=99, so perhaps we can use 49 screens with 2 2x2 icons (98 icons) and 1 screen with 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons.

Total screens=50.

Wait, but we only need 99 2x2 icons, so perhaps we can use 49 screens with 2 icons and 1 screen with 1 icon.

Total screens=50.

Same as before.

Hence, it seems optimal.

So, the initial approach seems to work.

Hence, the formula is:

s2 = floor(y / 2)

y_after = y - 2*s2

x_after = x - 7*s2

if x_after > 0:

s1 = y_after

x_after -= 11*s1

if x_after > 0:

s0 = ceil(x_after / 15)

else:

s0 = 0

total_screens = s2 + s1 + s0

But in the earlier test case, when x=8, y=1:

s2 = floor(1 / 2) = 0

y_after =1 -0=1

x_after=8-0*7=8

s1=1

x_after=8-11=-3 <=0

s0=0

total_screens=0+1+0=1

Which matches the sample.

Another test case: x=15, y=0

s2=0

y_after=0

x_after=15-0=15

s1=0

x_after=15-0=15

s0=ceil(15/15)=1

total_screens=0+0+1=1

Correct.

Another test case: x=0, y=3

s2=floor(3/2)=1

y_after=3-2=1

x_after=0-7=-7 <=0

s1=1

x_after=-7-11=-18 <=0

s0=0

total_screens=1+1+0=2

Which matches the sample.

Seems correct.

Another test case: x=99, y=99

s2=floor(99/2)=49

y_after=99-98=1

x_after=99-49*7=99-343=-244 <=0

s1=1

x_after=-244-11=-255 <=0

s0=0

total_screens=49+1+0=50

Is this optimal?

Alternative approach:

If we use 49 screens with 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons: 98 2x2 icons and 343 1x1 icons.

Then, we have y_after=1, x_after=99-343=-244.

Then, s1=1 for the remaining y_after=1.

x_after=-244-11=-255 <=0.

Hence, s0=0.

Total screens=49+1+0=50.

Seems optimal.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

Now, looking back at the provided program, let's see if it implements this logic.

Looking at `func_2()`:

if x > 0 and y > 0:

bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1

print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

elif x == 0 and y > 0:

print(math.ceil(y / 2))

elif x > 0 and y == 0:

print(math.ceil(x / 15))

else:

print(0)

This seems different from the logic I derived.

In particular, the calculation of x after accounting for y is:

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

This seems off.

It's subtracting bxsfory * 15 and adding y * 4.

I'm not sure why it's adding y * 4.

In my logic, it should be subtracting the cells used by y 2x2 icons from the total cells needed for x.

Wait, perhaps the author is trying to calculate the remaining x after accounting for the screens used for y.

But it's not clear.

Let me try to see with the test case x=8, y=1.

bxsfory = ceil(1 / 2)=1

x = 8 -1*15 +1*4=8-15+4=-3

bxsfory1=0 since x <=0

print(0 +1)=1

Which matches the sample.

Another test case: x=12, y=4.

bxsfory=ceil(4/2)=2

x=12 -2*15 +4*4=12-30+16=-30+16=-14

bxsfory1=0

print(0+2)=2

Which matches the sample.

Another test case: x=0, y=3.

bxsfory=ceil(3/2)=2

x=0 -2*15 +3*4=0-30+12=-18

bxsfory1=0

print(0+2)=2

Correct.

Another test case: x=15, y=0.

x >0 and y==0:

print(ceil(15/15))=1

Correct.

Another test case: x=0, y=0:

print(0)

Correct.

Another test case: x=2, y=0:

print(ceil(2/15))=1

Correct.

Another test case: x=0, y=99:

print(ceil(99/2))=50

Which should be correct, as per earlier calculation.

Hence, despite the unclear formula, it seems to produce correct results for the test cases I've checked.

Perhaps there's a mathematical justification for the formula used in the program.

Let me try to understand the formula:

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Wait, it's subtracting bxsfory * 15 and adding y * 4.

This seems counterintuitive, as adding y*4 would increase x, which doesn't make sense in the context.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it should be x = x - bxsfory * 15 - y * 4.

But in the program, it's written as x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4.

Which is strange.

Let me check with x=8, y=1:

x = 8 - 1*15 +1*4=8-15+4=-3

Then bxsfory1=0 since x<=0

Total screens=bxsfory1 + bxsfory=0 +1=1

Correct.

Another test case: x=12, y=4.

x=12 -2*15 +4*4=12-30+16=-30+16=-14

bxsfory1=0

Total screens=0+2=2

Correct.

Another test case: x=0, y=3.

x=0 -2*15 +3*4=0-30+12=-18

bxsfory1=0

Total screens=0+2=2

Correct.

Another test case: x=15, y=0.

Directly prints ceil(15/15)=1

Correct.

Another test case: x=2, y=0.

prints ceil(2/15)=1

Correct.

Another test case: x=0, y=99.

prints ceil(99/2)=50

Correct.

Hence, despite the seemingly incorrect formula, it produces correct results for the test cases I've checked.

Perhaps there's a mathematical reasoning behind it.

Let me try to find a general formula.

Let s be the total number of screens.

Each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

So, for s screens:

- Up to 2s 2x2 icons.

- Up to 7s 1x1 icons.

But, if we use some screens with only 1 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons.

So, it's a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps the formula in the program is derived from considering the total cells.

Each screen has 15 cells.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.

Each 1x1 icon takes 1 cell.

So, total cells needed: 4*y + x.

Total cells available per screen:15.

Hence, the minimal number of screens needed is ceil((4*y + x)/15).

But, in the program, it's not directly using this formula.

Wait, let's see.

In the program, for x>0 and y>0:

bxsfory = ceil(y / 2)

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

bxsfory1 = 0 if x <=0 else ceil(x /15)+1

print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

Wait, ceil(x /15)+1 seems off.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake, and it should be ceil(x /15).

But in the program, it's ceil(x /15)+1.

But in the test case x=8, y=1:

bxsfory=1

x=8-15+4=-3

bxsfory1=0

total screens=0+1=1

Correct.

Another test case x=7, y=2:

bxsfory=1

x=7-15+8=7-15+8=0

bxsfory1=0

total screens=0+1=1

Correct.

Another test case x=12, y=4:

bxsfory=2

x=12-30+16=-2

bxsfory1=0

total screens=0+2=2

Correct.

Another test case x=0, y=3:

bxsfory=2

x=0-30+12=-18

bxsfory1=0

total screens=0+2=2

Correct.

Another test case x=15, y=0:

Directly prints ceil(15/15)=1

Correct.

Another test case x=0, y=0:

prints 0

Correct.

Another test case x=2, y=0:

prints ceil(2/15)=1

Correct.

Another test case x=0
