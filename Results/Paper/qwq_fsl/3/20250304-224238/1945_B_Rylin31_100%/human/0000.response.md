Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time, given the frequencies of two installations and the visibility time of each firework.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. There are two installations launching fireworks at regular intervals: the first every 'a' minutes and the second every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible for 'm + 1' minutes after launch. The goal is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky.

The program provided is:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

I need to determine if this program correctly computes the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks for any given inputs a, b, and m within the specified constraints.

Let me start by analyzing the approach used in the code. The program reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads a, b, and m. Then, it computes and prints the value of floor division of m by a plus floor division of m by b plus 2.

So, the formula used is:

max_simultaneous = m // a + m // b + 2

I need to verify if this formula always gives the correct maximum number of simultaneous fireworks for any valid inputs of a, b, and m.

To do this, I should consider different scenarios and see if the formula holds.

**Case 1: a and b are co-prime**

Let's take a = 2, b = 3, m = 4

Calculating max_simultaneous:

4 // 2 = 2

4 // 3 = 1

Total = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5

Now, let's simulate the fireworks:

- Installation 1 launches at 2, 4, 6, 8, ...

- Installation 2 launches at 3, 6, 9, 12, ...

Visibility:

- Firework launched at 2 is visible from 2 to 6

- Firework launched at 3 is visible from 3 to 7

- Firework launched at 4 is visible from 4 to 8

- Firework launched at 6 is visible from 6 to 10

- Firework launched at 8 is visible from 8 to 12

At time 6:

- Fireworks from installation 1 launched at 2, 4, and 6 are visible (times 2-6, 4-8, 6-10)

- Firework from installation 2 launched at 3 and 6 are visible (times 3-7, 6-10)

So, at time 6, there are 5 fireworks visible, which matches the formula.

**Case 2: a and b are not co-prime**

Let a = 4, b = 6, m = 10

Calculating max_simultaneous:

10 // 4 = 2

10 // 6 = 1

Total = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5

Simulate fireworks:

- Installation 1 launches at 4, 8, 12, 16, ...

- Installation 2 launches at 6, 12, 18, ...

Visibility:

- Firework launched at 4: 4-14

- Firework launched at 6: 6-16

- Firework launched at 8: 8-18

- Firework launched at 12: 12-22

At time 8:

- Fireworks from installation 1: 4-14, 8-18

- Firework from installation 2: 6-16

Total visible: 3 from installation 1 (4,6,8) and 1 from installation 2 (6), but overlapping at time 8: 4-14, 6-16, 8-18 from installation 1 and 6-16 from installation 2. So, 4 fireworks visible.

At time 12:

- Fireworks from installation 1: 4-14, 8-18, 12-22

- Firework from installation 2: 6-16, 12-22

Total visible: 5 fireworks.

So, the formula seems to hold.

**Case 3: a = b**

Let a = 1, b = 1, m = 1

Calculating max_simultaneous:

1 // 1 = 1

1 // 1 = 1

Total = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

Simulate fireworks:

- Both installations launch every 1 minute.

- Each firework is visible for 2 minutes.

At time 1:

- Fireworks from both installations launched at 1 are visible from 1-2

At time 2:

- Fireworks from both installations launched at 1 and 2 are visible from 1-2 and 2-3

So, at time 2: 4 fireworks visible, which matches the formula.

**Case 4: a and b are large numbers**

Let a = 1000000000000000000, b = 1000000000000000000, m = 1000000000000000000

Calculating max_simultaneous:

1000000000000000000 // 1000000000000000000 = 1

1 + 1 + 2 = 4

Simulate fireworks:

- Both installations launch every 1000000000000000000 minutes.

- Each firework is visible for 1000000000000000001 minutes.

At the launch time, both installations launch fireworks that are visible for the next 1000000000000000001 minutes.

So, at the launch time, there are 4 fireworks visible: two from each installation's first launch.

This seems correct.

**Case 5: a and b are different, m is large**

Let a = 5, b = 6, m = 78123459896

Calculating max_simultaneous:

78123459896 // 5 = 15624691979

78123459896 // 6 = 13020576649

Total = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630

This matches the sample output provided.

**Case 6: a = b = 1, m = 1**

Calculating max_simultaneous:

1 // 1 = 1

1 // 1 = 1

Total = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

Simulate fireworks:

- Both installations launch every 1 minute.

- Each firework is visible for 2 minutes.

At time 1:

- Fireworks from both installations launched at 1 are visible from 1-2

At time 2:

- Fireworks from both installations launched at 1 and 2 are visible from 1-2 and 2-3

So, at time 2: 4 fireworks visible, which matches the formula.

**Case 7: a = 1, b = 2, m = 1**

Calculating max_simultaneous:

1 // 1 = 1

1 // 2 = 0

Total = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3

Simulate fireworks:

- Installation 1 launches every 1 minute: at 1,2,3,...

- Installation 2 launches every 2 minutes: at 2,4,6,...

Visibility:

- Firework launched at 1: visible from 1-2

- Firework launched at 2: visible from 2-3 (from both installations)

At time 2:

- From installation 1: fireworks launched at 1 and 2 are visible (1-2 and 2-3)

- From installation 2: firework launched at 2 is visible (2-3)

So, total visible at time 2: 3 fireworks, which matches the formula.

**Case 8: a = 7, b = 8, m = 56**

Calculating max_simultaneous:

56 // 7 = 8

56 // 8 = 7

Total = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17

This matches the sample output.

**Case 9: a = 5, b = 6, m = 78123459896**

Calculating max_simultaneous:

78123459896 // 5 = 15624691979

78123459896 // 6 = 13020576649

Total = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630

Again, matches the sample output.

**Case 10: a = 1, b = 1, m = 1000000000000000000**

Calculating max_simultaneous:

1000000000000000000 // 1 = 1000000000000000000

1000000000000000000 // 1 = 1000000000000000000

Total = 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002

This matches the sample output.

From all these test cases, it seems like the formula is working correctly. But I need to ensure that there are no edge cases where this formula might fail.

Let me consider some edge cases:

**Edge Case 1: a = 1, b = 1, m = 0**

Calculating max_simultaneous:

0 // 1 = 0

0 // 1 = 0

Total = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2

Simulate fireworks:

- Both installations launch every 1 minute.

- Each firework is visible for 1 minute (m + 1 = 1).

At launch time (t=0):

- Fireworks launched at t=0 are visible from 0 to 0.

At t=1:

- Fireworks launched at t=1 are visible from 1 to 1.

So, at any given time, only the firework launched at that minute is visible from both installations, totaling 2 fireworks.

This matches the formula.

**Edge Case 2: a = 1, b = 2, m = 0**

Calculating max_simultaneous:

0 // 1 = 0

0 // 2 = 0

Total = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2

Simulate fireworks:

- Installation 1 launches every 1 minute.

- Installation 2 launches every 2 minutes.

- Each firework is visible for 1 minute.

At t=0:

- Fireworks from installation 1 at t=0 visible at t=0.

- Fireworks from installation 2 at t=0 visible at t=0.

Total visible: 2 fireworks.

At t=1:

- Fireworks from installation 1 at t=1 visible at t=1.

- Fireworks from installation 2 at t=0 are no longer visible.

Total visible: 1 firework.

At t=2:

- Fireworks from installation 1 at t=2 visible at t=2.

- Fireworks from installation 2 at t=2 visible at t=2.

Total visible: 2 fireworks.

So, the maximum is 2, which matches the formula.

**Edge Case 3: a = 1, b = 1, m = 1**

Calculating max_simultaneous:

1 // 1 = 1

1 // 1 = 1

Total = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

Simulate fireworks:

- Both installations launch every 1 minute.

- Each firework is visible for 2 minutes.

At t=0:

- Fireworks launched at t=0 from both installations visible at t=0 to t=1.

At t=1:

- Fireworks launched at t=0 and t=1 from both installations visible at t=1.

Total visible: 4 fireworks.

This matches the formula.

**Edge Case 4: a = 1, b = 2, m = 1**

Calculating max_simultaneous:

1 // 1 = 1

1 // 2 = 0

Total = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3

Simulate fireworks:

- Installation 1 launches at t=0,1,2,3,...

- Installation 2 launches at t=0,2,4,...

- Each firework is visible for 2 minutes.

At t=0:

- Fireworks from installation 1 at t=0 visible at t=0 to t=1.

- Fireworks from installation 2 at t=0 visible at t=0 to t=1.

Total visible: 2 fireworks.

At t=1:

- Fireworks from installation 1 at t=0 and t=1 visible at t=1.

- Fireworks from installation 2 at t=0 visible at t=1.

Total visible: 3 fireworks.

At t=2:

- Fireworks from installation 1 at t=1 and t=2 visible at t=2.

- Fireworks from installation 2 at t=2 visible at t=2.

Total visible: 3 fireworks.

So, the maximum is 3, which matches the formula.

**Edge Case 5: a = 2, b = 3, m = 1**

Calculating max_simultaneous:

1 // 2 = 0

1 // 3 = 0

Total = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2

Simulate fireworks:

- Installation 1 launches at t=2,4,6,...

- Installation 2 launches at t=3,6,9,...

- Each firework is visible for 2 minutes.

At t=2:

- Firework from installation 1 at t=2 visible at t=2 to t=3.

At t=3:

- Firework from installation 1 at t=2 visible at t=3.

- Firework from installation 2 at t=3 visible at t=3 to t=4.

Total visible: 2 fireworks.

At t=4:

- Firework from installation 1 at t=2 is no longer visible.

- Firework from installation 1 at t=4 visible at t=4 to t=5.

- Firework from installation 2 at t=3 is still visible at t=4.

Total visible: 2 fireworks.

At t=6:

- Firework from installation 1 at t=4 is no longer visible.

- Firework from installation 1 at t=6 visible at t=6 to t=7.

- Firework from installation 2 at t=6 visible at t=6 to t=7.

Total visible: 2 fireworks.

So, the maximum is 2, which matches the formula.

**Edge Case 6: a = 1, b = 1000000000000000000, m = 1**

Calculating max_simultaneous:

1 // 1 = 1

1 // 1000000000000000000 = 0

Total = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3

Simulate fireworks:

- Installation 1 launches every 1 minute.

- Installation 2 launches every 1000000000000000000 minutes.

- Each firework is visible for 2 minutes.

At t=0:

- Firework from installation 1 at t=0 visible at t=0 to t=1.

- Firework from installation 2 at t=0 visible at t=0 to t=1.

Total visible: 2 fireworks.

At t=1:

- Firework from installation 1 at t=0 is no longer visible.

- Firework from installation 1 at t=1 visible at t=1 to t=2.

- Firework from installation 2 at t=0 still visible at t=1.

Total visible: 2 fireworks.

At t=1000000000000000000:

- Firework from installation 1 at t=1000000000000000000 visible at t=1000000000000000000 to t=1000000000000000001.

- Firework from installation 2 at t=1000000000000000000 visible at t=1000000000000000000 to t=1000000000000000001.

Total visible: 2 fireworks.

But according to the formula, it should be 3. Wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, installation 1 launches every 1 minute, so at t=1000000000000000000, there is a firework launched at t=1000000000000000000 visible from t=1000000000000000000 to t=1000000000000000001.

Installation 2 launches at t=1000000000000000000, so there is another firework visible from t=1000000000000000000 to t=1000000000000000001.

Additionally, the firework from installation 1 launched at t=999999999999999999 is visible from t=999999999999999999 to t=1000000000000000000.

But t=1000000000000000000 is included in t=999999999999999999 to t=1000000000000000000.

So, at t=1000000000000000000:

- Firework from installation 1 at t=999999999999999999 visible at t=1000000000000000000.

- Firework from installation 1 at t=1000000000000000000 visible at t=1000000000000000000 to t=1000000000000000001.

Total visible: 3 fireworks.

Ah, so the formula is correct in this case as well.

**Edge Case 7: a = 1, b = m + 1**

Let a = 3, b = 4, m = 2

Calculating max_simultaneous:

2 // 4 = 0

Total = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2

Simulate fireworks:

- Installation 1 launches at t=3,6,9,...

Let a = 3, b = 3, m = 2

Calculating max_simultaneous:

2 // 3 = 0

2 // 3 = 0

Total = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2

Simulate fireworks:

- Installation 1 launches at t=3,6,
