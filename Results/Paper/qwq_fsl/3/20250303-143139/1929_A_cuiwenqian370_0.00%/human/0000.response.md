Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description. The program is supposed to maximize the "beauty" of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. We have multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers. For each array, I need to rearrange its elements to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

Looking at the provided program, it seems the approach is to sort the array and then arrange elements in a specific pattern to maximize the beauty. Specifically, it sorts the array and then alternately picks the highest and lowest remaining elements to create a new arrangement.

Let me break down the program step by step:

1. Read the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read the integer n, the length of the array.

b. Read the array arr of n integers.

c. Call func_1 with n and arr, and store the result.

3. After processing all test cases, print each result.

Now, let's look into func_1:

- It sorts the array in ascending order.

- It initializes a new array by alternately taking the smallest and largest remaining elements from the sorted array.

- It calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in this new arrangement.

Wait a minute, the problem says to calculate (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n, but the program uses abs(a_i - a_{i-1}). Are these the same?

Let's see. The problem says to compute the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), which could be positive or negative depending on whether a_i is greater or smaller than a_{i-1}. However, the program uses the absolute difference, which always makes the difference positive.

Is this a mistake? Let's check the example provided in the problem description.

In the first test case:

Input:

3

2 1 3

Expected Output:

2

According to the explanation, the arrangement is [1, 2, 3], and the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

If we use absolute differences, it's the same: |2-1| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2.

But what if the arrangement is [1, 3, 2]? Then the beauty would be (3-1) + (2-3) = 2 - 1 = 1, which is less than 2.

So, the program's approach seems to be maximizing the sum of absolute differences, but the problem asks for the sum of differences without absolute values.

Wait, but in the example, both approaches give the same result. Maybe they are equivalent in some cases.

Let me think about another example.

Consider an array [1, 2, 3, 4].

Arrangement to maximize sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}): [1, 2, 3, 4], sum = (2-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Arrangement to maximize sum of abs(a_i - a_{i-1}): [1, 4, 2, 3], sum = |4-1| + |2-4| + |3-2| = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.

But the problem asks for the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), not the sum of abs(a_i - a_{i-1}).

Wait, in the problem statement, it's (a_i - a_{i-1}), which can be negative if a_i < a_{i-1}.

So, the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n is equal to a_n - a_1, because it's a telescoping sum.

Wait, really? Let's see:

Sum = (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) = an - a1.

So, regardless of the arrangement, the sum is always an - a1.

If that's the case, then to maximize the sum, we just need to maximize an - a1, which is achieved by arranging the array in any order where the largest element is last and the smallest is first.

So, the maximum beauty is max(a) - min(a).

But in the program, it's calculating the sum of absolute differences, which is different.

Wait, in the example, sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) is 2, which is indeed a3 - a1 = 3 - 1 = 2.

Similarly, in the second test case:

Input:

3

69 69 69

Expected Output:

0

Which is 69 - 69 = 0.

In the third test case:

Input:

5

100 54 80 43 90

Expected Output:

57

Which is 100 - 43 = 57.

Indeed, in all these cases, the beauty is max(a) - min(a).

So, the program is unnecessarily calculating the sum of absolute differences, whereas it should just compute max(a) - min(a).

Is the program correct despite this discrepancy?

Wait, in the examples, both approaches give the same result, but as I saw in my earlier example, for [1,2,3,4], the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) is 3, which is a4 - a1 = 4 - 1 = 3.

But if I arrange it as [1,3,2,4], sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) is (3-1) + (2-3) + (4-2) = 2 -1 + 2 = 3, which is still a4 - a1.

So, regardless of the arrangement, the sum is always max(a) - min(a).

Therefore, the program is overly complicated and incorrect because it calculates sum of absolute differences, which is not required.

But in the examples, both approaches give the same result, so maybe the problem intended for us to calculate sum of absolute differences.

Wait, no, the problem clearly states "the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n".

Which, as I saw, is equal to a_n - a_1.

But in the program, it's calculating sum of abs(a_i - a_{i-1}), which is different.

So, why does the program do this?

Probably a misunderstanding by the programmer.

But in the examples, both approaches give the same result, but in general, they are different.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the examples, they coincide, so maybe the problem wants the sum of absolute differences.

But the problem statement says "the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1})".

Which, mathematically, is equal to a_n - a_1.

But in the examples, it's consistent with sum of absolute differences.

Wait, in the first example:

Arrangement: [1,2,3]

Sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}): (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2

Sum of abs(a_i - a_{i-1}): |2-1| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2

Also, a_n - a_1 = 3 - 1 = 2

In the second example:

Arrangement: [69,69,69]

Sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}): (69-69) + (69-69) = 0 + 0 = 0

Sum of abs(a_i - a_{i-1}): |69-69| + |69-69| = 0 + 0 = 0

a_n - a_1 = 69 - 69 = 0

In the third example:

Arrangement: [43,100,54,80,90]

Sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}): (100-43) + (54-100) + (80-54) + (90-80) = 57 -46 +26 +10 = 57 -46 =11 +26=37+10=47

But the expected output is 57.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

According to the problem, the beauty should be a_n - a_1, which is 100 - 43 = 57.

But according to the program's approach of sum of abs(a_i - a_{i-1}), it would be |100-43| + |54-100| + |80-54| + |90-80| = 57 + 46 + 26 + 10 = 139, which is different from 57.

But the expected output is 57, which matches a_n - a_1.

So, either the problem has a mistake, or the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Let me read the problem description again.

"the beauty of the array a is the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n."

So, for array a = [a1, a2, a3, ..., an], beauty = (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) = an - a1.

So, it's always an - a1, regardless of the arrangement.

Then, why does the problem say "rearrange its elements in any way"?

Because perhaps the rearrangement affects the sum if we consider that a_i - a_{i-1} can be negative.

But mathematically, the sum is always an - a1, regardless of the arrangement.

Wait, is that always true?

Let me check with an example.

Take a = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Arrange as [1, 2, 3, 4]: sum = (2-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 = 4 - 1

Arrange as [1, 3, 2, 4]: sum = (3-1) + (2-3) + (4-2) = 2 -1 + 2 = 3 = 4 - 1

Arrange as [4, 3, 2, 1]: sum = (3-4) + (2-3) + (1-2) = -1 -1 -1 = -3 = 1 - 4

Wait, here the sum is negative, which is consistent with an - a1 = 1 - 4 = -3.

So, the sum is always an - a1, depending on the arrangement.

Therefore, to maximize the beauty, we need to maximize an - a1.

Which means arranging the array in ascending order, so an - a1 is max(a) - min(a).

But in the program, it's arranging the array in a different way: alternately taking the largest and smallest elements.

Wait, perhaps the program is trying to maximize the sum of absolute differences.

But according to the problem, we need to maximize the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), which is an - a1.

So, the program is incorrect.

Because the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) is always an - a1, regardless of the arrangement.

Hence, to maximize this, we need to maximize an - a1, which is achieved by placing the smallest element as a1 and the largest as an.

Therefore, sorting the array in ascending order and taking the sum as an - a1 would suffice.

But the program is doing something else: arranging the array in a specific pattern and summing the absolute differences.

This is unnecessary and incorrect.

Hence, the correctness is False.

Wait, but in the examples, the program seems to give the correct output.

In the first test case, arrangement [1,2,3], sum of abs differences is 2, which matches the expected output.

In the second test case, arrangement [69,69,69], sum of abs differences is 0, which matches.

In the third test case, arrangement [43,100,54,80,90], sum of abs differences is 57, which matches.

Wait, earlier I thought sum of abs differences would be 139, but according to the program's output, it's 57, which matches the expected output.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Looking back at the program:

def func_1(n, arr):

arr.sort()

new_arr = []

left = 0

right = n - 1

while left <= right:

if left == right:

new_arr.append(arr[left])

else:

new_arr.append(arr[right])

new_arr.append(arr[left])

left += 1

right -= 1

max_beauty = 0

for i in range(1, n):

max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])

return max_beauty

So, for the third test case:

arr = [100,54,80,43,90]

After sorting: [43,54,80,90,100]

Then, new_arr is constructed as follows:

- left=0, right=4: new_arr = [100,43]

- left=1, right=3: new_arr = [100,43,90,54]

- left=2, right=2: new_arr = [100,43,90,54,80]

So, new_arr = [100,43,90,54,80]

Then, sum of abs differences:

|43-100| + |90-43| + |54-90| + |80-54| = 57 + 47 + 36 + 26 = 166

But the expected output is 57.

Wait, but according to the problem, the beauty is an - a1 = 80 - 100 = -20

But the expected output is 57, which is 100 - 43.

Wait, perhaps the problem wants the absolute difference, but the statement says "the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1})".

Which is not the sum of absolute differences, but the sum of differences.

In the first arrangement [1,2,3], sum is 2, which is a3 - a1 = 3 -1 =2.

In the second arrangement [69,69,69], sum is 0, which is 69 -69 =0.

In the third arrangement [43,100,54,80,90], sum is 90 -43 =47, but the expected output is 57.

Wait, confusion here.

Looking back, perhaps I miscounted the arrangement.

Wait, maybe I need to arrange the array to maximize the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), which can be positive or negative.

But according to the problem, it's just the sum of differences, not absolute differences.

But in the examples, it seems like the sum is equal to max(a) - min(a).

Wait, in the first test case, sum is 2, which is 3-1=2.

In the second test case, sum is 0, which is 69-69=0.

In the third test case, sum is 57, which is 100-43=57.

So, it seems like the beauty is always max(a) - min(a), regardless of the arrangement.

Hence, the program should just output max(a) - min(a) for each test case.

But the program is doing something else: arranging the array in a specific way and summing absolute differences.

Yet, in the examples, this approach coincides with the expected output.

Wait, in the third test case, according to the program's arrangement, new_arr = [100,43,90,54,80]

Sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) would be (43-100) + (90-43) + (54-90) + (80-54) = -57 +47 -36 +26 = (-57 +47) + (-36 +26) = -10 + (-10) = -20

But the expected output is 57.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, but the program is summing abs(a_i - a_{i-1}), which would be |43-100| + |90-43| + |54-90| + |80-54| =57 +47 +36 +26 =166, which does not match the expected output of 57.

So, the program is incorrect.

But in the first test case, arrangement [1,2,3], sum of abs differences is 1 +1 =2, which matches the expected output.

In the second test case, arrangement [69,69,69], sum of abs differences is 0 +0 +0 =0, which matches.

In the third test case, arrangement [100,43,90,54,80], sum of abs differences is 57 +47 +36 +26 =166, but expected output is 57.

Wait, but the expected output is 57, which is different from 166.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the correctness is False.

Wait, but in the first test case, it coincides.

Maybe in some cases it works, but not all.

Hence, it's incorrect.

So, the answer should be Correctness: **False**

But perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the problem wants the sum of absolute differences, but states sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}).

But in the examples, sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) coincides with max(a) - min(a), which is 3-1=2, 69-69=0, 100-43=57.

Wait, in the third test case, sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) should be a5 - a1 =90 -43=47, but expected output is 57, which is 100 -43.

Confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the maximum possible sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), which can be achieved by arranging the array in a specific order.

Wait, perhaps arranging the array in a non-monotonic way to maximize the sum.

Wait, but mathematically, the sum is always an - a1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me consider that sum = an - a1.

Hence, to maximize sum, we need to maximize an - a1.

But an is the last element, and a1 is the first element.

To maximize an - a1, we need to maximize an and minimize a1.

Hence, set an to max(a) and a1 to min(a).

Hence, sum = max(a) - min(a).

So, the beauty is always max(a) - min(a), regardless of the arrangement.

Hence, the program should just output max(a) - min(a) for each test case.

But the program is doing something else.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - We need to maximize the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.
    - This sum can be simplified to a_n - a_1, where a_n is the last element and a_1 is the first element in the rearranged array.

2. **Optimal Arrangement**:
    - To maximize a_n - a_1, we should set a_n to the maximum value in the array and a_1 to the minimum value in the array.
    - Therefore, the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

3. **Implementation**:
    - For each test case, find the maximum and minimum elements in the array.
    - Compute their difference and output it.

### Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_val = max(arr)
    min_val = min(arr)
    result = max_val - min_val
    print(result)
```

### Explanation

- **Step-by-Step Execution**:
    1. Read the number of test cases, `t`.
    2. For each test case:
        - Read the length of the array, `n`.
        - Read the array elements.
        - Determine the maximum and minimum values in the array.
        - Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
        - Print the result for each test case.

- **Key Insight**:
    - The sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) from i=2 to n simplifies to a_n - a_1.
    - Hence, to maximize this sum, we need to maximize a_n - a_1, which is achieved by choosing the largest possible a_n and the smallest possible a_1.

- **Efficiency**:
    - Finding the maximum and minimum values in an array takes O(n) time.
    - This approach is efficient and straightforward, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.
