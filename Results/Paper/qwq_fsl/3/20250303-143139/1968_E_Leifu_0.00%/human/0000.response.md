Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between chosen cells in an n x n grid. The problem provides a description, some examples, and the program code to evaluate.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. Given an integer n, I have to choose n cells in an n x n grid and maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these cells. The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

The program is given, and I need to determine if it correctly achieves this goal for any n within the constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and t ≤ 50 test cases).

Looking at the program:

- It reads the number of test cases, t.

- For each test case:

- Reads n.

- Prints the coordinates of n cells.

The coordinates printed seem to follow a specific pattern:

- For n=2:

- Prints (1,1) and (1,2)

- For n=3:

- Prints (1,1), (1,2), and (2,3)

- For n=4:

- Prints (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), and (4,4)

- For n=5:

- Prints (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), and (5,5)

- For n=6:

- Prints (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), and (6,6)

Wait, but looking back at the example outputs provided in the problem description, they are different:

- For n=2:

- (1,1) and (1,2)

- For n=3:

- (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

- For n=4:

- (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

- For n=5:

- (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5)

- For n=6:

- (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)

So, already, the program's output differs from the example outputs. Does this mean the program is incorrect? Not necessarily, because there might be multiple correct ways to choose cells that maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. The problem says, "if there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any."

Therefore, as long as the program's output achieves the maximum possible number of distinct Manhattan distances, it's acceptable, even if it's different from the example outputs.

So, I need to verify if the program's approach correctly maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances for any n.

Looking at the program's logic:

- For n=2:

- Chooses (1,1) and (1,2)

- Manhattan distances: |1-1| + |1-2| = 1

- So, H = {1}, size 1

- But in the example, they have H = {0,1}, size 2

Wait, in the example for n=2, they choose (1,1) and (1,2), which gives distances 0 and 1, but according to the Manhattan distance formula, between two different cells, the distance should be at least 1. So, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, in the example, they include distances from a cell to itself, which is 0, but the problem says "any pair of cells," which might or might not include the same cell pair.

But in the problem statement, it says "between any pair of cells," and in the example, they include 0, which might be considering a cell to itself.

Wait, let's check the problem description again:

"Let H be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells."

Does "any pair of cells" include pairs where both cells are the same? If so, then the distance is 0, and it should be included.

In the first example for n=2:

- Pairs: (1,1) and (1,2), and (1,2) and (1,1), and (1,1) and (1,1), (1,2) and (1,2)

- Distances: 0, 1, 1, 0 → H = {0,1}, size 2

In the program's output for n=2:

- (1,1) and (1,2)

- Pairs: (1,1)-(1,2), (1,2)-(1,1), (1,1)-(1,1), (1,2)-(1,2)

- Distances: 1,1,0,0 → H = {0,1}, size 2

So, it matches the example in terms of H size.

For n=3:

- Example chooses (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

- Pairs:

- (2,1)-(2,3): |2-2| + |1-3| = 2

- (2,1)-(3,1): |2-3| + |1-1| = 1

- (2,3)-(3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3

- Plus distances to themselves: 0

- So H = {0,1,2,3}, size 4

- Program chooses (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

- Pairs:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,3): |1-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2)-(2,3): |1-2| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus distances to themselves: 0

- So H = {0,1,2,3}, size 4

- Same as the example

For n=4:

- Example chooses (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

- Pairs:

- (1,1)-(1,3): 2

- (1,1)-(4,3): 3 + 2 = 5

- (1,1)-(4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,3)-(4,3): 3

- (1,3)-(4,4): 3 + 1 = 4

- (4,3)-(4,4): 1

- Plus distances to themselves: 0

- H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 7

- Program chooses (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

- Pairs:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,4): 1 + 3 = 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,2)-(2,4): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 3 + 2 = 5

- (2,4)-(4,4): 2

- Plus distances to themselves: 0

- H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 7

- Same as the example

For n=5:

- Example chooses (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5)

- Pairs:

- (1,1)-(1,3): 2

- (1,1)-(1,4): 3

- (1,1)-(2,1): 1

- (1,1)-(5,5): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,3)-(1,4): 1

- (1,3)-(2,1): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,3)-(5,5): 4 + 2 = 6

- (1,4)-(2,1): 1 + 3 = 4

- (1,4)-(5,5): 4 + 1 = 5

- (2,1)-(5,5): 3 + 4 = 7

- Plus distances to themselves: 0

- H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9

- Program chooses (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

- Pairs:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,4): 1 + 3 = 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,1)-(5,5): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,2)-(2,4): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 3 + 2 = 5

- (1,2)-(5,5): 4 + 3 = 7

- (2,4)-(4,4): 2

- (2,4)-(5,5): 3 + 1 = 4

- (4,4)-(5,5): 1

- Plus distances to themselves: 0

- H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9

- Same as the example

For n=6:

- Example chooses (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)

- Pairs:

- (1,4)-(1,5): 1

- (1,4)-(1,6): 2

- (1,4)-(5,2): 4 + 2 = 6

- (1,4)-(5,5): 4 + 1 = 5

- (1,4)-(6,1): 5 + 3 = 8

- (1,5)-(1,6): 1

- (1,5)-(5,2): 4 + 3 = 7

- (1,5)-(5,5): 4

- (1,5)-(6,1): 5 + 4 = 9

- (1,6)-(5,2): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,6)-(5,5): 4 + 1 = 5

- (1,6)-(6,1): 5 + 5 = 10

- (5,2)-(5,5): 3

- (5,2)-(6,1): 1 + 1 = 2

- (5,5)-(6,1): 1 + 4 = 5

- Plus distances to themselves: 0

- H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, size 11

- Program chooses (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

- Pairs:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,4): 1 + 3 = 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,1)-(5,5): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,1)-(6,6): 5 + 5 = 10

- (1,2)-(2,4): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 3 + 2 = 5

- (1,2)-(5,5): 4 + 3 = 7

- (1,2)-(6,6): 5 + 4 = 9

- (2,4)-(4,4): 2

- (2,4)-(5,5): 3 + 1 = 4

- (2,4)-(6,6): 4 + 2 = 6

- (4,4)-(5,5): 1

- (4,4)-(6,6): 2 + 2 = 4

- (5,5)-(6,6): 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus distances to themselves: 0

- H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, size 11

- Same as the example

So, for n from 2 to 6, the program's output achieves the same size of H as the example. But is this generalizable for any n?

Looking at the program's logic:

- For n=2: (1,1), (1,2)

- For n=3: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

- For n=4: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

- For n=5: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

- For n=6: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

Pattern:

- Always choose (1,1)

- Then (1,2)

- Then (2,4)

- Then (4,4)

- Then (5,5)

- Then (6,6)

- And so on, for higher n, choosing (n,n)

Does this pattern maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances?

Let me try to generalize the pattern:

- Choose cells where for i from 1 to n:

- If i is 1: choose (1,1)

- If i is 2: choose (1,2)

- If i is 3: choose (2,4)

- If i is 4: choose (4,4)

- If i >=5: choose (i,i)

Wait, for n=3, the program chooses (1,1), (1,2), (2,4)

But in the example, for n=3, they choose (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

In the note, for n=3, they achieve H = {0,1,2,3}, size 4

With the program's choice: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4)

- Distances: 1, 3, 4 (plus 0 for each cell to itself)

- H = {0,1,3,4}, size 4

Which matches the example's H size.

But is 4 the maximum possible for n=3?

Let me see: in a 3x3 grid, choosing 3 cells.

Total possible unique Manhattan distances:

- Possible distances: 0,1,2,3,4

- But in a 3x3 grid, the maximum Manhattan distance is |3-1| + |3-1| = 4

- So, H can have up to 5 elements: {0,1,2,3,4}

But in the example and the program, H has size 4.

Is it possible to achieve H with size 5?

Let me try choosing different cells:

- Choose (1,1), (1,3), (3,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,3): 2

- (1,1)-(3,3): 2 + 2 = 4

- (1,3)-(3,3): 2

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,2,4}, size 3

- Not better than the previous choices

Another choice: (1,1), (2,2), (3,1)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,2): 1 + 1 = 2

- (1,1)-(3,1): 2

- (2,2)-(3,1): 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,2}, size 2

Worse.

Another choice: (1,1), (1,2), (3,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(3,3): 2 + 2 = 4

- (1,2)-(3,3): 2 + 1 = 3

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,1,3,4}, size 4

Same as before

Another choice: (1,1), (2,3), (3,2)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,3): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,1)-(3,2): 2 + 1 = 3

- (2,3)-(3,2): 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,2,3}, size 3

Not better

Seems like 4 is the maximum for n=3.

Hence, the program's choice is correct for n=3.

For n=4:

- Program chooses: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

- H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, size 7

Is 7 the maximum possible?

In a 4x4 grid, maximum Manhattan distance is 6 (e.g., |4-1| + |4-1| = 6)

Possible distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6

Hence, H can have up to 7 elements, which the program achieves.

Is it possible to have more than 7? No, because the grid only allows distances up to 6.

Hence, the program's choice is correct for n=4.

For n=5:

- Program chooses: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

- H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, size 9

In a 5x5 grid, maximum Manhattan distance is 8 (|5-1| + |5-1| = 8)

Possible distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

Hence, H can have up to 9 elements, which the program achieves.

For n=6:

- Program chooses: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

- H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, size 11

In a 6x6 grid, maximum Manhattan distance is 10 (|6-1| + |6-1| = 10)

Possible distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

Hence, H can have up to 11 elements, which the program achieves.

So, for n=2 to n=6, the program's choices achieve the maximum possible size of H.

Now, I need to generalize this for any n.

Looking at the pattern:

- For n=2: (1,1), (1,2)

- For n=3: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4) → wait, but n=3, so (2,4) is invalid, since y=4 > n=3.

Wait, hold on.

Looking back at the program:

```

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for i in range(t):

        n = int(input())

        print('1 1')

        print('1 2')

        if n == 3:

            print('2 3')

        else:

            print('2 4')

            for j in range(4, n + 1):

                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



```

Wait, for n=3, it prints (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), which is valid for n=3.

But in my earlier analysis, I mistakenly thought it chooses (2,4) for n=3, which is incorrect.

Apologies for that mistake.

So, corrected:

- For n=3: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

- For n=4: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

- For n=5: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

- For n=6: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

And so on.

So, the pattern is:

- Always choose (1,1)

- Choose (1,2)

- Choose (2,4) [but for n=3, choose (2,3) instead]

- Then, for higher n, choose (k,k) for k=4 to n

Wait, but in the program, for n >=4, it chooses (2,4), then (4,4), then (5,5), etc.

But for n=3, it chooses (2,3), which is adjusted to fit within the grid.

Is this always optimal?

Let me check for n=7:

- Program chooses: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7)

- Possible distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1

- (1,1) and (2,4): 1 + 3 = 4

- (1,1) and (4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,1) and (5,5): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,1) and (6,6): 5 + 5 = 10

- (1,1) and (7,7): 6 + 6 = 12

- (1,2) and (2,4): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2) and (4,4): 3 + 2 = 5

- (1,2) and (5,5): 4 + 3 = 7

- (1,2) and (6,6): 5 + 4 = 9

- (1,2) and (7,7): 6 + 5 = 11

- (2,4) and (4,4): 2

- (2,4) and (5,5): 3 + 1 = 4

- (2,4) and (6,6): 4 + 2 = 6

- (2,4) and (7,7): 5 + 3 = 8

- (4,4) and (5,5): 1 + 1 = 2

- (4,4) and (6,6): 2 + 2 = 4

- (4,4) and (7,7): 3 + 3 = 6

- (5,5) and (6,6): 1 + 1 = 2

- (5,5) and (7,7): 2 + 2 = 4

- (6,6) and (7,7): 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus distances to themselves: 0

- So, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}, size 13

- In a 7x7 grid, the maximum possible Manhattan distance is |7-1| + |7-1| = 12

- Possible distances: 0 to 12, total 13 possible distances

- Hence, H has size 13, which is maximum

Seems correct for n=7.

What about n=10?

- Program chooses: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,8), (9,9), (10,10)

- Distances would cover 0 up to |10-1| + |10-1| = 18

- H would have size 19 (0 to 18)

- Seems optimal

Now, is there any n where this approach fails?

Let me consider n=4 again:

- Chosen cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

- Distances: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6

- Maximum possible: 6 (|4-1| + |4-1| = 6)

- H has size 7, which is 0 to 6

Seems optimal

For n=5:

- Chosen cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

- Distances: 0 to 8

- H has size 9

- Optimal

For n=6:

- Chosen cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

- Distances: 0 to 10

- H has size 11

- Optimal

Wait, but for n=3:

- Chosen cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

- Distances: 0,1,2,3,4

- Wait, in a 3x3 grid, the maximum distance is 4 (|3-1| + |3-1| = 4)

- H has size 5 (0,1,2,3,4)

- But earlier, I thought it was 4, but actually, it should be 5

Wait, in the example for n=3, H has size 4, but actually, it can have size 5.

Wait, contradiction.

In the note for n=3:

- Choose (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

- Distances:

- (2,1)-(2,3): 2

- (2,1)-(3,1): 1

- (2,3)-(3,1): 1 + 2 = 3

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,1,2,3}, size 4

But, in a 3x3 grid, the maximum distance is 4, so H can include 0,1,2,3,4

Hence, it's possible to achieve H with size 5.

For example, choose (1,1), (1,3), (3,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,3): 2

- (1,1)-(3,3): 4

- (1,3)-(3,3): 2

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,2,4}, size 3

- Not better

Wait, earlier I thought choosing (1,1), (1,3), (3,3) gives H={0,2,4}, size 3, which is less than the previous choices.

But, is there a way to choose 3 cells to get H with size 5?

Let me think differently.

Choose (1,1), (1,2), (3,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(3,3): 4

- (1,2)-(3,3): 2 + 1 = 3

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,1,3,4}, size 4

Still size 4

Another choice: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,2): 1 + 1 = 2

- (1,1)-(3,3): 2 + 2 = 4

- (2,2)-(3,3): 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,2,4}, size 3

Not better

Another choice: (1,1), (2,3), (3,2)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,3): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,1)-(3,2): 2 + 1 = 3

- (2,3)-(3,2): 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,2,3}, size 3

Not better

Another choice: (1,1), (1,3), (2,2)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,3): 2

- (1,1)-(2,2): 1 + 1 = 2

- (1,3)-(2,2): 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,2}, size 2

Worse

Seems like in a 3x3 grid, choosing any 3 cells, the maximum H size is 4.

Wait, but earlier I thought it could be 5.

Wait, possible distances in 3x3 grid: 0,1,2,3,4

But in any selection of 3 cells, it's not possible to get all these distances.

For example:

- Choose (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

- Distances: 1, 2, 3, 4 (if you include distances to themselves: 0)

- Wait, let's calculate again:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,3): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2)-(2,3): 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,1,2,3}, size 4

Still, no 4.

Wait, but in the program's choice for n=3: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,3): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2)-(2,3): 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,1,2,3}, size 4

But in a 3x3 grid, the maximum distance is 4, but in this selection, we don't have distance 4.

Is there a way to include distance 4 in the selection?

Choose (1,1), (1,2), (3,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(3,3): 4

- (1,2)-(3,3): 2 + 1 = 3

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,1,3,4}, size 4

Still no 2

Another choice: (1,1), (2,1), (3,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,1): 1

- (1,1)-(3,3): 4

- (2,1)-(3,3): 1 + 2 = 3

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,1,3,4}, size 4

Still no 2

Another choice: (1,1), (3,1), (3,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(3,1): 2

- (1,1)-(3,3): 4

- (3,1)-(3,3): 2

- Plus 0 for each cell to itself

- H = {0,2,4}, size 3

Worse

Seems like it's impossible to have H with size 5 for n=3.

Hence, the maximum size of H for n=3 is 4, not 5.

Therefore, in my earlier analysis, I mistakenly thought that H could have size 5 for n=3, but actually, it's not possible.

Hence, for n=3, the program's choice achieves H with size 4, which is maximum.

Therefore, the program is correct for n=3.

Similarly, for higher n, it seems to achieve the maximum H size.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]
