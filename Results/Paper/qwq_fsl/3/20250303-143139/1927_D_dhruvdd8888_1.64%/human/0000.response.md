Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an array of integers and a series of queries. For each query, which specifies a range within the array, the program needs to find two indices within that range whose corresponding values are different. If such a pair exists, it should print those indices; otherwise, it should print -1 -1.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. We have an array of integers, and for each query, we're given a range defined by indices l and r (1-based). I need to check within this range if there are at least two different numbers. If there are, output any two indices (i, j) within the range where a_i != a_j; otherwise, output -1 -1.

Looking at the program, it seems to process the input in batches of test cases. For each test case, it reads N (the length of the array), the array itself, Q (the number of queries), and then the queries.

I need to analyze if this program correctly handles all possible scenarios as per the problem description.

Let me walk through the code step by step.

1. **Reading Input:**

   - It reads the number of test cases, `tc`.

   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

2. **func_1():**

   - Reads N and the array `nums`.

   - Appends -1 to `nums` to handle edge cases.

   - Initializes variables `s`, `e`, `num`, and an empty list `arr`.

   - Iterates through `nums` to group consecutive equal elements and stores the start and end indices of each group in `arr`.

   - Determines the length of `arr` as `LA`.

   - Processes each query:

     - Reads l and r.

     - Uses `bisect_left` to find the position in `arr` where the range starts.

     - Retrieves the start and end of the group at that position.

     - Based on the start and end indices, decides whether to print indices of different elements or -1 -1.

This approach seems to be using a form of grouping consecutive equal elements and then determining, for each query, whether there's a group boundary within the query's range that indicates different elements.

However, I need to verify if this logic covers all possible cases.

**Potential Issues:**

1. **1-based vs 0-based indexing:**

   - The problem uses 1-based indexing for the queries, but Python uses 0-based indexing. The program seems to handle this by adjusting indices accordingly.

2. **Edge Cases:**

   - All elements in the range are the same.

   - Only two elements in the range, which are different.

   - Range contains only one element.

   - First or last range in the array.

3. **Grouping Consecutive Elements:**

   - The program groups consecutive equal elements, but the queries can span multiple groups.

   - It needs to correctly identify if there are different elements across these groups.

4. **Handling Appended -1:**

   - The program appends -1 to `nums` to handle edge cases. I need to ensure this doesn't interfere with actual array values.

Let me think about specific examples to test the correctness.

**Test Case 1:**

- N = 5

- nums = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]

- Q = 3

- Queries: (1,5), (1,2), (1,3)

- Expected:

  - For (1,5): indices 1 and 3 (since a1=1 and a3=2 are different)

  - For (1,2): a1=1 and a2=1 are same, so -1 -1

  - For (1,3): a1=1 and a3=2 are different

The program seems to handle this correctly based on the example.

**Test Case 2:**

- N = 6

- nums = [30, 20, 20, 10, 10, 20]

- Q = 5

- Queries: (1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (3,5)

- Expected:

  - (1,2): a1=30 and a2=20 are different

  - (2,3): a2=20 and a3=20 are same, so -1 -1

  - (2,4): a2=20 and a4=10 are different

  - (2,6): a2=20 and a6=20 are same, but there are different elements in between, so need to check properly

  - (3,5): a3=20, a4=10, a5=10; so a3=20 and a4=10 are different

I need to ensure that the program correctly identifies the presence of different elements within the range, even if the start and end are the same.

**Potential Failure Case:**

Consider a range where the first and last elements are the same, but there are different elements in between.

For example:

- N = 4

- nums = [1, 2, 1, 1]

- Query: (1,4)

- Here, a1=1 and a4=1 are same, but a2=2 is different.

- The program should return any pair where elements are different, like (1,2) or (2,3).

I need to check if the program can detect this correctly.

Looking back at the code:

- It groups consecutive equal elements.

- For each query, it finds the group that includes the start index.

- If the end of that group is within the query range, it might conclude that all elements are the same.

- But in the above example, the groups would be:

  - (1,2,1)

  - (3,4,1)

- For query (1,4), it would find that the first group ends at 2, and the second group starts at 3.

- It needs to recognize that there are different groups within the range, hence different elements.

I'm not entirely sure if the current logic handles this correctly.

Let me look at another example:

- N = 3

- nums = [1, 2, 1]

- Query: (1,3)

- There are multiple pairs with different elements: (1,2), (2,3), etc.

- The program should return any of these.

Another potential issue:

- N = 2

- nums = [1, 1]

- Query: (1,2)

- All elements are the same, so should return -1 -1

- N = 2

- nums = [1, 2]

- Query: (1,2)

- Elements are different, so return 1 and 2

Seems straightforward, but I need to ensure the program handles small N correctly.

Another test case:

- N = 5

- nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]

- Query: (1,5)

- Here, a1=1 and a4=2 are different.

- The program should return any pair with different elements.

I need to verify if the program can find such a pair.

Looking back at the code:

- It groups consecutive equal elements.

- For each query, it finds the group that includes the start index.

- If the end of that group is within the query range, and the end index is less than r, it prints the start and end+1.

- If the end of the group is greater than or equal to r, it prints -1 -1.

Wait, this seems problematic.

In the example above, for N=5, nums=[1,1,1,2,1], query=(1,5):

- Groups: (1,3,1), (4,4,2), (5,5,1)

- For query (1,5):

- Start index l=1 falls in group (1,3,1)

- End of this group is 3, which is less than r=5.

- So, it should print s and e+1, which is 1 and 4.

- a1=1 and a4=2 are different, which is correct.

Seems okay in this case.

Another case:

- N=4

- nums=[1,2,1,1]

- Query=(1,4)

- Groups: (1,1,1), (2,2,2), (3,4,1)

- For query (1,4):

- Start index l=1 falls in group (1,1,1)

- End of this group is 1, which is less than r=4.

- So, it prints s and e+1, which is 1 and 2.

- a1=1 and a2=2 are different, which is correct.

Seems correct.

Another potential edge case:

- N=3

- nums=[1,1,1]

- Query=(1,3)

- All elements are the same.

- Should print -1 -1

Let's see:

- Groups: (1,3,1)

- For query (1,3):

- Start index l=1 falls in group (1,3,1)

- End of group is 3, which is equal to r=3.

- So, it prints -1 -1

Correct.

Another case:

- N=4

- nums=[1,1,2,2]

- Query=(2,4)

- Range includes a2=1, a3=2, a4=2

- So, a2=1 and a3=2 are different.

- Program's logic:

- Start index l=2 falls in group (2,2,1)

- End of group is 2, which is less than r=4.

- So, it prints s and e+1, which is 2 and 3.

- a2=1 and a3=2 are different.

Correct.

Another case:

- N=5

- nums=[1,2,1,2,1]

- Query=(1,5)

- Multiple pairs with different elements.

- Program should find any such pair.

- Groups: (1,1,1), (2,2,2), (3,3,1), (4,4,2), (5,5,1)

- For query (1,5):

- Start index l=1 falls in group (1,1,1)

- End of group is 1, which is less than r=5.

- So, it prints s and e+1, which is 1 and 2.

- a1=1 and a2=2 are different.

Correct.

Seems like the program is handling these cases correctly.

But let me think about a case where the start and end of the query are in the same group, but there are different elements in between.

Wait, in the grouping approach, if the query range is entirely within one group, it should correctly identify if there are different elements within that range.

Wait, but according to the code, if the end of the group is within the query range, and it's less than r, it prints s and e+1.

Wait, but if the group spans the entire query range, it should print -1 -1 if all elements are the same.

Wait, but in the earlier example:

- N=5

- nums=[1,1,1,2,1]

- Query=(1,5)

- Groups: (1,3,1), (4,4,2), (5,5,1)

- For query (1,5):

- Start index l=1 falls in group (1,3,1)

- End of group is 3, which is less than r=5.

- So, it prints s and e+1, which is 1 and 4.

- a1=1 and a4=2 are different.

Correct.

Another case:

- N=4

- nums=[1,1,2,2]

- Query=(1,4)

- Groups: (1,2,1), (3,4,2)

- For query (1,4):

- Start index l=1 falls in group (1,2,1)

- End of group is 2, which is less than r=4.

- So, it prints s and e+1, which is 1 and 3.

- a1=1 and a3=2 are different.

Correct.

Seems consistent.

Another potential edge case:

- N=2

- nums=[1,2]

- Query=(1,2)

- Different elements.

- Program should print 1 and 2.

According to the code:

- Groups: (1,1,1), (2,2,2)

- For query (1,2):

- Start index l=1 falls in group (1,1,1)

- End of group is 1, which is less than r=2.

- So, it prints s and e+1, which is 1 and 2.

- Correct.

Another case:

- N=2

- nums=[1,1]

- Query=(1,2)

- All elements same.

- Should print -1 -1

According to the code:

- Groups: (1,2,1)

- For query (1,2):

- Start index l=1 falls in group (1,2,1)

- End of group is 2, which is equal to r=2.

- So, it prints -1 -1

Correct.

Seems like the program handles these cases correctly.

Let me consider a case with multiple groups within the query range.

- N=5

- nums=[1,2,1,2,1]

- Query=(2,5)

- Range includes a2=2, a3=1, a4=2, a5=1

- Different elements exist.

- Program's logic:

- Start index l=2 falls in group (2,2,2)

- End of group is 2, which is less than r=5.

- So, it prints s and e+1, which is 2 and 3.

- a2=2 and a3=1 are different.

Correct.

Another case:

- N=6

- nums=[1,1,2,2,3,3]

- Query=(1,6)

- Different elements exist.

- Program's logic:

- Start index l=1 falls in group (1,2,1)

- End of group is 2, which is less than r=6.

- So, it prints s and e+1, which is 1 and 3.

- a1=1 and a3=2 are different.

Correct.

Seems solid.

Wait, but what if the query range starts at the beginning of a group and ends at the end of the same group?

- N=4

- nums=[1,1,2,2]

- Query=(1,2)

- Group: (1,2,1)

- All elements in the range are the same.

- Program should print -1 -1

According to the code:

- Start index l=1 falls in group (1,2,1)

- End of group is 2, which is equal to r=2.

- So, it prints -1 -1

Correct.

Another case:

- N=4

- nums=[1,2,1,2]

- Query=(2,4)

- Range includes a2=2, a3=1, a4=2

- Different elements exist.

- Program's logic:

- Start index l=2 falls in group (2,2,2)

- End of group is 2, which is less than r=4.

- So, it prints s and e+1, which is 2 and 3.

- a2=2 and a3=1 are different.

Correct.

Seems like the program handles this correctly.

Another potential edge case:

- N=1

- nums=[1]

- Query=(1,1)

- Only one element, so should print -1 -1

Wait, according to the problem, n >= 2, so n=1 is not possible.

- But in the code, N is read as int(input()), and the array has N elements.

- Need to confirm if n can be 1.

Looking back at the problem description:

- 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5

So, n is at least 2.

Hence, n=1 is not a concern.

Another case:

- N=2

- nums=[1,1]

- Query=(1,2)

- All elements same.

- Should print -1 -1

- As per earlier analysis, it does.

- N=2

- nums=[1,2]

- Query=(1,2)

- Different elements.

- Should print 1 and 2

- As per earlier analysis, it does.

I'm trying hard to find a case where the program fails, but so far, it seems to handle all the scenarios correctly.

Let me consider a case where the query range spans multiple groups, but all elements are the same.

Wait, is that possible?

- If there are multiple groups, that means there are different elements at some points.

- So, if the query spans multiple groups, there must be different elements.

- Hence, the only way to have all elements the same in a query range is if the range is entirely within a single group.

- The program seems to handle this correctly by checking if the end of the group is within the query range.

I think the logic is sound.

Moreover, the program appends -1 to nums to handle edge cases, but since -1 is not a possible value in the array (as per the constraints: 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), it shouldn't interfere with the actual data.

Also, the program uses bisect_left to find the position of the query's start index in the group list, which is efficient and correct.

Given that, and after testing multiple cases, I can't find a scenario where the program fails to meet the problem requirements.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]
