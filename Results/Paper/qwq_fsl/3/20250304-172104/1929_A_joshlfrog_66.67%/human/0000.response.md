Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to maximize the "beauty" of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. We have multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers. For each array, I need to rearrange its elements to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

Looking at the example:

Input:

5

3

2 1 3

3

69 69 69

5

100 54 80 43 90

4

3 4 3 3

2

2 1

Output:

2

0

57

1

1

In the first test case, with the array [2,1,3], rearranging to [1,2,3] gives a beauty of (2-1) + (3-2) = 2.

In the second test case, with all elements equal to 69, any arrangement will give a beauty of 0.

In the third test case, the output is 57, which seems to come from some specific arrangement.

I need to confirm if the provided program achieves this correctly.

Let's look at the program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for e in range(t):

l = int(input())

nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

x = 0

y = 100000000

for i in range(l):

if nums[i] > x:

x = nums[i]

if nums[i] < y:

y = nums[i]

print(x - y)

This function reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself. It then finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference.

Wait a minute, that seems too simple. The beauty is the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearrangement. But this program is just computing the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Is this correct?

Let me think about it.

Suppose I have an array [a, b, c], where a < b < c.

If I arrange it as [a, b, c], beauty is (b - a) + (c - b) = c - a.

If I arrange it as [a, c, b], beauty is (c - a) + (b - c) = b - a.

If I arrange it as [b, a, c], beauty is (a - b) + (c - a) = c - b.

If I arrange it as [b, c, a], beauty is (c - b) + (a - c) = a - b.

If I arrange it as [c, a, b], beauty is (a - c) + (b - a) = b - c.

If I arrange it as [c, b, a], beauty is (b - c) + (a - b) = a - c.

In this case, the maximum beauty is c - a, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

Wait, in the first test case, [1,2,3], beauty is 2, which is 3 - 1.

In the second test case, all elements are equal, so difference is 0.

In the third test case, if the array is [43,54,80,90,100], arranged as [43,100,54,90,80], beauty is (100-43) + (54-100) + (90-54) + (80-90) = 57.

Wait, 100 - 43 = 57, 54 - 100 = -46, 90 - 54 = 36, 80 - 90 = -10.

Sum is 57 -46 + 36 -10 = 57 -46 = 11, then 11 + 36 = 47, then 47 -10 = 37.

But the expected output is 57. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the sum is just the absolute differences, but the problem says (a_i - a_{i-1}), so it's not absolute.

But in the first test case, it's 2, which is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, perhaps the maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the array in ascending or descending order.

Let me check.

If the array is sorted in ascending order, beauty is (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) = an - a1.

Similarly, if sorted in descending order, beauty is (a1 - a2) + (a2 - a3) + ... + (a_{n-1} - an) = a1 - an.

So, the maximum beauty would be max(an - a1, a1 - an), which is simply |a1 - an|.

But in the third test case, the output is 57, which is 100 - 43 = 57.

So, it seems that the maximum beauty is indeed the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought of arranging the array in different orders to get higher sums, but perhaps those arrangements don't actually increase the sum beyond the difference between max and min.

Let me think again.

Suppose I have [a, b, c], a < b < c.

Arrangement [a, b, c]: beauty = (b - a) + (c - b) = c - a.

Arrangement [a, c, b]: beauty = (c - a) + (b - c) = b - a.

Arrangement [b, a, c]: beauty = (a - b) + (c - a) = c - b.

Arrangement [b, c, a]: beauty = (c - b) + (a - c) = a - b.

Arrangement [c, a, b]: beauty = (a - c) + (b - a) = b - c.

Arrangement [c, b, a]: beauty = (b - c) + (a - b) = a - c.

Among these, the maximum is c - a.

So, indeed, the maximum beauty is c - a, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

Hence, the program is correct.

Wait, but in the third test case, the output is 57, which matches 100 - 43 = 57.

So, it seems correct.

Is there any case where this wouldn't hold?

Let me think about an array with all elements equal.

Say [5,5,5,5]. Then, no matter how you arrange, all differences are 0, so beauty is 0.

The program would compute 5 - 5 = 0, which is correct.

Another case: [1,100]. Beauty is 100 - 1 = 99.

Arrangement [1,100]: beauty = 100 - 1 = 99.

Arrangement [100,1]: beauty = 1 - 100 = -99.

So, the maximum is 99.

The program would compute max - min = 100 - 1 = 99.

Correct.

Another case: [1,2,3,4,5].

Arrangement [1,2,3,4,5]: beauty = 4.

Arrangement [1,3,5,2,4]: beauty = (3-1) + (5-3) + (2-5) + (4-2) = 2 + 2 -3 + 2 = 3.

Arrangement [5,4,3,2,1]: beauty = (4-5) + (3-4) + (2-3) + (1-2) = -1 -1 -1 -1 = -4.

So, the maximum is 4, which is 5 - 1 = 4.

Wait, but according to my earlier conclusion, it should be 5 - 1 = 4.

But in the first test case, it's 2, which is 3 - 1 = 2.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but in this arrangement [1,3,5,2,4], beauty is 3, which is less than 4.

So, the maximum is indeed 4.

Hence, the program is correct.

Is there any edge case where this might not hold?

Let me consider an array with two elements.

Say [2,1]. Beauty can be (1 - 2) = -1 or (2 - 1) = 1.

So, maximum is 1, which is max - min = 2 - 1 = 1.

Correct.

Another case: [1,1]. Beauty is 0 in both arrangements.

Program would compute 1 - 1 = 0.

Correct.

Another case: [1,2,1].

Possible arrangements:

[1,1,2]: beauty = (1-1) + (2-1) = 0 + 1 = 1.

[1,2,1]: beauty = (2-1) + (1-2) = 1 -1 = 0.

[2,1,1]: beauty = (1-2) + (1-1) = -1 + 0 = -1.

Maximum is 1, which is 2 - 1 = 1.

Correct.

Seems like in all cases, the maximum beauty is indeed max - min.

Therefore, the program is correct.

I can't find any case where this wouldn't hold.

Hence, Correctness: **True**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the "beauty" of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

### Approach
1. **Understanding Beauty Calculation**:
    - For an array \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \), the beauty is \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).
    - This simplifies to \( a_n - a_1 \) when the array is sorted in ascending order.
    - Similarly, arranging in descending order gives \( a_1 - a_n \).
    - The maximum beauty is the maximum of these two, which is \( \max(a_n - a_1, a_1 - a_n) = |a_n - a_1| \).

2. **Solution Code**:
    ```python
    def func():
        t = int(input())
        for _ in range(t):
            l = int(input())
            nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
            x = max(nums)
            y = min(nums)
            print(x - y)
    ```

### Explanation
- **Reading Input**:
    - The number of test cases \( t \) is read first.
    - For each test case, the length of the array \( n \) is read, followed by the array elements.

- **Finding Maximum and Minimum**:
    - For each test case, we find the maximum and minimum values in the array.

- **Calculating Beauty**:
    - The maximum beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, as this difference is the highest possible sum of consecutive differences.

- **Output**:
    - For each test case, we print the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

This approach ensures that we achieve the maximum possible beauty for any given array by leveraging the properties of sorted arrays and difference sums.
