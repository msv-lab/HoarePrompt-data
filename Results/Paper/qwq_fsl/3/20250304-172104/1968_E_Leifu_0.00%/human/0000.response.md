Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between chosen cells in an n x n grid. The program needs to be evaluated for multiple test cases, each with different values of n.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The goal is to select n cells in an n x n grid such that the number of unique Manhattan distances between any pair of these cells is maximized. The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

Looking at the examples provided:

- For n=2, the output is two cells: (1,1) and (1,2), which gives Manhattan distances of 0, 0, and 1, resulting in a unique set {0,1}.

- For n=3, the output is three cells: (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), giving distances that result in {0,1,2,3}.

- Similar outputs are given for n=4, n=5, and n=6.

Now, the provided program is:

```

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

print('1 1')

print('1 2')

if n == 3:

print('2 3')

else:

print('2 4')

for j in range(4, n + 1):

print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



```

I need to determine if this program correctly maximizes the number of unique Manhattan distances for any given n between 2 and 1000.

Let's analyze the program step by step.

1. It reads the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case:

- Reads n.

- Prints (1,1) and (1,2).

- If n == 3, prints (2,3).

- Else, prints (2,4).

- For j from 4 to n, prints (j,j).

So, the chosen cells are:

- For n=2: (1,1), (1,2)

- For n=3: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

- For n=4: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

- For n=5: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

- And so on, up to n=1000.

I need to verify if this selection of cells maximizes the number of unique Manhattan distances for all possible n.

First, let's consider small values of n and see if the program's output matches the expected maximum number of unique distances.

For n=2:

- Chosen cells: (1,1), (1,2)

- Distances: |1-1| + |1-1| = 0

- |1-1| + |2-1| = 1

- |1-1| + |2-2| = 0

- Unique distances: {0,1}

- Is this the maximum? For n=2, the maximum possible unique distances seem to be 2, which matches.

For n=3:

- Chosen cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

- Calculate all pairwise distances:

- (1,1) to (1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 1

- (1,1) to (2,3): |1-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2) to (2,3): |1-2| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Unique distances: {1,2,3}

- But in the example, they have {0,1,2,3}. Wait, their example has (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), which gives:

- (2,1) to (2,3): |2-2| + |1-3| = 2

- (2,1) to (3,1): |2-3| + |1-1| = 1

- (2,3) to (3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3

- Unique distances: {1,2,3}

- But they also include 0, which is the distance from a cell to itself, but since we're choosing distinct cells, distance 0 shouldn't be considered.

- So perhaps there's confusion about whether to include 0 or not.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "between any pair of cells", which implies distinct pairs, so distance 0 shouldn't be included.

In the first example, they have {0,1}, but according to that, it should be {1} for n=2. Maybe they are including distance 0 for the same cell, but since we are choosing n distinct cells, distances are between different cells, so 0 shouldn't be considered.

I need to clarify this.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Let H be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells."

Does "any pair of cells" include pairs of the same cell? Typically, in such problems, "pairs" mean distinct pairs unless specified otherwise.

In programming contests, when dealing with pairs, it's usually unordered pairs without repetition.

So, likely, distances should be between distinct pairs, so 0 shouldn't be included.

However, in the example, they have {0,1}, but according to this, it should be {1}.

Wait, perhaps they are including distance 0 for the same cell, but as per the problem, it's between chosen cells, which should be distinct.

This is confusing.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"between any pair of cells"

I think it's safe to assume that it's between distinct pairs, so 0 shouldn't be included.

Therefore, for n=2, unique distances should be {1}.

But in their example, they have {0,1}, which might be a mistake in the example.

Similarly, for n=3, their example shows {0,1,2,3}, but it should be {1,2,3}.

So perhaps the examples are inclusive of distance 0, but in reality, it should not be included.

I need to proceed with the assumption that distances are between distinct pairs, hence 0 is not included.

Now, back to the program's output.

For n=2: {1}, which seems correct.

For n=3: {1,2,3}, which seems correct based on their example, assuming that 0 is not included.

For n=4: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

Calculate distances:

- (1,1) to (1,2): 1

- (1,1) to (2,4): 1 + 3 = 4

- (1,1) to (4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,2) to (2,4): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2) to (4,4): 3 + 2 = 5

- (2,4) to (4,4): 2 + 0 = 2

Unique distances: {1,2,3,4,5,6}

Seems reasonable.

For n=5: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

Calculate distances:

- (1,1) to (1,2): 1

- (1,1) to (2,4): 1 + 3 = 4

- (1,1) to (4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,1) to (5,5): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,2) to (2,4): 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2) to (4,4): 3 + 2 = 5

- (1,2) to (5,5): 4 + 3 = 7

- (2,4) to (4,4): 2 + 0 = 2

- (2,4) to (5,5): 3 + 1 = 4

- (4,4) to (5,5): 1 + 1 = 2

Unique distances: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

Again, seems comprehensive.

Similarly, for n=6: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)

Following the pattern, it should generate distances up to 10.

This seems to be a strategy where after choosing (1,1) and (1,2), it chooses cells along the diagonal (j,j) starting from j=4 up to j=n, and for n=3, it chooses (2,3), and for n=4 and above, it chooses (2,4).

I need to verify if this selection maximizes the number of unique distances for all n.

Let me consider n=3 again.

Their program outputs: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

Distances: {1,2,3}

Is there a better selection that gives more unique distances?

Let's try another selection:

- (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (2,2): 1 + 1 = 2

- (1,1) to (3,3): 2 + 2 = 4

- (2,2) to (3,3): 1 + 1 = 2

Unique distances: {2,4}

Which is fewer than the program's selection {1,2,3}

Another selection: (1,1), (1,3), (3,1)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,3): 2

- (1,1) to (3,1): 2

- (1,3) to (3,1): 2 + 2 = 4

Unique distances: {2,4}

Again, fewer than the program's selection.

Another selection: (1,1), (2,1), (3,2)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (2,1): 1

- (1,1) to (3,2): 2 + 1 = 3

- (2,1) to (3,2): 1 + 1 = 2

Unique distances: {1,2,3}

Same as the program's selection.

So, the program's selection is optimal for n=3.

For n=4:

Program's selection: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

Unique distances: {1,2,3,4,5,6}

Is there a better selection?

Let's try: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (2,2): 1 + 1 = 2

- (1,1) to (3,3): 2 + 2 = 4

- (1,1) to (4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (2,2) to (3,3): 1 + 1 = 2

- (2,2) to (4,4): 2 + 2 = 4

- (3,3) to (4,4): 1 + 1 = 2

Unique distances: {2,4,6}

Which is fewer than the program's selection.

Another selection: (1,1), (1,4), (4,1), (4,4)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,4): 3

- (1,1) to (4,1): 3

- (1,1) to (4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,4) to (4,1): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,4) to (4,4): 3 + 0 = 3

- (4,1) to (4,4): 0 + 3 = 3

Unique distances: {3,6}

Again, fewer than the program's selection.

Seems like the program's selection is better.

Is there any selection that can give more than 6 unique distances for n=4?

Let's see:

Total possible pairs for n=4: C(4,2) = 6 pairs.

So, maximum unique distances is 6, which the program achieves.

Hence, for n=4, it's optimal.

For n=5:

Program's selection: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

Unique distances: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

Is there a better selection?

Total pairs: C(5,2) = 10 pairs.

Is it possible to get more than 8 unique distances?

Let's try another selection:

(1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5)

As per the example, but in the program, it's different.

Wait, the program selects (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

Which gives 8 unique distances.

Is there a selection that gives more than 8?

Let's try: (1,1), (1,5), (3,3), (5,1), (5,5)

Distances:

- (1,1) to (1,5): 4

- (1,1) to (3,3): 2 + 2 = 4

- (1,1) to (5,1): 4

- (1,1) to (5,5): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,5) to (3,3): 2 + 2 = 4

- (1,5) to (5,1): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,5) to (5,5): 4

- (3,3) to (5,1): 2 + 2 = 4

- (3,3) to (5,5): 2 + 2 = 4

- (5,1) to (5,5): 4

Unique distances: {4,8}

Which is worse.

Another selection: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)

Distances:

- All pairwise distances are multiples of sqrt(2), but since it's Manhattan distance, it's |x差| + |y差|

- For example, (1,1) to (2,2): 1 + 1 = 2

- (1,1) to (3,3): 2 + 2 = 4

- (1,1) to (4,4): 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,1) to (5,5): 4 + 4 = 8

- (2,2) to (3,3): 1 + 1 = 2

- (2,2) to (4,4): 2 + 2 = 4

- (2,2) to (5,5): 3 + 3 = 6

- (3,3) to (4,4): 1 + 1 = 2

- (3,3) to (5,5): 2 + 2 = 4

- (4,4) to (5,5): 1 + 1 = 2

Unique distances: {2,4,6,8}

Which is {2,4,6,8}, which is fewer than the program's selection of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

So, the program's selection seems better.

Is there a selection that can give more than 8 unique distances for n=5?

Let's see:

Total pairs: C(5,2) = 10 pairs.

So, maximum unique distances is 10.

But the program achieves only 8.

Is it possible to get 10 unique distances?

Let me try selecting cells to maximize the spread of distances.

Suppose we select cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5)

As per the program.

Distances: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

Missing 9 and 10.

Is it possible to include 9 and 10?

For n=5, the maximum possible Manhattan distance is from (1,1) to (5,5): 8.

So, 9 and 10 are not possible.

Hence, 8 unique distances seem to be the maximum achievable.

Wait, for n=5, the maximum distance is 8, not 10.

Manhattan distance ranges from 1 to 8 for n=5.

Hence, 8 unique distances are achievable, and the program achieves this.

Therefore, for n=5, the program's selection is optimal.

Similarly, for n=6:

Program's selection: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)

Wait, in the example, it's:

1 4

1 5

1 6

5 2

5 5

6 1

Let's calculate the distances:

- (1,4) to (1,5): 1

- (1,4) to (1,6): 2

- (1,4) to (5,2): 4 + 2 = 6

- (1,4) to (5,5): 4 + 1 = 5

- (1,4) to (6,1): 5 + 3 = 8

- (1,5) to (1,6): 1

- (1,5) to (5,2): 4 + 3 = 7

- (1,5) to (5,5): 4

- (1,5) to (6,1): 5 + 4 = 9

- (1,6) to (5,2): 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,6) to (5,5): 4 + 1 = 5

- (1,6) to (6,1): 5 + 5 = 10

- (5,2) to (5,5): 3

- (5,2) to (6,1): 1 + 1 = 2

- (5,5) to (6,1): 1 + 4 = 5

Unique distances: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}

So, 10 unique distances for n=6.

Is this the maximum possible?

For n=6, the maximum possible Manhattan distance is from (1,1) to (6,6): 10.

So, distances can range from 1 to 10.

If we can achieve all distances from 1 to 10, that's optimal.

The program achieves this.

Is there a better selection that can achieve more than 10 unique distances? No, because the maximum possible distance is 10, and distances are integers from 1 to 10.

Hence, the program's selection is optimal for n=6.

Looking back at the program:

For n >=4, it selects (1,1), (1,2), then (2,4), and then (j,j) for j from 4 to n.

Wait, in the last example for n=6, it's selecting (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1), which is different from the pattern described earlier.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking back at the program:

```

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

print('1 1')

print('1 2')

if n == 3:

print('2 3')

else:

print('2 4')

for j in range(4, n + 1):

print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



```

Wait, for n=6, according to this program, it should output:

1 1

1 2

2 4

4 4

5 5

6 6

But in the example, it's showing:

1 4

1 5

1 6

5 2

5 5

6 1

Which is different.

Perhaps there's confusion.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says:

"Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work as expected then Correctness False."

So, if the program doesn't match the expected output for any test case, it's incorrect.

In the example for n=6, the program's output is different from what's provided in the explanation.

Wait, but according to the program code, for n=6, it should output:

1 1

1 2

2 4

4 4

5 5

6 6

But in the example, it's showing:

1 4

1 5

1 6

5 2

5 5

6 1

Which doesn't match the program's output.

This is confusing.

Perhaps the example output is just an illustration, and the program is supposed to output a different set of cells.

But according to the problem, for each test case, we need to output n points that maximize the size of H.

So, multiple selections can achieve the same maximum number of unique distances.

Hence, the program's selection, as long as it achieves the maximum unique distances, is acceptable.

In the earlier analysis, for n=6, the program's selection achieves all distances from 1 to 10, which is optimal.

Similarly, for n=5, it achieves distances from 1 to 8.

Wait, but for n=5, according to the program, it should output:

1 1

1 2

2 4

4 4

5 5

Which, as calculated earlier, achieves distances {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}.

Is there a way to achieve more than 8 unique distances for n=5? No, because the maximum possible Manhattan distance is 8.

Hence, the program's selection is optimal.

Similarly, for n=4, it outputs:

1 1

1 2

2 4

4 4

Which achieves distances {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

Is there a way to achieve more than 6 unique distances for n=4? No, because the maximum possible Manhattan distance is 6, and there are only 6 pairs.

Hence, the program's selection is optimal.

For n=3:

1 1

1 2

2 3

Which achieves distances {1,2,3}.

Is there a way to achieve more than 3 unique distances for n=3? No, because the maximum possible Manhattan distance is 4, but achieving 4 would require a specific selection.

Wait, for n=3, the maximum possible Manhattan distance is from (1,1) to (3,3): 4.

But to achieve unique distances {1,2,3,4}, we need to select cells such that all these distances are covered.

In the program's selection, for n=3: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

Distances: {1,2,3}

Is there a selection that achieves {1,2,3,4}?

Let's try: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

Distances: {2,4}

Which is
