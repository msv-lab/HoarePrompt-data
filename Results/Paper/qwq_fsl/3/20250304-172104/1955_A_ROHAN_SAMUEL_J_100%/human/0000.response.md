Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to calculate the minimum cost for buying exactly n yogurts, given the regular price per yogurt and a promotional price for two yogurts. The program needs to handle multiple test cases, and for each case, output the minimum cost.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. The price of one yogurt is 'a' burles, and the promotional price for two yogurts is 'b' burles. Maxim wants to buy exactly 'n' yogurts, and I need to find the minimum amount he should spend.

Let's consider some examples to grasp the logic:

1. If n=2, a=5, b=9:

- Buying two yogurts using the promotion: 9 burles.

- Buying two yogurts individually: 5*2=10 burles.

- So, the minimum is 9 burles.

2. If n=3, a=5, b=9:

- Option 1: Buy one yogurt individually and two with promotion: 5 + 9 = 14 burles.

- Option 2: Buy three yogurts individually: 5*3=15 burles.

- So, the minimum is 14 burles.

3. If n=3, a=5, b=11:

- Option 1: Buy one yogurt individually and use the promotion for two: 5 + 11 = 16 burles.

- Option 2: Buy three yogurts individually: 5*3=15 burles.

- So, the minimum is 15 burles.

4. If n=4, a=5, b=11:

- Option 1: Buy two pairs with promotion: 11*2=22 burles.

- Option 2: Buy four yogurts individually: 5*4=20 burles.

- So, the minimum is 20 burles.

From these examples, it seems that the program should choose between buying yogurts individually or in pairs based on which option is cheaper.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```python

def func():

    for _ in range(int(input())):

        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

        if n % 2:

            if 2 * a < b:

                print(a * n)

            else:

                print(n // 2 * b + a)

        elif 2 * a < b:

            print(a * n)

        else:

            print(n // 2 * b)

```

I need to verify if this program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case.

Let's break down the logic:

1. If n is odd:

- Check if buying two yogurts individually (2*a) is cheaper than buying them with the promotion (b).

- If 2*a < b, then it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually.

- Else, buy as many pairs as possible with the promotion and buy the remaining single yogurt individually.

2. If n is even:

- Check if buying two yogurts individually (2*a) is cheaper than buying them with the promotion (b).

- If 2*a < b, buy all yogurts individually.

- Else, buy all yogurts in pairs with the promotion.

Wait a minute, this seems a bit off.

In the odd case, the program checks if 2*a < b. If true, it buys all yogurts individually: a*n.

If false, it buys n//2 pairs with the promotion and one single yogurt individually: (n//2)*b + a.

In the even case, if 2*a < b, buy all individually: a*n.

Else, buy all in pairs with the promotion: (n//2)*b.

Let me test this logic with the examples from the problem:

Example 1:

n=2, a=5, b=9

- n is even.

- Check if 2*5 < 9: 10 < 9 is False.

- So, print(n//2 * b): 1*9=9.

- Correct, as per the sample output.

Example 2:

n=3, a=5, b=9

- n is odd.

- Check if 2*5 < 9: 10 < 9 is False.

- So, print(n//2 * b + a): 1*9 + 5 = 14.

- Correct, matches sample output.

Example 3:

n=3, a=5, b=11

- n is odd.

- Check if 2*5 < 11: 10 < 11 is True.

- So, print(a*n): 5*3=15.

- Correct, matches sample output.

Example 4:

n=4, a=5, b=11

- n is even.

- Check if 2*5 < 11: 10 < 11 is True.

- So, print(a*n): 5*4=20.

- Correct, matches sample output.

So far, so good. But I need to make sure this logic works for all possible cases, not just these examples.

Let's consider some edge cases:

1. n=1:

- n is odd.

- Check if 2*a < b: but n=1, so n//2=0.

- So, it would print(0*b + a)=a.

- Which is correct: only one yogurt, so cost is a.

2. n=0:

- But according to the problem, n >=1, as per the constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.

- So, n=0 is not possible.

3. When a*2 == b:

- For even n:

- Since 2*a == b, it's indifferent to buy individually or in pairs.

- The program will choose to buy in pairs: n//2 * b.

- For odd n:

- It will buy n//2 pairs and one individual yogurt: (n//2)*b + a.

- Which is optimal, as buying in pairs is as cheap as buying individually.

4. When a*2 > b:

- For even n:

- If 2*a > b, it's cheaper to buy in pairs.

- The program will print(n//2 * b).

- For odd n:

- It's cheaper to buy as many pairs as possible and one individual yogurt.

- The program does that: (n//2)*b + a.

Seems correct.

Wait, but in the odd case, when 2*a < b, the program buys all individually, which might not be optimal.

Wait, in the odd case, if 2*a < b, it's cheaper to buy all individually.

Is that always true?

Let me think.

Suppose n is odd, say n=3.

Option 1: Buy one pair with promotion and one individually: b + a.

Option 2: Buy all three individually: 3*a.

If 2*a < b, then 3*a < b + a → 3*a < b + a → 2*a < b, which is the condition.

So, if 2*a < b, then 3*a < b + a, meaning buying all individually is cheaper than buying one pair and one individual.

Hence, the program's logic seems correct.

Another edge case:

n=5, a=3, b=7.

- n is odd.

- Check if 2*3 < 7: 6 < 7 is True.

- So, buy all individually: 5*3=15.

- Alternative options:

- Buy two pairs and one individual: 7*2 + 3=17.

- Buy one pair and three individually: 7 + 3*3=16.

- All individually: 15.

- So, 15 is the cheapest.

Another case:

n=5, a=4, b=7.

- n is odd.

- Check if 2*4 < 7: 8 < 7 is False.

- So, buy two pairs and one individual: 2*7 + 4=18.

- Alternative options:

- Buy all individually: 5*4=20.

- Buy one pair and three individually: 7 + 3*4=19.

- So, 18 is the cheapest.

Program's output: 18, which is correct.

Another case:

n=4, a=3, b=5.

- n is even.

- Check if 2*3 < 5: 6 < 5 is False.

- So, buy two pairs: 2*5=10.

- Alternative:

- Buy four individually: 4*3=12.

- So, 10 is cheaper, correct.

Another case:

n=4, a=2, b=4.

- n is even.

- Check if 2*2 < 4: 4 < 4 is False.

- So, buy two pairs: 2*4=8.

- Alternative:

- Buy four individually: 4*2=8.

- Both same, so 8 is correct.

Another case:

n=4, a=1, b=2.

- n is even.

- Check if 2*1 < 2: 2 < 2 is False.

- Wait, 2 is not less than 2.

- So, 2 <= 2.

- Wait, the condition is 2*a < b.

- Here, 2*1 = 2, which is equal to b=2.

- So, 2*a < b is False.

- So, buy two pairs: 2*2=4.

- Alternative:

- Buy four individually: 4*1=4.

- Both same, so 4 is correct.

Seems correct.

Another case:

n=3, a=2, b=4.

- n is odd.

- Check if 2*2 < 4: 4 < 4 is False.

- So, buy one pair and one individual: 1*4 + 2=6.

- Alternative:

- Buy all three individually: 3*2=6.

- Both same, so 6 is correct.

Another case:

n=3, a=2, b=3.

- n is odd.

- Check if 2*2 < 3: 4 < 3 is False.

- So, buy one pair and one individual: 1*3 + 2=5.

- Alternative:

- Buy all three individually: 3*2=6.

- So, 5 is cheaper, correct.

Another case:

n=3, a=1, b=2.

- n is odd.

- Check if 2*1 < 2: 2 < 2 is False.

- So, buy one pair and one individual: 1*2 +1=3.

- Alternative:

- Buy all three individually: 3*1=3.

- Both same, so 3 is correct.

Seems consistent.

Wait, let's consider a case where buying in pairs is much cheaper.

n=6, a=5, b=7.

- n is even.

- Check if 2*5 < 7: 10 < 7 is False.

- So, buy three pairs: 3*7=21.

- Alternative:

- Buy six individually: 6*5=30.

- So, 21 is cheaper, correct.

Another case:

n=5, a=5, b=7.

- n is odd.

- Check if 2*5 < 7: 10 < 7 is False.

- So, buy two pairs and one individual: 2*7 +5=19.

- Alternative:

- Buy three pairs and subtract one: but can't do that.

- Buy one pair and three individually: 7 + 3*5=22.

- Buy all five individually: 25.

- So, 19 is the cheapest.

Correct.

Another case:

n=2, a=4, b=7.

- n is even.

- Check if 2*4 < 7: 8 < 7 is False.

- So, buy one pair: 7.

- Alternative:

- Buy two individually: 8.

- So, 7 is cheaper, correct.

Another case:

n=2, a=1, b=2.

- n is even.

- Check if 2*1 < 2: 2 < 2 is False.

- So, buy one pair: 2.

- Alternative:

- Buy two individually: 2.

- Both same, so 2 is correct.

Seems fine.

Wait, what if n is 1:

n=1, a=5, b=9.

- n is odd.

- Check if 2*5 < 9: 10 < 9 is False.

- So, buy zero pairs and one individual: 0*9 +5=5.

- Correct, as you can't buy a pair with n=1.

Another case:

n=1, a=3, b=5.

- n is odd.

- Check if 2*3 < 5: 6 < 5 is False.

- So, buy zero pairs and one individual: 0*5 +3=3.

- Correct.

Seems correct.

I can't find any case where this logic fails. It handles both even and odd n correctly, and makes the right choice between buying individually or in pairs based on the comparison of 2*a and b.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
