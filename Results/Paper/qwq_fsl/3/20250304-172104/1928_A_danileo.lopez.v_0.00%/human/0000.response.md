Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

First, let's understand the problem description. Bob has a rectangle of size a x b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The goal is to determine if he can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

The program provided is:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

I need to verify if this program correctly determines whether Bob can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one based on the given conditions.

Let's break down the problem and the solution.

### Understanding the Problem

1. **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
2. **Operation**:
   - Bob cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
   - From these two smaller rectangles, he tries to form a new rectangle.
3. **Output**: "Yes" if he can form a new rectangle different from the original (considering rotations), otherwise "No".

### Analyzing the Program

The program checks if either a or b is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

### Key Insights

1. **Cutting the Rectangle**:
   - Cutting parallel to the longer side will result in two rectangles with one dimension unchanged and the other dimension reduced.
   - For example, cutting a 2x6 rectangle parallel to the shorter side (length 2) will result in two 2x3 rectangles.

2. **Forming a New Rectangle**:
   - From two smaller rectangles, Bob can arrange them in different ways to form a new rectangle.
   - The new rectangle should be different from the original one, considering that rotations do not make a difference.

3. **Condition for "Yes"**:
   - If either a or b is even, the program claims it's possible to form a new rectangle.

### Evaluating the Program

I need to verify if the condition "if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0" is sufficient to determine whether a new rectangle can be formed.

#### Case 1: Both a and b are odd.

- Example: a = 3, b = 5
- Cutting parallel to the shorter side (length 3):
  - Two rectangles of 3x2 and 3x3
  - Trying to form a new rectangle:
    - Arranging them side by side: 3x(2+3) = 3x5 (original)
    - Stacking them: (3+3)x2 = 6x2
    - But 6x2 is different from 3x5, so it should be "Yes"
- However, according to the program, since both are odd, it prints "No"

Wait, this seems contradictory. The program says "No" for both odd dimensions, but in this case, it's possible to form a new rectangle (6x2 vs. 3x5).

#### Case 2: One dimension is even.

- Example: a = 2, b = 6
- Cutting parallel to the shorter side (length 2):
  - Two rectangles of 2x3
  - Arranging them side by side: 2x6 (original)
  - Stacking them: 4x3
  - 4x3 is different from 2x6, so "Yes"
- Cutting parallel to the longer side (length 6):
  - Two rectangles of 1x6 and 1x6
  - Arranging them side by side: 1x12
  - Stacking them: 2x6 (original)
  - 1x12 is different from 2x6, so "Yes"

#### Case 3: Both dimensions are even.

- Example: a = 4, b = 4
- Cutting parallel to any side:
  - Cutting parallel to side 4:
    - Two rectangles of 2x4
    - Arranging them side by side: 2x8
    - Stacking them: 4x4 (original)
    - 2x8 is different from 4x4, so "Yes"
- Alternatively, cutting into two 4x2 rectangles:
  - Arranging them side by side: 4x4 (original)
  - Stacking them: 8x2
  - 8x2 is different from 4x4, so "Yes"

#### Case 4: One dimension is 1.

- Example: a = 1, b = 1
- Cannot be cut into two rectangles, so "No"
- Example: a = 1, b = 2
- Cutting parallel to side 1:
  - Two rectangles of 1x1
  - Arranging them side by side: 1x2 (original)
  - Stacking them: 2x1 (same as 1x2)
  - No new rectangle, so "No"

### Conclusion

From the above cases:

- When both a and b are odd, it's still possible to form a new rectangle different from the original, but the program incorrectly returns "No".

- When at least one dimension is even, the program correctly returns "Yes", as it's possible to form a new rectangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to account for cases where both dimensions are odd but still allows for the formation of a new rectangle.

### Final Answer

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{False}} \]

### Explanation

The program incorrectly returns "No" when both dimensions are odd, even though in some cases, it's possible to form a new rectangle different from the original. For example, with a=3 and b=5, cutting the rectangle and rearranging the pieces can result in a 6x2 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x5 rectangle. Hence, the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements for all potential cases.
