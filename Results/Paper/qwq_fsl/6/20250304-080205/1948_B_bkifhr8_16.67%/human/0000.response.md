Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether it's possible to make a given array sorted in non-descending order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows deleting any element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. We have an array of integers, and I can perform operations on elements that are at least 10. Each operation involves deleting such an element and inserting its digits in its place. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67], and I apply the operation to 12, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. Similarly, applying it to 45 would result in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67].

The goal is to make the array sorted in non-descending order using these operations any number of times, possibly zero.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
```

I need to verify if this program correctly solves the problem as described.

Let's break down the program:

1. It reads the number of test cases, `t`.

2. For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of elements in the array) and the array itself, `list1`.

3. It then iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1) to the end.

4. For each element, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current one and if the previous element is greater than 10.

5. If both conditions are met, it deletes the previous element and inserts its tens digit at that position and its units digit immediately after.

6. After performing these operations, it checks if the modified array is sorted using `func_1`, which simply checks if the array is equal to its sorted version.

7. Based on the result, it prints "Yes" or "No".

First observation: The program only performs the operation once for each pair where the previous element is greater than the current one and is greater than 10. It doesn't repeatedly apply the operation until no more operations are needed.

But according to the problem, operations can be performed any number of times. So, this might be a issue because maybe one application is not enough to sort the array, and multiple applications are required.

Let me think about an example.

Consider the input:

2

[21, 12, 34]

Initially, 21 > 12 and 21 > 10, so it splits 21 into 2 and 1, resulting in [2, 1, 12, 34].

Now, check if this array is sorted: 2 <= 1 <= 12 <= 34. No, because 1 < 2.

So, according to the program, it would print "No". But is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split 21 into [2,1], and then split 12 into [1,2], we get [2,1,1,2,34], which is not sorted.

Alternatively, if we split 34 into [3,4], we get [2,1,1,2,3,4], which is not sorted.

Wait, but maybe there's another way.

Wait, perhaps the program is not correctly implementing the operation because it only performs the operation once for each problematic pair.

Maybe I need to find a case where performing the operation multiple times could sort the array, but the program only performs it once.

Let's consider another example.

Input:

3

[100, 10, 1]

The program will iterate from the second element:

- Check if 100 > 10 and 100 > 10: yes.

- Split 100 into 1, 0, 0.

- So, the array becomes [1, 0, 0, 10, 1].

- Now, check if this is sorted: 1 <= 0 <= 0 <= 10 <= 1? No, because 0 <= 0 <= 10 <= 1 is invalid.

- The program would print "No".

But is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split 100 into [1,0,0], and then split 10 into [1,0], we get [1,0,0,1,0,1].

This is [1,0,0,1,0,1], which is not sorted.

Alternatively, if we split 1 first, but since 1 < 10, maybe other operations.

It seems tricky, but perhaps the program's approach is insufficient.

Another consideration: The problem allows performing operations any number of times, including zero. So, the program should consider all possible sequences of operations.

But the given program only performs the operation once for each pair where the previous element is greater than the current one and is greater than 10.

This seems too simplistic and likely incorrect.

Let me consider the examples provided in the problem description.

First example:

Input:

4

12 3 45 67

According to the note, splitting the first element 12 results in [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted.

The program, if it splits 12, should recognize that 12 > 3 and 12 > 10, so it splits 12 into [1,2], resulting in [1,2,3,45,67], which is sorted. So, it should print "Yes".

Second example:

Input:

3

12 28 5

According to the note, it's not possible to make it sorted.

The program needs to determine that no sequence of operations can make it sorted.

Third example:

Input:

2

0 0

Already sorted, so no operation needed. Should print "Yes".

So, for these specific examples, the program might work, but I need to think of other cases where it might fail.

Another concern: The program only performs the operation for elements that are greater than 10 and where the previous element is greater than the current one.

But perhaps there are cases where you need to perform operations on elements that are greater than 10 even if the previous element is not greater than the current one, in order to achieve a fully sorted array.

For instance:

Input:

2

[15, 10]

Here, 15 > 10, and 15 > 10, so it splits 15 into [1,5], resulting in [1,5,10].

This is sorted: 1 <= 5 <= 10. So, it should print "Yes".

But according to the program, it would split 15 and get [1,5,10], which is sorted, so it should print "Yes".

Another case:

Input:

3

[21, 21, 21]

If we don't perform any operations, it's already sorted.

But if we perform operations on any 21, it splits into [2,1], so [2,1,21,21], which is not sorted.

But since the problem allows performing operations any number of times, including zero, and in this case, zero operations suffice, it should print "Yes".

Now, a potentially problematic case:

Input:

3

[12, 13, 14]

If we split 12, we get [1,2,13,14], which is sorted.

If we don't split any, it's 12 <= 13 <= 14, which is sorted.

So, it should print "Yes".

But what if we have:

3

[12, 2, 13]

Initially, 12 > 2, so it splits 12 into [1,2], resulting in [1,2,2,13], which is sorted. So, "Yes".

Another case:

3

[23, 1, 10]

Split 23 into [2,3], resulting in [2,3,1,10].

Now, 3 > 1, so it would split 3 (but 3 < 10, so operation cannot be performed on 3).

So, the array remains [2,3,1,10], which is not sorted.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split 23 into [2,3], and then consider splitting 10 into [1,0], resulting in [2,3,1,1,0], which is not sorted.

Alternatively, maybe splitting 10 first, but since 10 is after 1, and 1 < 10, maybe no operation can sort it.

So, in this case, the program would print "No", which is correct.

Wait, but according to the program, after splitting 23 into [2,3], it gets [2,3,1,10], which is not sorted, so it prints "No", which is correct.

So, seems correct for this case.

Let me think of another case.

Input:

4

[11, 1, 12, 2]

First, iterate from p=1 to p=3.

At p=1:

Check if list1[0]=11 > list1[1]=1 and 11 > 10: yes.

Split 11 into [1,1], so list becomes [1,1,1,12,2].

Now, check if sorted: 1 <=1 <=1 <=12 <=2? No, because 12 > 2.

So, it's not sorted.

At p=2:

Check if list1[1]=1 > list1[2]=1: no.

At p=3:

Check if list1[2]=1 < list1[3]=12: no.

At p=4:

Check if list1[3]=12 > list1[4]=2: yes, and 12 >10.

Split 12 into [1,2], so list becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2].

Now, check if sorted: 1 <=1 <=1 <=1 <=2 <=2, which is sorted.

So, it should print "Yes".

But according to the program, it only performs one operation per problematic pair.

Wait, in the loop, it iterates from p=1 to p=3 initially.

But after splitting 11, the list changes to [1,1,1,12,2], and p continues to p=2 and p=3 in the new list.

At p=2:

Check if list1[1]=1 > list1[2]=1: no.

At p=3:

Check if list1[2]=1 < list1[3]=12: no.

At p=4:

Check if list1[3]=12 > list1[4]=2: yes, and 12>10.

So, split 12 into [1,2], resulting in [1,1,1,1,2,2], which is sorted.

So, in this case, the program would correctly print "Yes".

Seems okay.

But is there a case where the program fails to perform operations multiple times and thus incorrectly concludes that the array cannot be sorted?

Let's consider:

Input:

3

[15, 5, 1]

First, p=1:

Check if list1[0]=15 > list1[1]=5 and 15>10: yes.

Split 15 into [1,5], so list becomes [1,5,5,1].

Now, p=2:

Check if list1[1]=5 > list1[2]=5: no.

p=3:

Check if list1[2]=5 > list1[3]=1: yes, and 5 <10, so cannot split.

So, the list is [1,5,5,1], which is not sorted.

But is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split 15 into [1,5], and then split another 5 (but 5 <10, cannot split).

So, seems like it cannot be sorted.

Hence, the program would print "No", which is correct.

Another case:

4

[100, 10, 1, 1]

First, p=1:

Check if 100 >10 and 100>10: yes.

Split 100 into [1,0,0], so list becomes [1,0,0,10,1,1].

Now, p=2:

Check if 0 >10: no.

p=3:

Check if 0 <10: no.

p=4:

Check if 10 >1: yes, and 10>10: yes.

Split 10 into [1,0], so list becomes [1,0,0,1,0,1,1].

Now, check if sorted: 1 <=0 <=0 <=1 <=0 <=1 <=1: No.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split all elements:

- Split 100 into [1,0,0]

- Split 10 into [1,0]

- So, the list becomes [1,0,0,1,0,1,1]

Which is not sorted.

Alternatively, split 10 first:

Original list: [100,10,1,1]

Split 10 into [1,0], so [100,1,0,1,1]

Now, p=1:

Check if 100 >1: yes, and 100>10: yes.

Split 100 into [1,0,0], so [1,0,0,1,0,1,1]

Which is not sorted.

Seems like no way to sort it.

Hence, the program would print "No", which is correct.

So far, the program seems to be working correctly for these cases.

But I need to think harder to find a case where the program fails.

Let's consider:

3

[10, 10, 1]

First, p=1:

Check if 10 >10: no.

p=2:

Check if 10 >1: yes, but 10>10: yes.

Split 10 into [1,0], so list becomes [10,1,0,1].

Now, p=2:

Check if 10 >1: yes, and 10>10: yes.

Split 10 into [1,0], so [1,0,1,0,1].

Now, check if sorted: 1 <=0 <=1 <=0 <=1: No.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split both 10s:

First split one 10 into [1,0], then the other 10 can be split into [1,0], resulting in [1,0,1,0,1], which is not sorted.

Alternatively, split the second 10 first:

Original list: [10,10,1]

Split second 10 into [1,0], resulting in [10,1,0,1].

Now, p=1:

Check if 10 >1: yes, and 10>10: yes.

Split 10 into [1,0], resulting in [1,0,1,0,1].

Still not sorted.

Hence, "No" is correct.

Seems okay.

Another case:

2

[10, 11]

p=1:

Check if 10 >11: no.

So, no operation performed.

List remains [10,11], which is sorted. So, "Yes".

Correct.

Another case:

3

[12, 13, 14]

p=1:

12 >13: no.

p=2:

13 >14: no.

Already sorted, so "Yes".

Correct.

Wait, but 12 <13 <14, so no operations needed.

Another case:

3

[12, 11, 13]

p=1:

12 >11: yes, and 12>10: yes.

Split 12 into [1,2], so list becomes [1,2,11,13].

Now, p=2:

2 >11: no.

p=3:

11 <13: no.

So, [1,2,11,13], which is sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

Another case:

4

[100, 10, 10, 1]

p=1:

100 >10: yes, and 100>10: yes.

Split 100 into [1,0,0], so list becomes [1,0,0,10,10,1].

p=2:

0 >10: no.

p=3:

0 <10: no.

p=4:

10 >1: yes, and 10>10: yes.

Split 10 into [1,0], so list becomes [1,0,0,1,0,10,1].

Now, check if sorted: 1 <=0 <=0 <=1 <=0 <=10 <=1: No.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split all 10s:

Original list: [100,10,10,1]

Split 100 into [1,0,0], so [1,0,0,10,10,1].

Split 10 into [1,0], so [1,0,0,1,0,10,1].

Split another 10 into [1,0], so [1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1].

Which is [1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1].

Still not sorted.

Seems like no way to sort it.

Hence, "No" is correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for these cases.

Wait, maybe I need to think of a case where multiple operations are needed to sort the array, but the program only performs one operation per pair.

Let's consider:

4

[20, 15, 10, 5]

Initially, list1 = [20,15,10,5]

p=1:

20 >15 and 20>10: split 20 into [2,0], so list becomes [2,0,15,10,5].

p=2:

0 <15: no.

p=3:

15 >10: yes, and 15>10: yes.

Split 15 into [1,5], so list becomes [2,0,1,5,10,5].

Now, p=4:

5 <10: no.

p=5:

10 >5: yes, and 10>10: yes.

Split 10 into [1,0], so list becomes [2,0,1,5,1,0,5].

Now, check if sorted: 2 <=0 <=1 <=5 <=1 <=0 <=5: No.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split all elements:

Original: [20,15,10,5]

Split 20 into [2,0]: [2,0,15,10,5]

Split 15 into [1,5]: [2,0,1,5,10,5]

Split 10 into [1,0]: [2,0,1,5,1,0,5]

Split 5 cannot be split.

Not sorted.

Alternatively, split 15 first:

Original: [20,15,10,5]

Split 15 into [1,5]: [20,1,5,10,5]

Now, p=1:

20 >1: yes, and 20>10: yes.

Split 20 into [2,0], so [2,0,1,5,10,5]

Same as before.

Seems like no way to sort it.

Hence, "No" is correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for this case.

Another case:

3

[11, 10, 12]

p=1:

11 >10 and 11>10: yes.

Split 11 into [1,1], so list becomes [1,1,10,12].

Now, p=2:

1 <10: no.

p=3:

10 <12: no.

So, [1,1,10,12], which is sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

Seems okay.

Wait, but what if we have overlapping splits?

Consider:

4

[11, 12, 13, 14]

p=1:

11 >12: no.

p=2:

12 >13: no.

p=3:

13 >14: no.

Already sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

Another case:

3

[12, 13, 11]

p=1:

12 >13: no.

p=2:

13 >11: yes, and 13>10: yes.

Split 13 into [1,3], so list becomes [12,1,3,11].

Now, p=2:

12 >1: yes, and 12>10: yes.

Split 12 into [1,2], so list becomes [1,2,1,3,11].

Now, p=2:

2 >1: yes, and 2<10: no operation.

So, list remains [1,2,1,3,11], which is not sorted.

Is there a way to sort it?

If we split 12 and 13:

Original: [12,13,11]

Split 12 into [1,2]: [1,2,13,11]

Split 13 into [1,3]: [1,2,1,3,11]

Still not sorted.

Alternatively, split 13 first:

Original: [12,13,11]

Split 13 into [1,3]: [12,1,3,11]

Now, p=1:

12 >1: yes, and 12>10: yes.

Split 12 into [1,2]: [1,2,1,3,11]

Same as before.

Not sorted.

Hence, "No" is correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for this case.

Wait, maybe I need to think of a case where splitting one element allows another element to be split in a way that sorts the array.

For example:

3

[10, 20, 15]

p=1:

10 >20: no.

p=2:

20 >15: yes, and 20>10: yes.

Split 20 into [2,0], so list becomes [10,2,0,15].

Now, p=2:

10 >2: yes, and 10>10: yes.

Split 10 into [1,0], so list becomes [1,0,2,0,15].

Now, check if sorted: 1 <=0 <=2 <=0 <=15: No.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split 20 first:

[10,2,0,15]

Then split 10 into [1,0]: [1,0,2,0,15]

Not sorted.

Alternatively, split 10 first:

Original: [10,20,15]

Split 10 into [1,0]: [1,0,20,15]

Now, p=1:

1 <0: no.

p=2:

0 <20: no.

p=3:

20 >15: yes, and 20>10: yes.

Split 20 into [2,0]: [1,0,2,0,15]

Still not sorted.

Hence, "No" is correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for this case.

Another case:

3

[11, 10, 12]

p=1:

11 >10 and 11>10: yes.

Split 11 into [1,1], so list becomes [1,1,10,12].

Now, p=2:

1 <10: no.

p=3:

10 <12: no.

So, [1,1,10,12], which is sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

Seems okay.

Wait, maybe I need to consider cases where elements are single digits.

For example:

3

[5, 10, 1]

p=1:

5 <10: no.

p=2:

10 >1: yes, and 10>10: yes.

Split 10 into [1,0], so list becomes [5,1,0,1].

Now, check if sorted: 5 <=1 <=0 <=1: No.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split 10 first:

[5,1,0,1], which is not sorted.

Alternatively, if we split 10 and then see if we can adjust.

Seems like no way to sort it.

Hence, "No" is correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for this case.

Another case:

2

[10, 1]

p=1:

10 >1: yes, and 10>10: yes.

Split 10 into [1,0], so list becomes [1,0,1].

Now, check if sorted: 1 <=0 <=1: No.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split 10 into [1,0]: [1,0,1]

Not sorted.

Hence, "No" is correct.

Seems okay.

Wait, but according to the program, it would split and see that it's not sorted, so "No".

Correct.

Another case:

2

[1, 10]

p=1:

1 <10: no.

Already sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

Seems okay.

Wait, but what if we have:

3

[1, 10, 2]

p=1:

1 <10: no.

p=2:

10 >2: yes, and 10>10: yes.

Split 10 into [1,0], so list becomes [1,1,0,2].

Now, check if sorted: 1 <=1 <=0 <=2: No.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split 10 first: [1,1,0,2], not sorted.

Hence, "No" is correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for this case.

Wait, but actually, if we split 10 into [1,0], we get [1,1,0,2], which is not sorted.

Is there another sequence of operations that could sort it?

If we split 10 first: [1,1,0,2], not sorted.

Alternatively, if we don't split 10 and accept that the array is not sorted, then "No".

Hence, "No" is correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for this case.

Another case:

3

[10, 10, 10]

p=1:

10 >10: no.

p=2:

10 >10: no.

Already sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

Seems okay.

Wait, but 10 ==10 is allowed in non-descending order.

Hence, "Yes" is correct.

Another case:

3

[10, 10, 11]

p=1:

10 >10: no.

p=2:

10 <11: no.

Sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

Seems okay.

Another case:

3

[10, 11, 10]

p=1:

10 <11: no.

p=2:

11 >10: yes, and 11>10: yes.

Split 11 into [1,1], so list becomes [10,1,1,10].

Now, check if sorted: 10 <=1 <=1 <=10: No.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split 11 first: [10,1,1,10], not sorted.

Hence, "No" is correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for this case.

Wait, but maybe if we split 10 instead.

Wait, but the program only splits elements that are greater than 10 and where the previous element is greater than the current one.

In this case, 11 >10 and 11>10: yes.

So, it splits 11 into [1,1], resulting in [10,1,1,10], which is not sorted.

Hence, "No" is correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for this case.

Another case:

4

[11, 12, 13, 14]

p=1:

11 <12: no.

p=2:

12 <13: no.

p=3:

13 <14: no.

Already sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

Seems okay.

Wait, but what if we have:

4

[11, 13, 12, 14]

p=1:

11 <13: no.

p=2:

13 >12: yes, and 13>10: yes.

Split 13 into [1,3], so list becomes [11,1,3,12,14].

Now, p=2:

11 >1: yes, and 11>10: yes.

Split 11 into [1,1], so list becomes [1,1,1,3,12,14].

Now, check if sorted: 1 <=1 <=1 <=3 <=12 <=14, which is sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for this case.

Wait, but according to the program, it would split 13 into [1,3], resulting in [11,1,3,12,14].

Then, p=2:

11 >1: yes, and 11>10: yes.

Split 11 into [1,1], so [1,1,1,3,12,14], which is sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

So, it handled multiple operations correctly in this case.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the program only performs one operation per pair, but in this case, it performed two operations: splitting 13 and then splitting 11.

Wait, no, in the loop, it iterates from p=1 to p=3 initially.

After splitting 13, the list changes, and p continues.

So, perhaps it's not rechecking the new elements introduced by splitting.

Wait, in the program, the loop runs from p=1 to p=len(list1)-1 initially, but when elements are inserted, the list changes.

But the loop doesn't reiterate over the new elements.

Wait, perhaps the program doesn't handle multiple operations correctly because it doesn't recheck the new array after splits.

Wait, in the program, the loop is fixed from p=1 to p=len(list1)-1 based on the initial list.

But when elements are inserted, the loop doesn't account for new splits that might be needed.

Wait, let's see.

In the earlier case:

Original: [11,13,12,14]

After splitting 13: [11,1,3,12,14]

Now, p=2:

Check if list1[1]=11 > list1[2]=1: yes, and 11>10: yes.

Split 11 into [1,1], so list becomes [1,1,1,3,12,14].

Now, p=3:

Check if list1[2]=1 < list1[3]=1: no.

p=4:

Check if list1[3]=1 < list1[4]=3: no.

p=5:

Check if list1[4]=3 < list1[5]=12: no.

Hence, it correctly sorts the array.

So, in this case, it performed two splits and ended up with a sorted array.

Hence, "Yes" is correct.

So, perhaps the program does handle multiple splits correctly, at least in this case.

Wait, but in general, since the loop iterates only once through the list, performing one split per problematic pair, it might not be enough if multiple splits are needed.

But in the previous case, it performed two splits and ended up with a sorted array.

Wait, no, in that case, it performed two splits: one for 13 and one for 11.

And after that, the array was sorted.

Hence, it worked correctly.

But what if more splits are needed?

Let's consider:

4

[100, 20, 15, 5]

p=1:

100 >20: yes, and 100>10: yes.

Split 100 into [1,0,0], so list becomes [1,0,0,20,15,5].

p=2:

0 <20: no.

p=3:

20 >15: yes, and 20>10: yes.

Split 20 into [2,0], so list becomes [1,0,0,2,0,15,5].

p=4:

0 <15: no.

p=5:

15 >5: yes, and 15>10: yes.

Split 15 into [1,5], so list becomes [1,0,0,2,0,1,5,5].

Now, check if sorted: 1 <=0 <=0 <=2 <=0 <=1 <=5 <=5: No.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split all elements:

Original: [100,20,15,5]

Split 100 into [1,0,0]: [1,0,0,20,15,5]

Split 20 into [2,0]: [1,0,0,2,0,15,5]

Split 15 into [1,5]: [1,0,0,2,0,1,5,5]

Which is not sorted.

Hence, "No" is correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for this case.

Another case:

3

[12, 13, 14]

p=1:

12 <13: no.

p=2:

13 <14: no.

Already sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

Seems okay.

Wait, but what if we have:

3

[12, 14, 13]

p=1:

12 <14: no.

p=2:

14 >13: yes, and 14>10: yes.

Split 14 into [1,4], so list becomes [12,1,4,13].

Now, p=2:

12 >1: yes, and 12>10: yes.

Split 12 into [1,2], so list becomes [1,2,1,4,13].

Now, check if sorted: 1 <=2 <=1 <=4 <=13: No.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split 14 first: [12,1,4,13]

Then split 12: [1,2,1,4,13]

Not sorted.

Hence, "No" is correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for this case.

Another case:

4

[11, 12, 13, 14]

p=1:

11 <12: no.

p=2:

12 <13: no.

p=3:

13 <14: no.

Already sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

Seems okay.

Wait, but what if we have:

4

[11, 13, 12, 14]

As before, it can be sorted by splitting 13 and 11.

Hence, "Yes".

Correct.

Seems okay.

Wait, maybe I need to think of a case where the program misses a possible sequence of operations that could sort the array.

For example:

3

[10, 10, 1]

p=1:

10 >10: no.

p=2:

10 >1: yes, and 10>10: yes.

Split 10 into [1,0], so list becomes [10,1,0,1].

Now, p=2:

10 >1: yes, and 10>10: yes.

Split 10 into [1,0], so list becomes [1,0,1,0,1].

Now, check if sorted: 1 <=0 <=1 <=0 <=1: No.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split both 10s: [1,0,1,0,1], not sorted.

Hence, "No" is correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for this case.

Another case:

3

[10, 11, 12]

p=1:

10 <11: no.

p=2:

11 <12: no.

Already sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

Seems okay.

Wait, but what if we have:

3

[10, 12, 11]

p=1:

10 <12: no.

p=2:

12 >11: yes, and 12>10: yes.

Split 12 into [1,2], so list becomes [10,1,2,11].

Now, p=2:

10 >1: yes, and 10>10: yes.

Split 10 into [1,0], so list becomes [1,0,1,2,11].

Now, check if sorted: 1 <=0 <=1 <=2 <=11: No.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split 12 first: [10,1,2,11]

Then split 10: [1,0,1,2,11]

Not sorted.

Hence, "No" is correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for this case.

Another case:

3

[11, 10, 12]

p=1:

11 >10: yes, and 11>10: yes.

Split 11 into [1,1], so list becomes [1,1,10,12].

Now, p=2:

1 <10: no.

p=3:

10 <12: no.

So, [1,1,10,12], which is sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

Seems okay.

Wait, but what if we have:

3

[11, 10, 13]

p=1:

11 >10: yes, and 11>10: yes.

Split 11 into [1,1], so list becomes [1,1,10,13].

Now, p=2:

1 <10: no.

p=3:

10 <13: no.

So, [1,1,10,13], which is sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

Another case:

4

[11, 12, 10, 13]

p=1:

11 <12: no.

p=2:

12 >10: yes, and 12>10: yes.

Split 12 into [1,2], so list becomes [11,1,2,10,13].

Now, p=2:

11 >1: yes, and 11>10: yes.

Split 11 into [1,1], so list becomes [1,1,1,2,10,13].

Now, check if sorted: 1 <=1 <=1 <=2 <=10 <=13, which is sorted. "Yes".

Correct.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for this case.

Wait, but in this case, it performed two splits: one for 12 and one for 11.

Hence, it handled multiple splits correctly.

So, perhaps the program is correctly handling multiple splits by performing them sequentially.

Hence, it might be correct.

But I need to think of a case where the program fails to sort the array even though it's possible.

Let me consider:

3

[10, 1, 10]

p=1:

10 >1: yes, and 10>10: yes.

Split 10 into [1,0], so list becomes [1,0,1,10].

Now, p=2:

1 >1: no.

p=3:

1 <10: no.

So, [1,0,1,10], which is not sorted.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split the other 10:

Original: [10,1,10]

Split first 10 into [1,0]: [1,0,1,10]

Split second 10 into [1,0]: [1,0,1,1,0], which is [1
