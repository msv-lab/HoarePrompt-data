Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to find an integer y (1 ≤ y < x) for a given integer x, such that the sum of y and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y is maximized. If there are multiple y's that satisfy this condition, any one of them can be chosen.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Given x, I need to find y such that y + GCD(x, y) is as large as possible, and y must be less than x.

Let's think about what y should be. Since y has to be less than x, the maximum y can be is x-1. Now, I need to check if y + GCD(x, y) is maximized when y is x-1.

Let's take an example. Suppose x = 10.

Possible y values are from 1 to 9.

Let's compute y + GCD(x, y) for each y:

- y=1: 1 + GCD(10,1)=1+1=2

- y=2: 2 + GCD(10,2)=2+2=4

- y=3: 3 + GCD(10,3)=3+1=4

- y=4: 4 + GCD(10,4)=4+2=6

- y=5: 5 + GCD(10,5)=5+5=10

- y=6: 6 + GCD(10,6)=6+2=8

- y=7: 7 + GCD(10,7)=7+1=8

- y=8: 8 + GCD(10,8)=8+2=10

- y=9: 9 + GCD(10,9)=9+1=10

From this, the maximum value is 10, achieved by y=5, y=8, and y=9.

Now, the program provided simply sets y = x - 1 for each x.

So for x=10, y=9, which gives y + GCD(x,y) = 9 + 1 = 10, which is indeed the maximum.

Let's try another example. x=7.

Possible y values: 1 to 6.

Compute y + GCD(7,y):

- y=1: 1 + 1 = 2

- y=2: 2 + 1 = 3

- y=3: 3 + 1 = 4

- y=4: 4 + 1 = 5

- y=5: 5 + 1 = 6

- y=6: 6 + 1 = 7

So, the maximum is 7, achieved by y=6.

The program would set y=6 for x=7, which is correct.

Another example: x=21.

Possible y values: 1 to 20.

Compute y + GCD(21,y):

- y=18: 18 + 3 = 21

- y=19: 19 + 1 = 20

- y=20: 20 + 1 = 21

So, y=18 and y=20 both give y + GCD(x,y) = 21.

The program would set y=20 for x=21, which is correct.

Another example: x=2.

Possible y values: 1.

y=1: 1 + 1 = 2.

Program sets y=1 for x=2, which is correct.

Now, is there any x where y=x-1 does not give the maximum y + GCD(x,y)?

Let me think about x=6.

Possible y values: 1 to 5.

Compute y + GCD(6,y):

- y=1: 1 + 1 = 2

- y=2: 2 + 2 = 4

- y=3: 3 + 3 = 6

- y=4: 4 + 2 = 6

- y=5: 5 + 1 = 6

Here, y=3, y=4, y=5 all give y + GCD(6,y) = 6.

The program sets y=5 for x=6, which is correct.

Wait, is there a case where y=x-1 is not among the y's that give the maximum y + GCD(x,y)?

Let's try x=4.

Possible y values: 1,2,3.

Compute y + GCD(4,y):

- y=1: 1 + 1 = 2

- y=2: 2 + 2 = 4

- y=3: 3 + 1 = 4

Here, y=2 and y=3 both give y + GCD(4,y) = 4.

The program sets y=3 for x=4, which is correct.

Another example: x=9.

Possible y values: 1 to 8.

Compute y + GCD(9,y):

- y=8: 8 + 1 = 9

- y=7: 7 + 1 = 8

- y=6: 6 + 3 = 9

- y=5: 5 + 1 = 6

- y=4: 4 + 1 = 5

- y=3: 3 + 3 = 6

- y=2: 2 + 1 = 3

- y=1: 1 + 1 = 2

Maximum is 9, achieved by y=6 and y=8.

The program sets y=8 for x=9, which is correct.

Wait, is there any x where y=x-1 does not give the maximum y + GCD(x,y)?

Let's try x=8.

Possible y values: 1 to 7.

Compute y + GCD(8,y):

- y=7: 7 + 1 = 8

- y=6: 6 + 2 = 8

- y=5: 5 + 1 = 6

- y=4: 4 + 4 = 8

- y=3: 3 + 1 = 4

- y=2: 2 + 2 = 4

- y=1: 1 + 1 = 2

Maximum is 8, achieved by y=4, y=6, y=7.

The program sets y=7 for x=8, which is correct.

Hmm, all these examples seem to work. Is there a case where y=x-1 doesn't give the maximum?

Let's try x=5.

Possible y values: 1,2,3,4.

Compute y + GCD(5,y):

- y=4: 4 + 1 = 5

- y=3: 3 + 1 = 4

- y=2: 2 + 1 = 3

- y=1: 1 + 1 = 2

Maximum is 5, achieved by y=4.

Program sets y=4 for x=5, which is correct.

Another example: x=12.

Possible y values: 1 to 11.

Compute y + GCD(12,y):

- y=11: 11 + 1 = 12

- y=10: 10 + 2 = 12

- y=9: 9 + 3 = 12

- y=8: 8 + 4 = 12

- y=7: 7 + 1 = 8

- y=6: 6 + 6 = 12

- y=5: 5 + 1 = 6

- y=4: 4 + 4 = 8

- y=3: 3 + 3 = 6

- y=2: 2 + 2 = 4

- y=1: 1 + 1 = 2

Maximum is 12, achieved by y=8,9,10,11,6.

Program sets y=11 for x=12, which is correct.

Wait, is there any x where y=x-1 is not giving the maximum sum?

Let's try x=1.

But according to the problem, x is at least 2, so x=1 is invalid.

Another example: x=100.

Possible y values: 1 to 99.

Compute y + GCD(100,y). The program sets y=99.

What is GCD(100,99)? It's 1.

So, y + GCD(100,y) = 99 + 1 = 100.

Is there a y where y + GCD(100,y) > 100?

Let's see y=50: GCD(100,50)=50, so 50 + 50 = 100.

y=75: GCD(100,75)=25, so 75 + 25 = 100.

y=25: GCD(100,25)=25, so 25 + 25 = 50.

y=20: GCD(100,20)=20, so 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the maximum is 100, achieved by y=50,75,99.

Thus, y=99 is correct.

Seems like y=x-1 is always giving the maximum sum, at least in these examples.

Wait, is there a mathematical reason why y=x-1 gives the maximum sum?

Let's think about it.

y + GCD(x,y)

We know that GCD(x,y) divides both x and y.

If y=x-1, then GCD(x,x-1)=1, because x and x-1 are consecutive integers, which are always coprime.

So, y + GCD(x,y) = (x-1) + 1 = x.

Is there any y where y + GCD(x,y) > x?

Let's see.

Suppose y < x.

Then, y + GCD(x,y) > x implies GCD(x,y) > x - y.

Is this possible?

Well, GCD(x,y) divides x and y, so it must divide x - y as well.

But x - y < x, since y > 0.

I'm not sure if this helps.

Let me consider y = x - d, where d is a positive integer less than x.

Then, y + GCD(x,y) = (x - d) + GCD(x, x - d).

But GCD(x, x - d) = GCD(x, d), since GCD(x, x - d) = GCD(x, d).

So, y + GCD(x,y) = (x - d) + GCD(x, d).

We need to maximize this expression.

Now, GCD(x, d) divides d, so (x - d) + GCD(x, d) ≤ x - d + d = x.

Wait, but in earlier examples, we saw that y + GCD(x,y) can be equal to x, but not greater than x.

Wait, in all the examples I've tried, the maximum sum is x.

In the case where y = x - 1, y + GCD(x,y) = (x - 1) + 1 = x.

In other cases, y + GCD(x,y) is less than or equal to x.

So, perhaps the maximum sum is always x, achieved when y = x - 1 or other y's where GCD(x,y) is appropriately valued.

But in all cases, y + GCD(x,y) ≤ x.

Wait, but in x=6, y=3 gives y + GCD(6,3)=3+3=6, which equals x.

y=4 gives y + GCD(6,4)=4+2=6, also equals x.

y=5 gives y + GCD(6,5)=5+1=6, again equals x.

Similarly for x=10, y=5 gives 5 + 5=10, y=8 gives 8 + 2=10, y=9 gives 9 +1=10.

So, in all these cases, the maximum sum is x.

Therefore, y = x - 1 gives y + GCD(x,y) = x - 1 + 1 = x.

And no y can give a sum greater than x, since y < x and GCD(x,y) ≤ d, where d divides x.

Hence, y = x - 1 is always a valid choice that achieves the maximum sum of x.

Therefore, the program is correct.

It always chooses y = x - 1, which guarantees that y + GCD(x,y) = x, which is the maximum possible sum.

Hence, Correctness: **True**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the sum of \( y \) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is maximized.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given an integer \( x \).
   - We need to find \( y \) such that \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \) is maximized, with \( y < x \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The sum \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \) reaches its maximum value when \( y = x - 1 \).
   - This is because \( \text{GCD}(x, x-1) = 1 \), and thus \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) = (x - 1) + 1 = x \).
   - In all tested cases, no \( y \) provides a sum greater than \( x \).

3. **Solution Code**:
   ```python
   def func():
       for _ in range(int(input())):
           x = int(input())
           y = x - 1
           print(y)
   ```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read from input.
   - For each test case, the integer \( x \) is read from input.

2. **Calculating \( y \)**:
   - For each \( x \), set \( y = x - 1 \).

3. **Output**:
   - Print the value of \( y \) for each test case.

This approach ensures that the sum \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \) is maximized for each \( x \), as \( y = x - 1 \) always achieves the sum equal to \( x \), which is the highest possible value given the constraints.
