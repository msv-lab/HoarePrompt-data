Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to generate a permutation of numbers from 1 to n such that there are no two distinct indices i and j (where 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j) where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. The program needs to do this for multiple test cases, each with a different value of n.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. A permutation of length n is just a rearrangement of the numbers from 1 to n. So, for n=4, possible permutations are [1,2,3,4], [4,1,2,3], [3,4,2,1], etc.

The condition to satisfy is that there should not exist any two different indices i and j such that both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. Divides means that p_j is a multiple of p_i, and similarly for p_{j+1} and p_{i+1}.

In the example given, for n=4:

- p = [4,1,2,3] is valid.

- p = [1,2,3,4] is invalid because i=1, j=3: 1 divides 3 and 2 divides 4.

- p = [3,4,2,1] is invalid because i=3, j=2: 2 divides 4 and 1 divides 2.

So, the program needs to output a permutation that avoids these invalid cases for each test case.

Looking at the provided program:

```python

def func():

    for i in range(int(input())):

        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]

        p = [0] * n

        ind = n

        for i in range(0, n, 2):

            p[i] = ind

            ind -= 2

        ind = 1 + n % 2

        for i in range(1, n, 2):

            p[i] = ind

            ind += 2

        print(*p)

```

This function reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n, creates a permutation p, and prints it.

Let's try to understand how the permutation p is constructed.

- It initializes p as a list of n zeros.

- It sets ind to n and fills the even indices (0-based) with decreasing even numbers from n downwards, stepping by 2.

- Then, it sets ind to 1 + n % 2, which is 1 if n is even, and 2 if n is odd, and fills the odd indices with increasing odd numbers starting from ind, stepping by 2.

So, for n=4:

- ind = 4

- p[0] = 4, ind -= 2 → ind=2

- p[2] = 2, ind -= 2 → ind=-0 (but since it's a for loop, it stops)

- ind = 1 + 4 % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1

- p[1] = 1, ind += 2 → ind=3

- p[3] = 3

So, p = [4,1,2,3], which matches the first example.

For n=3:

- ind = 3

- p[0] = 3, ind -= 2 → ind=1

- p[2] = 1

- ind = 1 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2

- p[1] = 2

So, p = [3,2,1], but according to the note, p=[1,2,3] is also valid, but the program outputs [3,2,1].

Wait, does [3,2,1] satisfy the condition?

Let's check for n=3:

Possible pairs (i,j) where 1 ≤ i,j < 3 and i ≠ j:

- i=1, j=2: check if p[1]=3 divides p[2]=2? 3 does not divide 2, so no problem.

- i=2, j=1: check if p[2]=2 divides p[1]=3? 2 does not divide 3.

Wait, but according to the problem, i and j are less than n, which is 3, so i and j can be 1 or 2.

Wait, indices start from 1 in the problem description, but in Python, lists are 0-indexed.

So, p[0] is p1, p[1] is p2, p[2] is p3.

So, for i=1, j=2:

- p1=3 divides p2=2? 3 does not divide 2.

- p2=2 divides p3=1? 2 does not divide 1.

For i=2, j=1:

- p2=2 divides p1=3? No.

- p3=1 divides p2=2? Yes, 1 divides 2, but since p2 does not divide p1, the condition requires both to be true, so it's fine.

Wait, but the problem says that there should not exist i and j such that both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

In this case, for i=2, j=1:

- p2=2 divides p1=3? No.

- p3=1 divides p2=2? Yes.

Since both are not true simultaneously, it's okay.

So, [3,2,1] seems valid.

But according to the note, all 6 permutations are valid for n=3, so it's fine.

Now, let's see for n=5:

- ind = 5

- p[0] = 5, ind=3

- p[2] = 3, ind=1

- p[4] = 1

- ind = 1 + 5 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2

- p[1] = 2, ind=4

- p[3] = 4

So, p = [5,2,3,4,1]

Is this valid?

Check for i=1, j=3:

- p1=5 divides p3=3? No.

- p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes.

But since p1 does not divide p3, the condition is not violated.

i=1, j=4:

- p1=5 divides p4=4? No.

- p2=2 divides p5=1? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=3:

- p2=2 divides p3=3? No.

- p3=3 divides p4=4? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=4:

- p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes.

- p3=3 divides p5=1? No.

No problem.

i=3, j=4:

- p3=3 divides p4=4? No.

- p4=4 divides p5=1? No.

No problem.

So, seems valid.

Another test case: n=6

- ind=6

- p[0]=6, ind=4

- p[2]=4, ind=2

- p[4]=2

- ind=1 + 6%2 = 1 + 0 =1

- p[1]=1, ind=3

- p[3]=3, ind=5

- p[5]=5

So, p=[6,1,4,3,2,5]

Is this valid?

Check i=1, j=3:

- p1=6 divides p3=4? No.

- p2=1 divides p4=3? Yes.

No problem.

i=1, j=4:

- p1=6 divides p4=3? Yes.

- p2=1 divides p5=2? Yes.

Ah, here both conditions are true: 6 divides 3? Wait, 6 does not divide 3, because 3 is not a multiple of 6. 3 is less than 6, so no.

Wait, in general, a divides b if b is a multiple of a.

So, 6 does not divide 3, because 3 is not a multiple of 6.

So, condition not violated.

i=1, j=5:

- p1=6 divides p5=2? No.

- p2=1 divides p6=5? Yes.

No problem.

i=2, j=3:

- p2=1 divides p3=4? Yes.

- p3=4 divides p4=3? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=4:

- p2=1 divides p4=3? Yes.

- p3=4 divides p5=2? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=5:

- p2=1 divides p5=2? Yes.

- p3=4 divides p6=5? No.

No problem.

i=3, j=4:

- p3=4 divides p4=3? No.

- p4=3 divides p5=2? No.

No problem.

i=3, j=5:

- p3=4 divides p5=2? No.

- p4=3 divides p6=5? No.

No problem.

i=4, j=5:

- p4=3 divides p5=2? No.

- p5=2 divides p6=5? No.

No problem.

So, seems valid.

Another test case: n=2

Wait, n=2 is not allowed since n >=3, as per the problem (n >=3).

Wait, in the problem statement, it says 3 <= n <=1e5.

So, n=2 is not allowed.

But in the program, it seems to handle n=2 as well.

Let's check for n=2:

- ind=2

- p[0]=2, ind=0

- p[2]=0 ? Wait, n=2, so only p[0] and p[1]

- ind=1 + 2%2 =1 +0=1

- p[1]=1

So, p=[2,1]

Is this valid?

According to the problem, for n=2, i and j can be 1, since 1 <=i,j <2, so i=1, j=1, but i ≠ j, so no pairs exist.

So, no pairs to check, so it's valid.

But n=2 is not allowed as per the problem, but the program handles it anyway.

So, seems fine.

Now, let's think about whether this program always generates a valid permutation.

Looking at the construction:

- It fills even indices (0-based) with numbers from n, decreasing by 2 each time.

- Then fills odd indices with numbers starting from 1 + n%2, increasing by 2 each time.

So, for even n:

- Even indices: n, n-2, n-4, ..., down to 2 or 3, depending on n.

- Odd indices: 1,3,5,... up to n-1 or n-2.

For odd n:

- Even indices: n, n-2, n-4, ..., down to 1.

- Odd indices: 2,4,6,... up to n-1.

Wait, for n=5:

- Even indices: 5,3,1

- Odd indices:2,4

So, p=[5,2,3,4,1]

Which we already checked and seems valid.

For n=4:

- Even indices:4,2

- Odd indices:1,3

p=[4,1,2,3]

Valid.

For n=3:

- Even indices:3,1

- Odd indices:2

p=[3,2,1]

Valid.

For n=6:

- Even indices:6,4,2

- Odd indices:1,3,5

p=[6,1,4,3,2,5]

Seems valid.

Now, is there any n where this construction fails?

Let's try n=7:

- Even indices:7,5,3,1

- Odd indices:2,4,6

p=[7,2,5,4,3,6,1]

Check for i=1, j=3:

- p1=7 divides p3=5? No.

- p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes.

No problem.

i=1, j=4:

- p1=7 divides p4=3? No.

- p2=2 divides p5=6? Yes.

No problem.

i=1, j=5:

- p1=7 divides p5=3? No.

- p2=2 divides p6=6? Yes.

No problem.

i=1, j=6:

- p1=7 divides p6=6? No.

- p2=2 divides p7=1? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=3:

- p2=2 divides p3=5? No.

- p3=5 divides p4=4? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=4:

- p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes.

- p3=5 divides p5=3? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=5:

- p2=2 divides p5=3? No.

- p3=5 divides p6=6? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=6:

- p2=2 divides p6=6? Yes.

- p3=5 divides p7=1? No.

No problem.

i=3, j=4:

- p3=5 divides p4=4? No.

- p4=4 divides p5=3? No.

No problem.

i=3, j=5:

- p3=5 divides p5=3? No.

- p4=4 divides p6=6? Yes.

No problem.

i=3, j=6:

- p3=5 divides p6=6? No.

- p4=4 divides p7=1? No.

No problem.

i=4, j=5:

- p4=4 divides p5=3? No.

- p5=3 divides p6=6? Yes.

No problem.

i=4, j=6:

- p4=4 divides p6=6? No.

- p5=3 divides p7=1? No.

No problem.

i=5, j=6:

- p5=3 divides p6=6? Yes.

- p6=6 divides p7=1? No.

No problem.

So, seems valid.

Is there any n where this fails?

Let me try n=8:

- Even indices:8,6,4,2

- Odd indices:1,3,5,7

p=[8,1,6,3,4,5,2,7]

Check i=1, j=3:

- p1=8 divides p3=6? No.

- p2=1 divides p4=3? Yes.

No problem.

i=1, j=4:

- p1=8 divides p4=4? Yes.

- p2=1 divides p5=5? No.

No problem.

i=1, j=5:

- p1=8 divides p5=4? Yes.

- p2=1 divides p6=5? No.

No problem.

i=1, j=6:

- p1=8 divides p6=2? No.

- p2=1 divides p7=7? Yes.

No problem.

i=1, j=7:

- p1=8 divides p7=2? No.

- p2=1 divides p8=7? Yes.

No problem.

i=2, j=3:

- p2=1 divides p3=6? Yes.

- p3=6 divides p4=3? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=4:

- p2=1 divides p4=3? Yes.

- p3=6 divides p5=4? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=5:

- p2=1 divides p5=4? Yes.

- p3=6 divides p6=5? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=6:

- p2=1 divides p6=2? Yes.

- p3=6 divides p7=7? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=7:

- p2=1 divides p7=2? Yes.

- p3=6 divides p8=7? No.

No problem.

i=3, j=4:

- p3=6 divides p4=3? Yes.

- p4=3 divides p5=4? No.

No problem.

i=3, j=5:

- p3=6 divides p5=4? No.

- p4=3 divides p6=5? No.

No problem.

i=3, j=6:

- p3=6 divides p6=2? No.

- p4=3 divides p7=7? No.

No problem.

i=3, j=7:

- p3=6 divides p7=2? No.

- p4=3 divides p8=7? No.

No problem.

i=4, j=5:

- p4=3 divides p5=4? No.

- p5=4 divides p6=5? No.

No problem.

i=4, j=6:

- p4=3 divides p6=2? No.

- p5=4 divides p7=7? No.

No problem.

- p4=3 divides p7=7? No.

- p5=4 divides p8=7? No.

No problem.

- p6=5 divides p8=7? No.

No problem.

i=6, j=7:

- p6=2 divides p7=7? No.

- p7=7 divides p8=7? Yes.

But p7=7 divides p8=7? Yes, but p6=2 divides p7=7? No.

So, both are not true simultaneously.

No problem.

So, seems valid.

Is there a pattern here?

It seems that the construction is avoiding having p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} simultaneously for any i and j.

How does this construction achieve that?

Let me try to understand the logic behind this construction.

The program arranges numbers in p such that even indices have numbers from n decreasing by 2, and odd indices have numbers from 1 increasing by 2.

So, for even n:

- Even indices: n, n-2, n-4, ..., down to 2 or 3.

- Odd indices: 1,3,5,... up to n-1 or n-2.

For odd n:

- Even indices: n, n-2, n-4, ..., down to 1.

- Odd indices:2,4,6,... up to n-1.

This seems to interleave high and low numbers in a specific pattern.

Is there a mathematical reason why this avoids the condition?

Let me think about divisibility.

In this arrangement, even indices have higher numbers decreasing, and odd indices have lower numbers increasing.

So, p_i divides p_j would require p_j to be a multiple of p_i.

Given the way numbers are arranged, it's less likely for p_i to divide p_j and p_{i+1} to divide p_{j+1} simultaneously.

But is it guaranteed?

Let's consider n=9:

- Even indices:9,7,5,3,1

- Odd indices:2,4,6,8

p=[9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1]

Check for i=1, j=3:

- p1=9 divides p3=7? No.

- p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes.

No problem.

i=1, j=4:

- p1=9 divides p4=5? No.

- p2=2 divides p5=6? Yes.

No problem.

i=1, j=5:

- p1=9 divides p5=5? No.

- p2=2 divides p6=6? Yes.

No problem.

i=1, j=6:

- p1=9 divides p6=3? No.

- p2=2 divides p7=8? Yes.

No problem.

i=1, j=7:

- p1=9 divides p7=3? No.

- p2=2 divides p8=8? Yes.

No problem.

i=1, j=8:

- p1=9 divides p8=1? No.

- p2=2 divides p9=1? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=3:

- p2=2 divides p3=7? No.

- p3=7 divides p4=4? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=4:

- p2=2 divides p4=5? No.

- p3=7 divides p5=6? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=5:

- p2=2 divides p5=5? No.

- p3=7 divides p6=6? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=6:

- p2=2 divides p6=3? No.

- p3=7 divides p7=3? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=7:

- p2=2 divides p7=3? No.

- p3=7 divides p8=8? No.

No problem.

i=2, j=8:

- p2=2 divides p8=1? No.

- p3=7 divides p9=1? No.

No problem.

i=3, j=4:

- p3=7 divides p4=5? No.

- p4=4 divides p5=6? Yes.

No problem.

i=3, j=5:

- p3=7 divides p5=5? No.

- p4=4 divides p6=6? Yes.

No problem.

i=3, j=6:

- p3=7 divides p6=3? No.

- p4=4 divides p7=3? No.

No problem.

i=3, j=7:

- p3=7 divides p7=3? No.

- p4=4 divides p8=8? Yes.

No problem.

i=3, j=8:

- p3=7 divides p8=1? No.

- p4=4 divides p9=1? No.

No problem.

i=4, j=5:

- p4=5 divides p5=5? Yes.

- p5=6 divides p6=6? Yes.

Ah, here both conditions are true: p4=5 divides p5=5, and p5=6 divides p6=6.

But according to the problem, this should not happen.

So, for i=4, j=5:

- p4=5 divides p5=5? Yes.

- p5=6 divides p6=6? Yes.

So, both conditions are true, which violates the problem's condition.

Therefore, the permutation p=[9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1] is invalid because there exists i=4 and j=5 where both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

Hence, the program is incorrect for n=9.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to generate a permutation of numbers from 1 to n such that there are no two distinct indices i and j (where 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j) where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. The provided program attempts to generate such a permutation but fails in certain cases.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to create a permutation p of length n where no two distinct indices i and j exist such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.
   
2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program constructs a permutation by placing numbers from n decreasing by 2 in even indices and numbers from 1 increasing by 2 in odd indices.
   - For example, for n=4: p = [4,1,2,3]
   - For n=9: p = [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1]

3. **Identifying the Flaw:**
   - The approach may not always avoid the condition where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.
   - For n=9, when i=4 and j=5: p4=5 divides p5=5 and p5=6 divides p6=6, which violates the condition.

### Solution Code
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that no such pair (i, j) exists in the permutation. One way to achieve this is by arranging the permutation in a way that minimizes the chances of p_i dividing p_j and p_{i+1} dividing p_{j+1}.

#### Corrected Approach
1. **Arrange the Permutation:**
   - Place the largest number at the beginning.
   - Alternate between placing the smallest and the next largest remaining numbers.

2. **Example:**
   - For n=4: p = [4,1,3,2]
   - For n=9: p = [9,1,8,2,7,3,6,4,5]

This arrangement reduces the likelihood of having p_i dividing p_j and p_{i+1} dividing p_{j+1} for any i and j.

#### Solution Code Implementation
```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        p = [0] * n
        high = n
        low = 1
        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                p[i] = high
                high -= 1
            else:
                p[i] = low
                low += 1
        print(' '.join(map(str, p)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read all input at once and split it into a list for easier access.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, read the value of n.
   - Initialize a list p of size n with zeros.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - Use two pointers: high starting from n and low starting from 1.
   - For even indices (0-based), assign the current high value and decrement high.
   - For odd indices, assign the current low value and increment low.

4. **Printing the Permutation:**
   - Print the permutation for each test case.

This approach ensures that high and low numbers are alternately placed, reducing the chances of having p_i dividing p_j and p_{i+1} dividing p_{j+1} simultaneously.
