Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to find an integer y (1 ≤ y < x) for a given integer x, such that the sum of y and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y is maximized. The program should output any y that satisfies this condition for each test case.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The goal is to maximize y + GCD(x, y), where y is less than x. The program provided simply sets y to x - 1 for each x. So, for x = 10, y = 9; for x = 7, y = 6; and so on.

I need to determine if this approach always yields a y that maximizes y + GCD(x, y). To do this, I should consider the properties of GCD and how they relate to the choice of y.

Let's think about what GCD(x, y) represents. It's the largest integer that divides both x and y without leaving a remainder. So, if y = x - 1, what is GCD(x, x - 1)?

I recall that GCD(x, x - 1) is always 1 because consecutive integers are coprime; they don't share any common divisors other than 1.

So, for y = x - 1, y + GCD(x, y) = (x - 1) + 1 = x.

Is this the maximum possible value for y + GCD(x, y)? Let's consider if there's any y where y + GCD(x, y) > x.

Suppose y = x - 2. Then GCD(x, x - 2) depends on x. For example, if x is even, x - 2 is also even, so GCD(x, x - 2) is at least 2.

So, y + GCD(x, y) = (x - 2) + GCD(x, x - 2).

If x is even, GCD(x, x - 2) is at least 2, so y + GCD(x, y) = (x - 2) + 2 = x.

If x is odd, x - 2 is odd, and GCD(x, x - 2) is at least 1, so y + GCD(x, y) = (x - 2) + 1 = x - 1.

In this case, for even x, y = x - 2 gives y + GCD(x, y) = x, which is the same as y = x - 1.

For odd x, y = x - 2 gives y + GCD(x, y) = x - 1, which is less than x.

So, for even x, choosing y = x - 2 also gives the same sum as y = x - 1.

For odd x, y = x - 1 is better than y = x - 2.

But is there a y that could give a higher sum than x?

Let's consider y = x - k for some k.

y + GCD(x, y) = x - k + GCD(x, x - k) = x - k + GCD(x, k).

We need to maximize this expression.

To maximize x - k + GCD(x, k), we need to minimize k and maximize GCD(x, k).

Wait, but k is positive since y < x.

So, to maximize y + GCD(x, y), we need to maximize y and maximize GCD(x, y).

Choosing y as large as possible, which is y = x - 1, seems like a good strategy, but we need to confirm if there's any y less than x - 1 that could give a higher sum.

Let's consider some examples.

Example 1:

x = 10

Possible y values:

y = 9: GCD(10, 9) = 1, sum = 10

y = 8: GCD(10, 8) = 2, sum = 10

y = 7: GCD(10, 7) = 1, sum = 8

y = 6: GCD(10, 6) = 2, sum = 8

y = 5: GCD(10, 5) = 5, sum = 10

y = 4: GCD(10, 4) = 2, sum = 6

y = 3: GCD(10, 3) = 1, sum = 4

y = 2: GCD(10, 2) = 2, sum = 4

y = 1: GCD(10, 1) = 1, sum = 2

So, the maximum sum is 10, achieved by y = 5, 8, 9.

The program chooses y = 9, which is acceptable.

Example 2:

x = 7

Possible y values:

y = 6: GCD(7, 6) = 1, sum = 7

y = 5: GCD(7, 5) = 1, sum = 6

y = 4: GCD(7, 4) = 1, sum = 5

y = 3: GCD(7, 3) = 1, sum = 4

y = 2: GCD(7, 2) = 1, sum = 3

y = 1: GCD(7, 1) = 1, sum = 2

Maximum sum is 7, achieved by y = 6.

The program chooses y = 6, which is correct.

Example 3:

x = 21

Possible y values:

y = 20: GCD(21, 20) = 1, sum = 21

y = 19: GCD(21, 19) = 1, sum = 20

y = 18: GCD(21, 18) = 3, sum = 21

y = 17: GCD(21, 17) = 1, sum = 18

y = 16: GCD(21, 16) = 1, sum = 17

y = 15: GCD(21, 15) = 3, sum = 18

y = 14: GCD(21, 14) = 7, sum = 21

y = 13: GCD(21, 13) = 1, sum = 14

y = 12: GCD(21, 12) = 3, sum = 15

y = 11: GCD(21, 11) = 1, sum = 12

y = 10: GCD(21, 10) = 1, sum = 11

y = 9: GCD(21, 9) = 3, sum = 12

y = 8: GCD(21, 8) = 1, sum = 9

y = 7: GCD(21, 7) = 7, sum = 14

y = 6: GCD(21, 6) = 3, sum = 9

y = 5: GCD(21, 5) = 1, sum = 6

y = 4: GCD(21, 4) = 1, sum = 5

y = 3: GCD(21, 3) = 3, sum = 6

y = 2: GCD(21, 2) = 1, sum = 3

y = 1: GCD(21, 1) = 1, sum = 2

Maximum sum is 21, achieved by y = 14, 18, 20.

The program chooses y = 20, which is correct.

Example 4:

x = 2

Possible y values:

y = 1: GCD(2, 1) = 1, sum = 2

Only y = 1 is possible, and sum is 2.

The program chooses y = 1, which is correct.

Example 5:

x = 6

Possible y values:

y = 5: GCD(6, 5) = 1, sum = 6

y = 4: GCD(6, 4) = 2, sum = 6

y = 3: GCD(6, 3) = 3, sum = 6

y = 2: GCD(6, 2) = 2, sum = 4

y = 1: GCD(6, 1) = 1, sum = 2

Maximum sum is 6, achieved by y = 3, 4, 5.

The program chooses y = 5, which is correct.

From these examples, it seems that choosing y = x - 1 always gives a sum of x, which in these cases is the maximum possible. But is this always the case?

Let me consider x = 4.

y = 3: GCD(4, 3) = 1, sum = 4

y = 2: GCD(4, 2) = 2, sum = 4

y = 1: GCD(4, 1) = 1, sum = 2

Again, maximum sum is 4, achieved by y = 2 and y = 3.

Program chooses y = 3, which is correct.

Another example: x = 9

y = 8: GCD(9, 8) = 1, sum = 9

y = 7: GCD(9, 7) = 1, sum = 8

y = 6: GCD(9, 6) = 3, sum = 9

y = 5: GCD(9, 5) = 1, sum = 6

y = 4: GCD(9, 4) = 1, sum = 5

y = 3: GCD(9, 3) = 3, sum = 6

y = 2: GCD(9, 2) = 1, sum = 3

y = 1: GCD(9, 1) = 1, sum = 2

Maximum sum is 9, achieved by y = 6 and y = 8.

Program chooses y = 8, which is correct.

Wait a minute, is there any x where choosing y = x - 1 does not give the maximum sum?

Let's think about x = 8.

y = 7: GCD(8, 7) = 1, sum = 8

y = 6: GCD(8, 6) = 2, sum = 8

y = 5: GCD(8, 5) = 1, sum = 6

y = 4: GCD(8, 4) = 4, sum = 8

y = 3: GCD(8, 3) = 1, sum = 4

y = 2: GCD(8, 2) = 2, sum = 4

y = 1: GCD(8, 1) = 1, sum = 2

Again, maximum sum is 8, achieved by y = 4, 6, 7.

Program chooses y = 7, which is correct.

Another example: x = 5

y = 4: GCD(5, 4) = 1, sum = 5

y = 3: GCD(5, 3) = 1, sum = 4

y = 2: GCD(5, 2) = 1, sum = 3

y = 1: GCD(5, 1) = 1, sum = 2

Maximum sum is 5, achieved by y = 4.

Program chooses y = 4, which is correct.

Hmm, all these examples suggest that y = x - 1 is a safe choice, even if there are other y values that give the same sum.

Is there any x where y = x - 1 does not give the maximum sum?

Let me consider x = 6, which I already did. y = 5 gives sum = 6, which is the maximum. So, it's correct.

Wait, what about x = 12?

y = 11: GCD(12, 11) = 1, sum = 12

y = 10: GCD(12, 10) = 2, sum = 12

y = 9: GCD(12, 9) = 3, sum = 12

y = 8: GCD(12, 8) = 4, sum = 12

y = 7: GCD(12, 7) = 1, sum = 8

y = 6: GCD(12, 6) = 6, sum = 12

y = 5: GCD(12, 5) = 1, sum = 6

y = 4: GCD(12, 4) = 4, sum = 8

y = 3: GCD(12, 3) = 3, sum = 6

y = 2: GCD(12, 2) = 2, sum = 4

y = 1: GCD(12, 1) = 1, sum = 2

Maximum sum is 12, achieved by y = 6, 8, 9, 10, 11.

Program chooses y = 11, which is correct.

Still, no counterexample.

Let me try x = 999.

y = 998: GCD(999, 998) = 1, sum = 999

y = 997: GCD(999, 997) = 1, sum = 998

y = 996: GCD(999, 996) = 3, sum = 999

...

I can see that y = 998 gives sum = 999, which is the maximum.

But let's check if there's any y less than 998 that gives a higher sum.

Given that GCD(999, y) will be a divisor of 999, and 999 = 3^3 * 37.

So, possible GCD values are 1, 3, 9, 27, 37, 111, 333, 999.

But y < x, so GCD < x.

Wait, no, GCD can be less than x, but y < x.

So, y + GCD(x, y) < 2x.

But x is fixed, so we are trying to maximize y + GCD(x, y).

Given that y < x, the maximum possible y is x - 1.

If GCD(x, x - 1) = 1, then y + GCD(x, y) = x - 1 + 1 = x.

But in some cases, y = x - k where k divides x, might give a higher sum.

Wait, let's consider x = 1000.

y = 999: GCD(1000, 999) = 1, sum = 1000

y = 998: GCD(1000, 998) = 2, sum = 1000

y = 997: GCD(1000, 997) = 1, sum = 998

y = 996: GCD(1000, 996) = 4, sum = 1000

...

Again, y = 999 gives sum = 1000.

Is there any y where y + GCD(x, y) > x?

Wait, but y < x, and GCD(x, y) ≤ x, but in practice, GCD(x, y) is a divisor of x.

So, y + GCD(x, y) < x + GCD(x, y) ≤ x + x = 2x.

But we are trying to maximize y + GCD(x, y), which is less than 2x.

However, in all the examples, the maximum sum seems to be x or less.

Wait, but in the earlier examples, for x = 10, y = 5 gives GCD(10, 5) = 5, sum = 10.

Similarly, for x = 7, y = 6 gives sum = 7.

So, the maximum sum seems to be x.

Is it possible to have y + GCD(x, y) > x?

Let's suppose y < x and GCD(x, y) divides x.

Then y + GCD(x, y) ≤ y + x.

But since y < x, y + x > x, but y + GCD(x, y) ≤ y + x.

However, GCD(x, y) ≤ x, so y + GCD(x, y) ≤ y + x < x + x = 2x.

But can it be greater than x?

Wait, for y < x, and GCD(x, y) ≤ x, y + GCD(x, y) can be greater than x if y is close enough to x and GCD is significant.

Wait, but in the earlier examples, y + GCD(x, y) equals x, not greater.

Wait, for x = 10, y = 5, GCD = 5, sum = 10.

y = 5 < 10, GCD = 5, sum = 10, which is equal to x.

Similarly, for y = 9, GCD = 1, sum = 10.

Wait, but 9 < 10, GCD = 1, sum = 10.

Wait, but 9 + 1 = 10, which is equal to x.

Wait, but can y + GCD(x, y) be greater than x?

Let me see: y < x, GCD(x, y) ≤ x.

So, y + GCD(x, y) < x + x = 2x.

But in practice, it seems that y + GCD(x, y) ≤ x.

Is this always true?

Let me consider x = 4.

y = 3: GCD = 1, sum = 4

y = 2: GCD = 2, sum = 4

y = 1: GCD = 1, sum = 2

All sums are ≤ x.

Another example: x = 6.

y = 5: GCD = 1, sum = 6

y = 4: GCD = 2, sum = 6

y = 3: GCD = 3, sum = 6

y = 2: GCD = 2, sum = 4

y = 1: GCD = 1, sum = 2

Again, sums are ≤ x.

So, perhaps the maximum sum is always x.

If that's the case, then choosing y = x - 1, which gives sum = x, is acceptable.

But to confirm, is there any x where y + GCD(x, y) > x?

Let me try x = 8.

y = 7: GCD = 1, sum = 8

y = 6: GCD = 2, sum = 8

y = 5: GCD = 1, sum = 6

y = 4: GCD = 4, sum = 8

y = 3: GCD = 1, sum = 4

y = 2: GCD = 2, sum = 4

y = 1: GCD = 1, sum = 2

Again, sums ≤ x.

Another example: x = 12.

y = 11: GCD = 1, sum = 12

y = 10: GCD = 2, sum = 12

y = 9: GCD = 3, sum = 12

y = 8: GCD = 4, sum = 12

y = 7: GCD = 1, sum = 8

y = 6: GCD = 6, sum = 12

y = 5: GCD = 1, sum = 6

y = 4: GCD = 4, sum = 8

y = 3: GCD = 3, sum = 6

y = 2: GCD = 2, sum = 4

y = 1: GCD = 1, sum = 2

Again, sums ≤ x.

It seems consistent that y + GCD(x, y) ≤ x.

Therefore, choosing y = x - 1, which gives y + GCD(x, y) = x - 1 + 1 = x, is a correct choice.

Are there cases where y + GCD(x, y) < x?

Yes, for example, in x = 10, y = 7: 7 + 1 = 8 < 10.

But the problem allows any y that satisfies the condition, and since y = x - 1 gives the maximum sum of x, it's acceptable.

Therefore, the program is correct in choosing y = x - 1 for each x.

Hence, the Correctness is **True**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) for a given integer \( x \) such that the sum of \( y \) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is maximized.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to maximize \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \).
   - The simplest choice is \( y = x - 1 \), because \( \text{GCD}(x, x-1) = 1 \), leading to \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) = (x - 1) + 1 = x \).

2. **Verification**:
   - For various values of \( x \), we observe that \( y = x - 1 \) gives \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) = x \).
   - We need to confirm if this is indeed the maximum possible sum.

3. **General Case Analysis**:
   - For any \( y < x \), \( y + \text{GCD}(x, y) \leq x \).
   - Hence, choosing \( y = x - 1 \) achieves this maximum sum.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    for i in range(t):
        x = int(data[i + 1])
        y = x - 1
        print(y)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - We read all input at once for efficiency.
   - The first integer is the number of test cases \( t \).
   - Each of the next \( t \) integers represents \( x \) for that test case.

2. **
