Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program meets all the requirements correctly for every potential case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". Partial correctness isn't accepted; it's all or nothing.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem description fully. Let's read it again:

You are given an integer array `a` of length `n`.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

- Take any element of the array `a`, which is at least 10, delete it, and instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in the order they appear in that element.

For example:

- If we apply this operation to the 3rd element of the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, then the array becomes `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.

- If we apply this operation to the 2nd element of the array `[2, 10]`, then the array becomes `[2, 1, 0]`.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted in non-descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times (possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to transform the array `a` in such a way that `a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ ak`, where `k` is the current length of the array `a`.

Input:

- The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases.

- Each test case consists of two lines:

- The first line contains a single integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50).

- The second line contains `n` integers `a1, a2, ..., an` (0 ≤ ai ≤ 99).

Output:

- For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make it sorted in non-decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print "NO".

- You can print each letter in any case. For example, "yes", "Yes", "YeS" will all be recognized as a positive answer.

Example:

Input:

3

4

12 3 45 67

3

12 28 5

2

0 0

Output:

YES

NO

YES

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67].

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```python

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

    n = int(input())

    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))

    for p in range(1, len(list1)):

        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:

            a = list1[p - 1]

            list1.pop(p - 1)

            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)

            list1.insert(p, a % 10)

    if func_1(list1):

        print('Yes')

    else:

        print('No')

def func_1(lst):

    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)

    return lst == sorted_lst

```

Alright, so this program is trying to solve the problem by iterating through the list and applying the operation described in the problem if certain conditions are met. Specifically, for each pair of consecutive elements, if the previous element is greater than the current one and the previous element is greater than 10, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them in place.

Then, it checks if the modified list is sorted in non-descending order using the function `func_1`, which simply checks if the list is equal to its sorted version.

Now, I need to verify if this program correctly determines whether it's possible to sort the array by performing the specified operations any number of times.

First, I should consider the examples provided in the problem description:

1. Input: 4 12 3 45 67

   - Original array: [12, 3, 45, 67]

   - Program's approach: Iterate through the list.

     - Check 12 > 3 and 12 > 10: True

       - Split 12 into 1 and 2: Array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]

     - Check 2 > 3: False

     - Check 3 > 45: False

     - Check 45 > 67: False

   - Final array: [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

   - Expected output: YES

   - Program's output: Yes

2. Input: 3 12 28 5

   - Original array: [12, 28, 5]

   - Program's approach:

     - Check 12 > 28: False

     - Check 28 > 5: True and 28 > 10: True

       - Split 28 into 2 and 8: Array becomes [12, 2, 8, 5]

     - Check 12 > 2: True and 12 > 10: True

       - Split 12 into 1 and 2: Array becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]

     - Check 2 > 2: False

     - Check 2 > 8: False

     - Check 8 > 5: True, but 8 < 10, so no split

   - Final array: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which is not sorted.

   - Expected output: NO

   - Program's output: No

3. Input: 2 0 0

   - Original array: [0, 0]

   - Already sorted.

   - Expected output: YES

   - Program's output: Yes

So, for these examples, the program seems to work correctly. However, I need to think about whether this approach is correct in general or if there are edge cases where it might fail.

Let me think about what the program is doing. It's iterating through the list once and applying the split operation only when the previous element is greater than the current one and the previous element is greater than 10. After potentially splitting some elements, it checks if the list is sorted.

But the problem allows performing the operation any number of times. The program, however, only performs the operation once, in a single pass through the list. Is this sufficient to determine if it's possible to sort the array?

Wait, no. The problem allows performing the operation any number of times, possibly zero. So, I need to check if, by performing the operation any number of times, I can achieve a sorted array.

The program, as it stands, only performs the operation once, where applicable, and then checks if the result is sorted. This might not be enough because in some cases, you might need to perform the operation multiple times to achieve a sorted array.

Let me think of an example where the program would fail because it doesn't perform the operation multiple times.

Consider the input:

n = 3

array = [21, 15, 13]

Let's see what the program does:

- Initial array: [21, 15, 13]

- Check 21 > 15 and 21 > 10: True

- Split 21 into 2 and 1: Array becomes [2, 1, 15, 13]

- Check 1 > 15: False

- Check 15 > 13: True, but 15 < 10 is False, so no split

- Final array: [2, 1, 15, 13], which is not sorted

- Program would output "No"

But wait, is it actually possible to sort this array by performing the operation multiple times?

Let's see:

- Original array: [21, 15, 13]

- Split 21: [2, 1, 15, 13]

- Split 15: [2, 1, 1, 5, 13]

- Split 13: [2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3]

- Now, the array is [2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3], which is not sorted.

But maybe there's another sequence of operations:

- Original array: [21, 15, 13]

- Split 15: [21, 1, 5, 13]

- Split 21: [2, 1, 1, 5, 13]

- Split 13: [2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3]

- Still not sorted.

Is there any way to sort this array?

Let's try another approach:

- Original array: [21, 15, 13]

- Split 21: [2, 1, 15, 13]

- Split 15: [2, 1, 1, 5, 13]

- Split 13: [2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3]

- Not sorted.

Alternatively:

- Original array: [21, 15, 13]

- Split 13: [21, 15, 1, 3]

- Split 15: [21, 1, 5, 1, 3]

- Split 21: [2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3]

- Still not sorted.

It seems like no matter how I split the numbers, I can't get a sorted array. So, in this case, the program correctly outputs "No".

Another example:

n = 4

array = [100, 10, 1]

- Initial array: [100, 10, 1]

- Split 100: [1, 0, 0, 10, 1]

- Check 1 > 0: True and 1 > 10: False → split 1

- Wait, but 1 is less than 10, so no split

- Final array: [1, 0, 0, 10, 1], which is not sorted

- Program would output "No"

But is it possible to sort this array?

- Original: [100, 10, 1]

- Split 100: [1, 0, 0, 10, 1]

- Split 10: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

- Now, the array is [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], which is not sorted.

- Is there another way?

- Split 10 instead of 100 first.

- Original: [100, 10, 1]

- Split 10: [100, 1, 0, 1]

- Split 100: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

- Still not sorted.

- It seems impossible to sort this array.

- So, the program would correctly output "No"

Wait, but according to the program, it only performs one pass of splits where applicable. But in this case, even after multiple splits, it's impossible to sort the array, so the program correctly identifies it.

Let's think of another example.

n = 3

array = [11, 11, 11]

- Initial array: [11, 11, 11]

- Split any 11: [1, 1, 11, 11]

- Split another 11: [1, 1, 1, 1, 11]

- Split the last 11: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

- Now, it's sorted.

- Program would split one 11: [1, 1, 11, 11]

- Check if sorted: No

- But actually, further splits can sort it.

- So, the program would output "No", but it's possible to sort it with multiple splits.

- Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

So, here's a counterexample where the program outputs "No", but it's actually possible to sort the array with multiple splits.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To summarize:

- The program only performs splits once, in a single pass, and then checks if the array is sorted.

- However, the problem allows performing the operation any number of times, so it's possible that multiple splits are needed to sort the array.

- The program doesn't account for multiple splits beyond a single pass, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Hence, the Correctness is **False**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to make an array sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly splitting numbers that are at least 10 into their individual digits.

### Approach
1. **Initial Understanding**: We need to check if the array can be sorted by splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their digits any number of times.
2. **Insight**: Each number can be split into its digits recursively until all elements are single digits. The sequence of digits should be in non-descending order for the array to be sorted.
3. **Plan**: 
    - For each test case, we will split all numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their digits.
    - We will then check if the resulting list of digits is sorted in non-descending order.

### Solution Code
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    # Split all numbers >= 10 into their digits
    digits = []
    for num in arr:
        if num >= 10:
            digits.extend([int(d) for d in str(num)])
        else:
            digits.append(num)
    # Check if the list of digits is sorted in non-descending order
    sorted_digits = sorted(digits)
    if digits == sorted_digits:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: 
    - Read the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, read `n` (number of elements) and the array `arr`.
2. **Splitting Numbers**:
    - For each number in the array, if it is greater than or equal to 10, split it into its individual digits and add these digits to a new list `digits`.
    - If the number is less than 10, add it directly to the `digits` list.
3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
    - Create a sorted version of the `digits` list.
    - Compare the `digits` list with its sorted version. If they are equal, print 'YES'; otherwise, print 'NO'.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine if the array can be sorted by splitting numbers into their digits, considering all possible splits recursively.
