Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to determine who wins a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins they have, and both play optimally. The program needs to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Alice and Bob have a certain number of coins each, and they take turns performing specific operations. In each turn, a player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who can't make a valid move loses.

The program provided is quite straightforward. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of a and b (the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively). It then checks if the sum of a and b is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

Now, I need to verify if this logic is correct. Does the sum of a and b being even or odd determine the winner when both play optimally? I need to think about the game mechanics and see if this simple condition captures the essence of the game.

Let me consider some small test cases to see if this makes sense.

Take the first example from the problem:

Input:

10

1 1

1 4

5 3

4 5

11 9

83 91

1032 9307

839204 7281

1000000000 1000000000

53110 2024

Output:

Bob

Alice

Bob

Alice

Bob

Bob

Alice

Alice

Bob

Bob

According to the program, for each test case, if a + b is even, Bob wins; else, Alice wins.

Let's take the first test case: a=1, b=1. Sum is 2, which is even, so Bob wins. According to the explanation in the problem, Bob wins in this case, so it matches.

Second test case: a=1, b=4. Sum is 5, which is odd, so Alice wins. The problem's example shows Alice wins, so it matches.

Third test case: a=5, b=3. Sum is 8, even, Bob wins. Matches the output.

Fourth: a=4, b=5. Sum 9, odd, Alice wins. Matches.

Fifth: a=11, b=9. Sum 20, even, Bob wins. Matches.

Sixth: a=83, b=91. Sum 174, even, Bob wins. Matches.

Seventh: a=1032, b=9307. Sum 1032 + 9307 = 1032 + 9000 = 10032 + 307 = 10339, which is odd, so Alice wins. According to the output, Alice wins. Matches.

Eighth: a=839204, b=7281. Sum 839204 + 7281 = 839204 + 7000 = 846204 + 281 = 846485, which is odd, so Alice wins. Output shows Alice wins. Matches.

Ninth: a=1000000000, b=1000000000. Sum 2000000000, even, Bob wins. Matches.

Tenth: a=53110, b=2024. Sum 53110 + 2024 = 53000 + 110 + 2000 + 24 = 55000 + 134 = 55134, which is even, so Bob wins. Matches the output.

So, all the given examples match the program's output. That's a good sign, but I need to ensure that this logic holds for all possible cases, not just these examples.

Let me think about the game mechanics more deeply. The game allows each player to either swap wallets or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The game continues until a player cannot make a move, which happens when both wallets are empty or when a player's wallet is empty and they choose not to swap.

I need to consider the game as a whole and see if the sum being even or odd determines the winner.

First, observe that the total number of coins is invariant; it doesn't change throughout the game because in each move, exactly one coin is removed.

The game ends when a player cannot make a move. That happens when a player's current wallet has zero coins, and they choose not to swap, but the opponent's wallet also has zero coins, so swapping wouldn't help.

Wait, actually, the rules say: "Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step."

So, a player must have at least one coin in their current wallet to make a move. If a player has zero coins in their current wallet, they lose.

Now, the player can choose to swap wallets before removing a coin. So, swapping allows a player to switch to the opponent's wallet and remove a coin from there.

Given that, the game is about managing the coins in such a way that you force your opponent into a position where their wallet is empty and they can't make a move.

I need to think about the game in terms of game theory, specifically impartial games, where the set of moves available depends only on the position and not on which player's turn it is.

However, in this game, the set of moves depends on the current wallets of both players, and the players can choose to swap or not swap, which makes it a bit more complex.

Let me try to model this game in terms of the number of coins each player has.

Let's denote the state of the game by (a, b), where a is the number of coins in Alice's wallet and b is the number in Bob's.

Each player, on their turn, can choose to swap or not swap, and then remove one coin from their current wallet.

If a player chooses not to swap, they remove one coin from their own wallet.

If they choose to swap, they exchange wallets with the opponent and then remove one coin from their new wallet (which was the opponent's wallet before the swap).

So, from state (a, b), if it's Alice's turn:

- If she chooses not to swap, she removes one coin from her wallet: new state is (a-1, b).

- If she chooses to swap, she exchanges wallets, so her wallet now has b coins, and she removes one coin from it: new state is (b-1, a).

Similarly, for Bob's turn, from state (a, b):

- If he chooses not to swap, he removes one coin from his wallet: (a, b-1).

- If he chooses to swap, he exchanges wallets and removes one coin from the new wallet: (b-1, a).

The game continues until a player cannot make a move, which happens when a or b is zero, and the player whose turn it is has no valid move.

I need to find out, for any given (a, b), who wins if both play optimally.

This seems like a classic impartial game that can be analyzed using the concept of Nimbers or mex function in game theory.

However, given the constraints (a and b can be up to 10^9), it's impractical to compute the game for all possible states. Instead, I need to find a mathematical pattern or formula that can determine the winner based on a and b.

Looking back at the program, it simply checks if a + b is even or odd.

Is this correct?

Let me consider some small values.

Case 1: a=1, b=1.

Sum is 2, even. According to the program, Bob wins.

Is this correct?

Let's simulate:

- Alice's turn: chooses to swap or not.

Option 1: not swap, remove 1 from a -> (0,1). Now Bob has to move from (0,1). He can choose to swap, becoming (1,0), then remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Now Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Option 2: swap, become (1,0), then remove 1 from b -> (1,0). Now Bob has to move from (1,0). He can choose to not swap, remove 1 from b -> (1,0) again. This seems stuck, but actually, Bob can choose to swap, becoming (0,1), then remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Again, Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

So, in both options, Bob wins. Correct.

Case 2: a=1, b=2.

Sum is 3, odd. Program says Alice wins.

Simulate:

- Alice's turn: choose to swap or not.

Option 1: not swap, remove 1 from a -> (0,2). Now Bob has to move from (0,2). He must choose to swap, becoming (2,0), then remove 1 from a -> (1,0). Now Alice moves from (1,0). She can choose to not swap, remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Option 2: swap, become (2,1), then remove 1 from a -> (1,1). Now Bob moves from (1,1). As in case 1, Bob can force a win, but according to this, it's Alice's turn, and she chose to swap, leading to (1,1). Wait, according to the program, Alice should win, so maybe there's a different strategy.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider the game in terms of the total number of coins.

If a + b is even, Bob wins; else, Alice wins.

Is there a pattern based on the parity of a + b?

Let me consider a few more cases.

Case 3: a=2, b=2. Sum 4, even. Program says Bob wins.

Simulate:

- Alice's turn: choose to swap or not.

Option 1: not swap, remove 1 from a -> (1,2). Bob's turn: choose to swap or not.

- If Bob chooses not to swap, remove 1 from b -> (1,1). Alice's turn: choose to swap, become (1,0), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Bob can't move, so Alice wins. Wait, but according to the program, Bob should win.

Hmm, contradiction here.

Wait, according to my simulation, Alice can force a win even when a + b is even.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Let's try again.

Alice's turn: (2,2)

Option 1: not swap, become (1,2)

Bob's turn: (1,2)

Option 1: not swap, become (1,1)

Alice's turn: (1,1)

Option 1: not swap, become (0,1)

Bob's turn: (0,1)

Must swap, become (1,0), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

Option 2: swap, become (1,0), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

So, in this case, depending on Bob's choice, Bob can force a win.

Wait, but in the first option, Bob chooses not to swap, leading to Alice winning. But if Bob chooses to swap, maybe there's a different outcome.

Wait, perhaps I need to think more deeply.

Let me consider that both players play optimally, meaning they make choices that lead to their victory if possible.

In the case where a + b is even, perhaps there's a strategy for Bob to always win.

But in the above simulation, it seems that Bob can choose actions that lead to either winning or losing, depending on his choice. So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that both players always make the best possible choice at each step to maximize their chance of winning.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for a general pattern or formula.

Let me consider the game in terms of the number of coins each player has and see if I can find a pattern.

I recall that in impartial games, the Grundy number or mex function can be used to determine the winner.

But given the constraints, computing Grundy numbers for large a and b is impractical.

Is there a way to find a formula based on a and b?

Let me consider the parity of a and b.

In the program, it only checks the parity of a + b.

But in the simulation above, when a + b is even, it's not always the case that Bob wins.

Wait, in the earlier simulation, when a=2 and b=2, a + b = 4 (even), and depending on the moves, Bob can win or lose.

But according to the program, it should always print "Bob" for even sums, but in this case, it's possible for Alice to win, as shown in the simulation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the problem's example, for a=1 and b=1, sum is even, and Bob wins. For a=1 and b=4, sum is odd, Alice wins, which matches.

But in a=2 and b=2, sum is even, but depending on the moves, Alice can win or lose.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider the total number of coins and see if that determines the winner.

The total number of coins is a + b.

Each move reduces the total number of coins by one.

The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when their current wallet is empty and they choose not to swap, but swapping wouldn't help if the opponent's wallet is also empty.

So, the game ends when both a and b are zero, or when a player's current wallet is zero and they can't swap to a non-zero wallet.

Wait, but if a player's current wallet is zero, they must choose not to swap, and then they lose because they can't remove a coin.

But swapping would only help if the opponent's wallet is non-zero.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the parity of a + b.

Let me consider that each move reduces the total by one, and the player who is forced to make a move when the total is zero loses.

But the total starts at a + b and decreases by one each turn.

But the players alternate turns, and the game doesn't necessarily end when the total reaches zero, but when a player can't make a valid move.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of moves possible.

But it's not that simple because the players can swap wallets, which affects who has which wallet at each turn.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps I need to look for a pattern in small values of a and b.

Let me make a table for small a and b, say from 1 to 5, and see who wins.

Compute for each (a, b):

- If a + b is even, Bob wins; else, Alice wins.

Compare this with what the actual winner should be.

Let's try a=1 to 3, b=1 to 3.

Compute for each (a, b):

- a + b even: Bob wins

- a + b odd: Alice wins

Now, simulate each case to see if this holds.

Case a=1, b=1: sum=2, even, Bob wins. As per earlier simulation, Bob wins. Correct.

Case a=1, b=2: sum=3, odd, Alice wins.

Simulate:

- Alice's turn: choose to swap or not.

Option 1: not swap, become (0,2). Bob must swap, become (2,0), remove 1 from a -> (1,0). Alice's turn: swap, become (0,1), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Option 2: swap, become (2,1), remove 1 from a -> (1,1). Bob's turn: choose to swap or not.

- Option 1: not swap, become (1,0). Alice's turn: swap, become (0,1), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

- Option 2: swap, become (0,1), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

So, Alice can force a win. Correct.

Case a=1, b=3: sum=4, even, Bob wins.

Simulate:

- Alice's turn: choose to swap or not.

Option 1: not swap, become (0,3). Bob must swap, become (3,0), remove 1 from a -> (2,0). Alice's turn: not swap, become (1,0). Bob's turn: not swap, become (0,0). Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

Option 2: swap, become (3,1), remove 1 from a -> (2,1). Bob's turn: choose to swap or not.

- Option 1: not swap, become (2,0). Alice's turn: swap, become (0,2), remove 1 from a -> (0,1). Bob's turn: swap, become (1,0), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

- Option 2: swap, become (1,2), remove 1 from a -> (0,2). Alice's turn: must swap, become (2,0), remove 1 from a -> (1,0). Bob's turn: not swap, become (0,0). Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

So, in both options, Bob wins. Correct.

Case a=2, b=2: sum=4, even, Bob wins.

Earlier simulation showed that Bob can win, but I think I made a mistake before. Let's simulate again.

- Alice's turn: choose to swap or not.

Option 1: not swap, become (1,2). Bob's turn: choose to swap or not.

- Option 1: not swap, become (1,1). Alice's turn: choose to swap, become (0,1), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

- Option 2: swap, become (1,0), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Option 2: swap, become (2,1), remove 1 from a -> (1,1). Bob's turn: choose to swap or not.

- Option 1: not swap, become (1,0). Alice's turn: swap, become (0,1), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

- Option 2: swap, become (0,1), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Wait, in all these options, Alice wins, which contradicts the program's assumption that Bob wins when a + b is even.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me try another simulation for a=2, b=2.

- Alice's turn: choose to swap.

Suppose Alice chooses to swap, becoming (2,1), then remove 1 from a -> (1,1).

Now, Bob's turn: choose to swap.

Bob chooses to swap, becoming (1,0), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

Alternatively, Bob chooses not to swap, becoming (1,0). Alice's turn: swap, becoming (0,1), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

So, depending on Bob's choice, Bob can force a win or Alice can win.

But if Bob plays optimally, he would choose to swap, leading to his victory.

Therefore, Bob can win when a + b is even.

But in the earlier simulation, it seems that Alice can also force a win, but if Bob plays optimally, he can prevent that.

Hence, perhaps the program is correct, and I made a mistake in simulating the game.

Let me consider another case: a=2, b=3. sum=5, odd. Program says Alice wins.

Simulate:

- Alice's turn: choose to swap or not.

Option 1: not swap, become (1,3). Bob's turn: choose to swap or not.

- Option 1: not swap, become (1,2). Alice's turn: choose to swap or not.

- Option 1: not swap, become (0,2). Bob must swap, become (2,0), remove 1 from a -> (1,0). Alice's turn: swap, become (0,1), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

- Option 2: swap, become (0,1), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Option 2: swap, become (3,1), remove 1 from a -> (2,1). Bob's turn: choose to swap or not.

- Option 1: not swap, become (2,0). Alice's turn: swap, become (0,2), remove 1 from a -> (0,1). Bob's turn: swap, become (1,0), remove 1 from a -> (0,0). Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

- Option 2: swap, become (1,2), remove 1 from a -> (0,2). Alice's turn: must swap, become (2,0), remove 1 from a -> (1,0). Bob's turn: not swap, become (0,0). Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

So, in this case, depending on the choices, Alice can win or Bob can win. But if both play optimally, perhaps Alice can force a win.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider the game as a subtraction game or an impartial game
