Alright, I've been assigned this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The goal is to determine whether the program meets the requirements as specified, and if it does, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". It's important to note that partial correctness isn't acceptable; the program must handle every potential case correctly to be considered true.

I've been provided with three examples to understand how this works. Let's look at them one by one.

**Example 1:**

- **Problem Description:** Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- **Program:**

  ```python

  def is_not_prime(n):

      if n < 2:

          return True

      for i in range(2, n):

          if n % i == 0:

              return True

      return False

  ```

- **Answer:** Correctness: **True**

This seems straightforward. The function checks if a number is not prime by returning True for numbers less than 2 and for numbers that have divisors other than 1 and themselves. It returns False otherwise. This aligns with the problem description.

**Example 2:**

- **Problem Description:** Write a Python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with the same characters.

- **Program:**

  ```python

  def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):

      count = 0

      for i in range(len(s)-1):

          for j in range(i, len(s)-1):

              if s[i] == s[j+1]:

                  count += 1

      return count

  ```

- **Answer:** Correctness: **False**

Upon reviewing this code, it seems like the function is trying to count substrings where the first and last characters are the same. However, the nested loops suggest that it's iterating over starting and ending indices to check if they match. But there might be an issue with the range in the loops. For instance, if the string is "abc", the outer loop runs for i from 0 to 1, and the inner loop from i to 1. This might not cover all possible substrings correctly. Perhaps it's missing single-character substrings or some multi-character ones. Hence, it's marked as False.

**Example 3:**

- **Problem Description:** Write a function to perform binary search of a number in a list.

- **Program:**

  ```python

  def binary_search(arr, target):

      left = 0

      right = len(arr) - 1

      while left < right:

          mid = (left + right) // 2

          if arr[mid] == target:

              return mid

          elif arr[mid] < target:

              left = mid

          else:

              right = mid - 1

      if arr[left] == target:

          return left

      return -1

  ```

- **Answer:** Correctness: **False**

Looking at this binary search implementation, there's a potential issue with the while loop condition and how the search space is halved. Specifically, when left < right, it might not cover all possible elements, especially in lists with two elements. Also, the way left and right are updated might lead to an infinite loop in certain cases. For example, if left is 0 and right is 1, mid becomes 0, and if arr[0] < target, left becomes 0 again, leading to no change in the search space. Hence, it's incorrect.

Now, moving on to my task:

**Problem Description:**

There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. Each pair has a friendship value f_i.

The teacher goes on k excursions, choosing a pair of children randomly, equiprobably, and independently each time. If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. Friendship values of non-friend pairs are 0 and never change.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). The answer should be expressed as p/q where p and q are coprime, and calculate p * q^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7).

**Input:**

- First line: number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 5e4)

- For each test case:

  - First line: n, m, k (2 <= n <= 1e5, 0 <= m <= min(1e5, n(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2e5)

  - Next m lines: a_i, b_i, f_i (a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, 1 <= f_i <= 1e9)

Constraints ensure that the sum of n and m over all test cases doesn't exceed 1e5, and the sum of k doesn't exceed 2e5.

**Output:**

For each test case, print one integer â€” the answer to the problem.

**Example:**

Input:

4

100 0 24

2 1 10

1 2 1

3 1 2

2 1 1

5 2 4

1 2 25

3 2 24

Output:

0

55

777777784

40000020

**Note:**

- First test case: No friends, so all friendship values are 0.

- Second test case: Only one friend pair (1,2) with initial f=1. Each choice increases f by 1, so sum is 1+2+...+10=55.

- Third test case: Answer is 7/9, which is 777777784 mod (1e9+7).

- Fourth test case: Some values leading to 40000020.

**Program to Verify:**

```python

def func():

    for i in range(int(input())):

        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

        M = 10 ** 9 + 7

        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)

        s = 0

        a = 0

        for i in range(m):

            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())

            a += f

        for i in range(k):

            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a

        print(s % M)

```

**Task:**

Determine if this program correctly solves the problem as described. If it does, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Additionally, provide an explanation for why it's correct or incorrect.

**Approach:**

To verify the correctness of the program, I need to ensure that it accurately computes the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k excursions, as per the problem's requirements. This involves understanding the problem's mathematical model and checking if the code implements the correct formula or algorithm.

**Steps to Verify:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**

   - There are n children, m friend pairs with initial friendship values f_i.

   - Teacher chooses k pairs randomly with replacement.

   - If a chosen pair is a friend pair, their f_i increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

   - Need to find the expected sum of f_i at the time of choice for each of the k excursions.

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**

   - Total possible pairs: nC2 = n*(n-1)/2.

   - Probability of choosing any specific pair: 1 / nC2.

   - For friend pairs: their f_i increases by 1 each time they are chosen.

   - For non-friend pairs: f_i remains 0.

   - Need to compute the expected sum of f_i over k choices.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**

   - For each excursion, the expected contribution to the sum is the sum over all possible pairs of the probability of choosing that pair multiplied by its f_i at that excursion.

   - Since pairs are chosen independently each time, need to model how f_i evolves over excursions.

4. **Program Analysis:**

   - The program reads t test cases.

   - For each test case, it reads n, m, k.

   - Computes M = 10**9 + 7.

   - Computes c = (n*(n-1)//1)^(-1) mod M.

   - Initializes s and a.

   - Reads m friend pairs and sums their initial f_i into a.

   - For each of the k excursions, adds c*i*c*m + c*a to s.

   - Prints s % M.

5. **Identify Potential Issues:**

   - The computation of c: n*(n-1)//1 is just n*(n-1), and its modular inverse is computed correctly.

   - The program seems to assume that for each excursion, the expected increase is c*i*c*m + c*a, which seems suspicious.

   - Need to verify if this formula accurately reflects the expected sum.

6. **Check with Example Cases:**

   - **First Test Case:**

     - n=100, m=0, k=24

     - No friend pairs, so all f_i=0.

     - Expected sum=0, which matches the output.

   - **Second Test Case:**

     - n=2, m=1, k=10

     - Only one friend pair with f=1.

     - Each choice increases f by 1 if chosen.

     - Sum=1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 55, which matches the output.

   - **Third Test Case:**

     - n=3, m=1, k=2

     - One friend pair with f=1.

     - Need to verify if the expected sum is 7/9, which is 777777784 mod 1e9+7.

   - **Fourth Test Case:**

     - n=5, m=2, k=4

     - Two friend pairs with f=25 and f=24.

     - Need to verify if the sum is 40000020.

7. **General Correctness:**

   - Need to ensure that the formula used in the program correctly computes the expected sum for any n, m, k, and any set of friend pairs with their f_i.

   - The current formula in the program seems simplistic and might not account for the dynamic increase in f_i for friend pairs over multiple excursions.

8. **Alternative Approach:**

   - Model the problem as a sum of expected values for each excursion.

   - For each excursion, the expected f_i is the sum over all friend pairs of the probability of choosing that pair multiplied by their expected f_i at that excursion.

   - Since f_i increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen in previous excursions, need to model this dependency.

   - This seems to require considering the number of times each friend pair has been chosen in previous excursions, which could be complex.

9. **Simpler Insight:**

   - Consider that for each friend pair, the expected increase in f_i for each excursion they are chosen.

   - However, this needs to account for the fact that multiple excursions can choose the same pair, increasing their f_i for subsequent excursions.

   - This interdependence makes the calculation non-trivial.

10. **Conclusion:**

    - The provided program's formula seems too simplistic to capture the dynamic nature of f_i increasing over excursions.

    - It's likely incorrect for general cases where m > 0 and k > 1.

    - However, it works correctly for the first and second test cases due to specific conditions (m=0 and m=1 with k=10).

    - To confirm, let's think of a simple counterexample.

**Counterexample:**

Consider n=3, m=1, k=2

- Friend pair: (1,2) with f=1

- Total pairs: 3 (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)

- Probability of choosing any pair: 1/3

- For the first excursion:

  - Expected f_i = (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*0 = 1/3

- For the second excursion:

  - If (1,2) is chosen again, f_i=2

  - Probability of choosing (1,2) again: 1/3

  - Expected f_i for (1,2): (1/3)*(2) + (2/3)*(1) = (2/3) + (2/3) = 4/3

  - Expected f_i for (1,3) and (2,3): 0

  - Total expected f_i for second excursion: (1/3)*(4/3) + (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*0 = 4/9

- Total expected sum: 1/3 + 4/9 = (3/9 + 4/9) = 7/9

- Which matches the third test case's note.

- But according to the program, it's computing s += c*i*c*m + c*a for each excursion, which seems different.

- Let's see what the program computes for this case:

  - n=3, m=1, k=2

  - c = pow(3*2//1, -1, 1e9+7) = pow(6, -1, 1e9+7) = 166666668 mod 1e9+7

  - a = 1 (sum of f_i for m=1)

  - For i=0: s += 166666668 *0*166666668*1 +166666668*1 = 166666668

  - For i=1: s +=166666668*1*166666668*1 +166666668*1 = 166666668^2 + 166666668

  - Compute 166666668^2 mod 1e9+7 = (166666668 * 166666668) % (1e9+7)

  - 166666668 * 166666668 = 27777779555555544, mod 1e9+7 = 777777784

  - So s = 166666668 + 777777784 + 166666668 = 1111111120 mod 1e9+7 = 1111111120 - 1000000007 = 111111113

  - But according to the note, it should be 7/9, which is 777777784 mod 1e9+7.

  - Hence, the program's output is incorrect for this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
