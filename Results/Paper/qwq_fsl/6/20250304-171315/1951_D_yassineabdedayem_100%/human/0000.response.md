Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to help Bob set up stalls with specific pricing so that Alice buys exactly k jewels with her n coins. The program needs to output "YES" if it's possible to set up at most 60 stalls with integer prices between 1 and 10^18 such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, and "NO" otherwise. If "YES", it should also specify the number of stalls and their prices.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order, buys as many jewels as possible with her remaining coins, and moves on to the next stall. The goal is to arrange the stalls and their prices so that she ends up buying exactly k jewels.

The program provided seems to handle this in a function that processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads n and k, and then decides whether it's possible to set up the stalls accordingly.

Looking at the program:

- It reads the number of test cases t.

- For each test case, it reads n and k.

- If n equals k, it sets up one stall with price 1, so Alice buys exactly k jewels.

- If n + 2 is greater than k * 2, it sets up two stalls: the first with price n - k + 1 and the second with price 1.

- Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

I need to verify if this logic covers all possible cases correctly.

Let's consider the first example from the problem description:

Input:

3

7 3

6 4

255 8

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

NO

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

In the program's logic:

For the first test case (7,3):

- n = 7, k = 3

- n + 2 = 9, k * 2 = 6

- 9 > 6, so it falls into the second condition and sets up two stalls with prices 7 - 3 + 1 = 5 and 1.

But in the sample output, it shows "YES" with 10 stalls: 2 through 11.

This discrepancy makes me question whether the program's logic aligns with the sample outputs.

Wait, perhaps the program's approach is different from the sample solution. The sample solution uses multiple stalls, while the program uses at most two stalls in the provided logic.

I need to check if the program's approach is valid or if it's missing some cases.

Let me think about the general approach to solve this problem.

One way is to set up stalls with decreasing prices, similar to the binary representation of n, to control how many jewels Alice buys at each stall.

However, the program seems to handle only two stalls in some cases and one stall in others.

Let me consider the first sample input again:

n = 7, k = 3

Program's output:

YES

2

5 1

Let's simulate Alice's buying process:

- At the first stall with price 5, she can buy 7 // 5 = 1 jewel, left with 7 - 5 = 2 coins.

- At the second stall with price 1, she can buy 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels bought: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k.

So in this case, the program's output is correct.

Now, the second sample input:

n = 6, k = 4

Program's output:

NO

Let's see why:

- n = 6, k = 4

- n + 2 = 8, k * 2 = 8

- 8 is not greater than 8, so it outputs "NO"

But is there a way to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins?

Let's try:

- Stall 1: price 2, Alice buys 6 // 2 = 3 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

- Stall 1: price 1, Alice buys 6 // 1 = 6 jewels, which is more than 4.

- Stall 1: price 3, Alice buys 6 // 3 = 2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, buys 0 additional jewels.

- Total: 2 jewels, which is less than 4.

- Stall 1: price 2, buys 3 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Stall 2: price 1, buys 0 jewels.

- Total: 3 jewels, still less than 4.

- Stall 1: price 1.5, but prices must be integers.

It seems difficult to get exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins using integer prices.

Wait, but the problem allows up to 60 stalls, not just two.

Let's try more stalls:

- Stall 1: price 3, buys 2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 2 jewels.

- Need two more stalls with price 1, but she has no coins left.

- Doesn't work.

Another approach:

- Stall 1: price 1, buys 6 jewels, which is more than 4.

- Not suitable.

- Stall 1: price 2, buys 3 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Still only 3 jewels.

- Stall 1: price 1.5, but prices must be integers.

Seems like it's impossible to get exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins using integer prices, even with multiple stalls.

So, the program correctly outputs "NO" for this case.

Third sample input:

n = 255, k = 8

Program's output:

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

Let's simulate:

- Stall 1: price 128, buys 255 // 128 = 1 jewel, left with 255 - 128 = 127 coins.

- Stall 2: price 64, buys 127 // 64 = 1 jewel, left with 127 - 64 = 63 coins.

- Stall 3: price 32, buys 63 // 32 = 1 jewel, left with 63 - 32 = 31 coins.

- Stall 4: price 16, buys 31 // 16 = 1 jewel, left with 31 - 16 = 15 coins.

- Stall 5: price 8, buys 15 // 8 = 1 jewel, left with 15 - 8 = 7 coins.

- Stall 6: price 4, buys 7 // 4 = 1 jewel, left with 7 - 4 = 3 coins.

- Stall 7: price 2, buys 3 // 2 = 1 jewel, left with 3 - 2 = 1 coin.

- Stall 8: price 1, buys 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8, which matches k.

So, the program's output is correct for this case as well.

Now, I need to verify if the program's logic is general enough to cover all possible cases.

Looking back at the program:

- If n == k, set up one stall with price 1. Alice will buy n coins / 1 = n jewels, which equals k. Correct.

- If n + 2 > k * 2, set up two stalls: first with price n - k + 1, second with price 1.

- Else, output "NO".

Wait, but in the first sample input, n = 7, k = 3:

- n + 2 = 9

- k * 2 = 6

- 9 > 6, so it sets up two stalls with prices 7 - 3 + 1 = 5 and 1.

- As simulated earlier, this works.

Another test:

n = 5, k = 2

- n + 2 = 7

- k * 2 = 4

- 7 > 4, so set up two stalls with prices 5 - 2 + 1 = 4 and 1.

- Stall 1: 5 // 4 = 1 jewel, left with 5 - 4 = 1 coin.

- Stall 2: 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 1 = 2 jewels. Correct.

Another test:

n = 10, k = 5

- n + 2 = 12

- k * 2 = 10

- 12 > 10, set up two stalls with prices 10 - 5 + 1 = 6 and 1.

- Stall 1: 10 // 6 = 1 jewel, left with 10 - 6 = 4 coins.

- Stall 2: 4 // 1 = 4 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 4 = 5 jewels. Correct.

Now, what if n = 4, k = 2

- n + 2 = 6

- k * 2 = 4

- 6 > 4, set up two stalls with prices 4 - 2 + 1 = 3 and 1.

- Stall 1: 4 // 3 = 1 jewel, left with 4 - 3 = 1 coin.

- Stall 2: 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 1 = 2 jewels. Correct.

Another test:

n = 1, k = 1

- n == k, set up one stall with price 1.

- Alice buys 1 // 1 = 1 jewel. Correct.

n = 1, k = 2

- n + 2 = 3

- k * 2 = 2

- 3 > 2, set up two stalls with prices 1 - 2 + 1 = 0, which is invalid.

Wait, prices must be at least 1.

But here, n - k + 1 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0, which is invalid.

But according to the program, it should set up two stalls with prices 0 and 1, which is not allowed.

This seems like a potential issue.

Wait, in the program:

p1 = n - k + 1

p2 = 1

But if p1 <= 0, which can happen when n - k + 1 <= 0, i.e., n < k - 1.

But in this case, n = 1, k = 2:

n < k - 1 => 1 < 2 - 1 => 1 < 1, which is false.

So, n + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 > 2 * 2 = 4? Wait, 3 > 4 is false, so it should output "NO".

Wait, but according to the condition:

if n + 2 > k * 2:

which is 3 > 4, which is false, so it should output "NO", which is correct.

So, in this case, it correctly outputs "NO".

Another test:

n = 3, k = 2

- n + 2 = 5

- k * 2 = 4

- 5 > 4, set up two stalls with prices 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 and 1.

- Stall 1: 3 // 2 = 1 jewel, left with 3 - 2 = 1 coin.

- Stall 2: 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 1 = 2 jewels. Correct.

Another test:

n = 2, k = 1

- n + 2 = 4

- k * 2 = 2

- 4 > 2, set up two stalls with prices 2 - 1 + 1 = 2 and 1.

- Stall 1: 2 // 2 = 1 jewel, left with 0 coins.

- Stall 2: 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1 jewel. Correct.

Seems fine.

Another test:

n = 5, k = 3

- n + 2 = 7

- k * 2 = 6

- 7 > 6, set up two stalls with prices 5 - 3 + 1 = 3 and 1.

- Stall 1: 5 // 3 = 1 jewel, left with 5 - 3 = 2 coins.

- Stall 2: 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 2 = 3 jewels. Correct.

Another test:

n = 10, k = 4

- n + 2 = 12

- k * 2 = 8

- 12 > 8, set up two stalls with prices 10 - 4 + 1 = 7 and 1.

- Stall 1: 10 // 7 = 1 jewel, left with 10 - 7 = 3 coins.

- Stall 2: 3 // 1 = 3 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 3 = 4 jewels. Correct.

Seems like the program's logic works for these cases.

But is there any case where n + 2 > k * 2, but setting up two stalls doesn't result in exactly k jewels?

Let me try to find such a case.

Suppose n = 4, k = 1

- n + 2 = 6

- k * 2 = 2

- 6 > 2, set up two stalls with prices 4 - 1 + 1 = 4 and 1.

- Stall 1: 4 // 4 = 1 jewel, left with 0 coins.

- Stall 2: 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1 jewel. Correct.

Another case:

n = 5, k = 1

- n + 2 = 7

- k * 2 = 2

- 7 > 2, set up two stalls with prices 5 - 1 + 1 = 5 and 1.

- Stall 1: 5 // 5 = 1 jewel, left with 0 coins.

- Stall 2: 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1 jewel. Correct.

Another case:

n = 6, k = 2

- n + 2 = 8

- k * 2 = 4

- 8 > 4, set up two stalls with prices 6 - 2 + 1 = 5 and 1.

- Stall 1: 6 // 5 = 1 jewel, left with 1 coin.

- Stall 2: 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 1 = 2 jewels. Correct.

Seems consistent.

Now, what if n = 1, k = 1

- n == k, set up one stall with price 1.

- Alice buys 1 // 1 = 1 jewel. Correct.

n = 2, k = 1

- n + 2 = 4

- k * 2 = 2

- 4 > 2, set up two stalls with prices 2 - 1 + 1 = 2 and 1.

- Stall 1: 2 // 2 = 1 jewel, left with 0 coins.

- Stall 2: 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1 jewel. Correct.

n = 3, k = 1

- n + 2 = 5

- k * 2 = 2

- 5 > 2, set up two stalls with prices 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 and 1.

- Stall 1: 3 // 3 = 1 jewel, left with 0 coins.

- Stall 2: 0 // 1 = 0 jewels.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1 jewel. Correct.

Seems like the program handles these cases correctly.

Now, what about cases where n + 2 <= k * 2? The program outputs "NO" in such cases.

Is there any case where n + 2 <= k * 2, but it's still possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly k jewels?

Let's try to find such a case.

Suppose n = 5, k = 3

- n + 2 = 7

- k * 2 = 6

- 7 > 6, which falls into the second condition, and the program sets up two stalls with prices 5 - 3 + 1 = 3 and 1, which works as shown earlier.

Another case: n = 4, k = 3

- n + 2 = 6

- k * 2 = 6

- 6 <= 6, so program outputs "NO"

But is it possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels with 4 coins?

Let's try:

- Stall 1: price 1, buys 4 // 1 = 4 jewels, which is more than 3.

- Stall 1: price 2, buys 4 // 2 = 2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 2 jewels, which is less than 3.

- Stall 1: price 1.333... but prices must be integers.

Seems like it's impossible to get exactly 3 jewels with 4 coins using integer prices.

Hence, the program correctly outputs "NO" in this case.

Another case: n = 3, k = 2

- n + 2 = 5

- k * 2 = 4

- 5 > 4, set up two stalls with prices 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 and 1.

- Stall 1: 3 // 2 = 1 jewel, left with 1 coin.

- Stall 2: 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 1 = 2 jewels. Correct.

Seems fine.

Wait, what if n = 2, k = 2

- n == k, set up one stall with price 1.

- Alice buys 2 // 1 = 2 jewels. Correct.

Another case: n = 1, k = 1

- n == k, set up one stall with price 1.

- Alice buys 1 // 1 = 1 jewel. Correct.

Seems consistent.

Now, what if n = 1, k = 2

- n + 2 = 3

- k * 2 = 4

- 3 > 4 is false, so output "NO"

Earlier, we saw that it's indeed impossible, so correct.

Another case: n = 2, k = 3

- n + 2 = 4

- k * 2 = 6

- 4 > 6 is false, so output "NO"

Is it possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy 3 jewels with 2 coins? Let's see:

- Stall 1: price 1, buys 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 2 jewels, which is less than 3.

- Stall 1: price 0.5, but prices must be integers.

- Stall 1: price 1, buys 2 jewels; Stall 2: price 1, buys 0 jewels.

- Total: 2 + 0 = 2 jewels.

Still less than 3.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Seems like the program's logic is sound.

But to be thorough, let's consider larger values.

n = 100, k = 50

- n + 2 = 102

- k * 2 = 100

- 102 > 100, set up two stalls with prices 100 - 50 + 1 = 51 and 1.

- Stall 1: 100 // 51 = 1 jewel, left with 100 - 51 = 49 coins.

- Stall 2: 49 // 1 = 49 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 49 = 50 jewels. Correct.

Another case: n = 100, k = 49

- n + 2 = 102

- k * 2 = 98

- 102 > 98, set up two stalls with prices 100 - 49 + 1 = 52 and 1.

- Stall 1: 100 // 52 = 1 jewel, left with 100 - 52 = 48 coins.

- Stall 2: 48 // 1 = 48 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 48 = 49 jewels. Correct.

Seems consistent.

What about n = 100, k = 51

- n + 2 = 102

- k * 2 = 102

- 102 > 102 is false, so output "NO"

Is it possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 51 jewels with 100 coins?

Let's try:

- Stall 1: price 1, buys 100 // 1 = 100 jewels, which is more than 51.

- Stall 1: price 2, buys 100 // 2 = 50 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 50 jewels, which is less than 51.

- Stall 1: price 1.96, but prices must be integers.

Seems like it's impossible to get exactly 51 jewels with 100 coins using integer prices.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Another test: n = 100, k = 52

- n + 2 = 102

- k * 2 = 104

- 102 > 104 is false, so output "NO"

Similarly, it's impossible to get exactly 52 jewels with 100 coins using integer prices.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

So far, all test cases I've considered are handled correctly by the program.

Is there any edge case where n + 2 > k * 2, but the program's setup doesn't result in exactly k jewels?

Let me think about n = 1, k = 1

- n == k, set up one stall with price 1.

- Total: 1 + 0 = 1 jewel. Correct.

n = 3, k = 2

- n + 2 = 8

- k * 2 = 6

- 8 > 6, set up two stalls with prices 6 - 3 + 1 = 4 and 1.

- Stall 2: 2 // 1 = 2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 2 = 3 jewels. Correct.

n = 7, k = 4

- n + 2 = 9

- k * 2 = 8

- 9 > 8, set up two stalls with prices 7 - 4 + 1 = 4 and 1.

- Stall 1: 7 // 4 = 1 jewel, left with 3 coins.

- Stall 2: 3 // 1 = 3 jewels, left with 0 coins.

- Total: 1 + 3 = 4 jewels. Correct.

Seems consistent.

- Alice buys 1 // 1 = 1 jewel. Correct.

n = 1, k = 2

- n + 2 = 3

- 7 > 8 is false, output "NO". Correct.

n = 5, k = 5

- n == k, set up one stall with price 1.

- Alice buys 5 // 1 = 5 jewels. Correct.

Seems like the program handles all these cases correctly.

Is there any case where n + 2 > k * 2, but the program's setup doesn't result in exactly k jewels?

I can't find such a case. It seems that setting up two stalls with prices p1 = n - k + 1 and p2 = 1 always results in Alice buying exactly k jewels when n + 2 > k * 2.

Let me try to understand why this works.

In the first stall, Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels, and then proceeds to the second stall with the remaining coins.

With p1 = n - k + 1, let's see how many jewels she buys at the first stall.

Let me denote q1 = floor(n / p1)

Then, remaining coins after first stall: n - q1 * p1

At the second stall with p2 = 1, she buys floor((n - q1 * p1) / 1) = n - q1 * p1 jewels.

Total jewels: q1 + (n - q1 * p1)

We need q1 + (n - q1 * p1) = k

Let's solve for q1:

q1 + n - q1 * p1 = k

n + q1 * (1 - p1) = k

q1 * (1 - p1) = k - n

q1 = (k - n) / (1 - p1)

But p1 = n - k + 1

Substitute p1:

q1 = (k - n) / (1 - (n - k + 1)) = (k - n) / (1 - n + k - 1) = (k - n) / (k - n) = 1

So q1 = 1

Then, remaining coins: n - 1 * p1 = n - (n - k + 1) = n - n + k - 1 = k - 1

At the second stall, she buys k - 1 jewels.

Total jewels: 1 + (k - 1) = k

Hence, it always works when n + 2 > k * 2.

Therefore, the program's logic is correct.

Now, the problem mentions that Bob can erect at most 60 stalls, but the program only uses up to two stalls in its solution.

Is there any case where two stalls are not sufficient, but more stalls are needed?

From the above analysis, it seems that two stalls are sufficient whenever n + 2 > k * 2.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to set up at most 60 stalls with specific pricing such that Alice buys exactly k jewels with her n coins. The solution involves a careful analysis of the relationship between n and k and setting up stalls accordingly.

### Approach

1. **Check if n equals k**:
   - If n equals k, set up one stall with price 1. Alice will buy exactly k jewels.
   
2. **Check if n + 2 > k * 2**:
   - If this condition holds, set up two stalls: the first with price p1 = n - k + 1 and the second with price p2 = 1.
   - This ensures that Alice buys exactly k jewels by controlling the number of jewels she can purchase at each stall.

3. **Otherwise, output "NO"**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is satisfied, it is impossible to set up the stalls to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

### Solution Code

```python
from sys import stdin

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if n == k:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(1)
        elif n + 2 > k * 2:
            print('YES')
            print(2)
            p1 = n - k + 1
            p2 = 1
            print(p1, p2)
        else:
            print('NO')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: Read the number of test cases, t.
- **Step 2**: For each test case, read the values of n and k.
- **Step 3**: If n equals k, output "YES" and set up one stall with price 1.
- **Step 4**: If n + 2 > k * 2, output "YES", set up two stalls with prices p1 = n - k + 1 and p2 = 1.
- **Step 5**: In all other cases, output "NO" as it is impossible to set up the stalls to meet the requirement.

This approach ensures that we are adhering to the constraints provided and efficiently determining the correctness of the setup for each test case.
