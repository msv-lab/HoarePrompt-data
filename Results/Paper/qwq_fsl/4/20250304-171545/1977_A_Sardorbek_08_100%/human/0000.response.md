Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether it's possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where each move is either adding one cube or removing one cube from the top of the tower.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Nikita starts with no cubes, and in each move, he can either add one cube to the top or remove one cube from the top. So, at each step, the height of the tower can either increase by one or decrease by one, provided there is at least one cube to remove.

The goal is to find out if, after exactly n moves, the tower has exactly m cubes. I need to consider all possible sequences of add and remove operations that lead to m cubes in n moves.

Let me think about the constraints:

- n and m are both integers between 1 and 100.

- There are multiple test cases, specified by t, which is up to 100.

Looking at the example:

Input:

3

3 3

2 4

5 3

Output:

Yes

No

Yes

Explanation:

- For n=3, m=3: Add, Add, Add → 3 cubes.

- For n=2, m=4: Not possible to have 4 cubes in 2 moves.

- For n=5, m=3: Some sequence of adds and removes resulting in 3 cubes.

I need to generalize this.

Let me consider the net effect of the moves. Each add operation increases the number of cubes by 1, and each remove operation decreases it by 1, but only if there is at least one cube to remove.

Let’s define:

- Let a be the number of add operations.

- Let r be the number of remove operations.

Then, a + r = n (total moves).

The final number of cubes is a - r, but with the constraint that you can't remove more cubes than are present.

This constraint makes it a bit tricky because the number of valid remove operations depends on the current number of cubes.

I need to find if there exists non-negative integers a and r such that:

a + r = n

and

a - r = m

with the condition that at no point does the number of cubes become negative during the sequence of operations.

From a + r = n and a - r = m, I can solve for a and r:

Adding the two equations: 2a = n + m ⇒ a = (n + m)/2

Subtracting the two equations: 2r = n - m ⇒ r = (n - m)/2

For a and r to be integers, (n + m) must be even, and (n - m) must be even.

Also, since a and r are non-negative, (n + m)/2 ≥ 0 and (n - m)/2 ≥ 0.

Moreover, the sequence must not attempt to remove a cube when there are none available, meaning that at every step, the number of cubes is non-negative.

I need to ensure that in any sequence of a adds and r removes, the number of cubes never goes negative.

This is similar to the problem of valid parentheses sequences, where adds are like opening parentheses and removes are like closing parentheses.

In such problems, the condition for a sequence to be valid is that the cumulative sum never drops below zero.

In this context, the cumulative sum is the number of cubes at any point.

So, to ensure the sequence is valid, the number of adds should always be at least the number of removes up to any point in the sequence.

But since we're only interested in whether such a sequence exists, and not in constructing it, we can use the conditions above.

Given that, the program provided is:

def func():

a = int(input())

for i in range(a):

(b, c) = map(int, input().split())

q = (b, c)

if b == c:

print('YES')

elif b < c:

print('NO')

elif b % 2 == c % 2:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

I need to verify if this program correctly determines whether it's possible to have m cubes after n moves for each test case.

Let's analyze the program's logic:

1. If b (n) equals c (m), print 'YES'.

2. Else if b is less than c, print 'NO'.

3. Else if b and c are both even or both odd, print 'Yes'.

4. Else, print 'No'.

I need to see if this logic aligns with the conditions I derived earlier.

First, if n = m, it's possible by adding m times and removing 0 times. So, 'YES' is correct.

Second, if n < c, it's impossible because you can't have more cubes than the number of moves you've made (since you start with 0 and can only add one per move). So, 'NO' is correct.

Third, if n > c, we need to check if a and r are integers and the sequence doesn't make the cube count negative.

From earlier:

a = (n + c)/2

r = (n - c)/2

Both a and r need to be non-negative integers.

Also, the sequence should not have more removes than adds at any point.

The program checks if b % 2 == c % 2, which is equivalent to checking if (n + m) is even, since if n and m are both even or both odd, their sum is even.

But wait, a = (n + m)/2 needs to be an integer, which requires that n + m is even.

Similarly, r = (n - m)/2 needs to be an integer, which requires that n - m is even.

So, the program is checking if n - m is even (since b % 2 == c % 2 means n and m have the same parity, hence n - m is even).

However, we also need to ensure that a and r are non-negative.

From a = (n + m)/2 ≥ 0 and r = (n - m)/2 ≥ 0.

Given that n and m are positive integers, a is always non-negative.

r = (n - m)/2 ≥ 0 implies n ≥ m, which is already covered in the second condition.

But, more importantly, we need to ensure that the sequence doesn't make the cube count negative at any point.

The program doesn't seem to account for this condition directly.

Is this condition automatically satisfied if a and r are integers and n ≥ m?

Not necessarily. For example, consider n=3, m=1.

a = (3+1)/2 = 2

r = (3-1)/2 = 1

Possible sequences:

Add, Add, Remove → 1 cube

Add, Remove, Add → 1 cube

Add, Remove, Remove → invalid, as the second remove would try to remove from 1 cube, leaving 0, and the third remove would be invalid.

Wait, but in this case, r=1, and a=2, and n=3, m=1.

But according to the program, since n=3 and m=1, and 3 % 2 != 1 % 2 (both are odd, so ==), it would print 'Yes', which is correct because a valid sequence exists.

But in the invalid sequence above, Add, Remove, Remove would try to remove when there's only one cube, which is allowed only once.

Wait, no, remove is only allowed if there is at least one cube.

So, sequence:

Add, Remove, Add → 1 cube

Add, Add, Remove → 1 cube

Remove is not allowed at the start because there are no cubes.

Wait, but in the sequence above, the first operation can't be remove because there are no cubes to remove.

So, the only valid sequences are:

Add, Add, Remove → 1 cube

Add, Remove, Add → 1 cube

Both result in 1 cube, so it's possible.

Another example from the initial test case:

n=2, m=4

According to the program, since n=2 < m=4, it prints 'NO', which is correct.

Another test case:

n=5, m=3

a = (5+3)/2 = 4

r = (5-3)/2 = 1

So, sequence with 4 adds and 1 remove.

Possible sequences:

Add, Add, Add, Add, Remove → 4-1=3

Add, Add, Add, Remove, Add → 3

Add, Add, Remove, Add, Add → 3

Add, Remove, Add, Add, Add → 3

Remove is only valid if there's at least one cube.

But, can remove be placed in any position as long as there are at least r removes?

Wait, but in this case, since a > r, it should be possible.

So, the program seems to be correctly identifying cases where (n + m) is even and n >= m.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, I saw that a and r need to be integers, which requires that n + m is even and n - m is even.

But n + m even and n - m even is equivalent to n and m having the same parity (both even or both odd).

So, the program is checking if n and m have the same parity and n >= m.

In the first condition, if n == m, it prints 'YES', which is correct.

In the second condition, if n < m, it prints 'NO', which is correct.

In the third condition, if n > m and n and m have the same parity, it prints 'Yes', which seems correct based on the earlier analysis.

In the fourth condition, otherwise, it prints 'No'.

But, is there any case where n > m, n and m have the same parity, but it's still not possible to have m cubes after n moves?

I can't think of such a case.

For example:

n=4, m=2

a = (4+2)/2 = 3

r = (4-2)/2 = 1

Possible sequences:

Add, Add, Add, Remove → 3-1=2

Add, Add, Remove, Add → 2

Add, Remove, Add, Add → 2

Remove is only valid if there's at least one cube.

Since a > r, and the sequence can be arranged so that removes don't occur when there are no cubes, it should be possible.

Another example:

n=1, m=1

a = (1+1)/2 = 1

r = (1-1)/2 = 0

Sequence: Add → 1 cube

Which matches m=1.

n=2, m=0

a = (2+0)/2 = 1

r = (2-0)/2 = 1

Sequence: Add, Remove → 0 cubes

Which is valid.

n=3, m=1

a = (3+1)/2 = 2

r = (3-1)/2 = 1

Sequence: Add, Add, Remove → 2-1=1

Or Add, Remove, Add → 1

Both are valid.

n=4, m=0

a = (4+0)/2 = 2

r = (4-0)/2 = 2

Sequence: Add, Add, Remove, Remove → 0

Which is valid.

n=4, m=2

a = (4+2)/2 = 3

r = (4-2)/2 = 1

Sequence: Add, Add, Add, Remove → 3-1=2

Valid.

n=5, m=1

a = (5+1)/2 = 3

r = (5-1)/2 = 2

Sequence: Add, Add, Add, Remove, Remove → 3-2=1

Valid.

n=5, m=3

a = (5+3)/2 = 4

r = (5-3)/2 = 1

Sequence: Add, Add, Add, Add, Remove → 4-1=3

Valid.

n=6, m=4

a = (6+4)/2 = 5

r = (6-4)/2 = 1

Sequence: Add, Add, Add, Add, Add, Remove → 5-1=4

Valid.

It seems consistent.

Is there any case where n and m have the same parity, n >= m, but it's impossible to have m cubes after n moves?

I can't think of such a case.

Hence, the program's logic seems correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
