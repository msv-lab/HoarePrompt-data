Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. The goal is to determine whether the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. If it does, I need to print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that partial correctness isn't acceptable; the program must handle every potential case correctly to be considered correct.

I've been provided with some examples to understand how this works. In Example 1, the problem is to identify non-prime numbers, and the provided program seems to do that correctly, so the correctness is True. In Example 2, the task is to count substrings that start and end with the same character, but the program provided has some issues, so correctness is False. Similarly, in Example 3, the binary search function has a flaw, leading to correctness being False.

Now, for my actual task, the problem involves maximizing the sum of elements in an n x n matrix through a series of operations. The operations allow modifying rows or columns by assigning them permutations of numbers from 1 to n. The program needs to output the maximum possible sum and a sequence of operations to achieve this sum, with the number of operations not exceeding 2n.

Looking at the program provided:

```python
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

I need to verify if this program correctly maximizes the sum of the matrix elements as per the problem's requirements.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. We have an n x n matrix initialized to zeros. We can perform two types of operations:

1. Type 1: Choose a row i and a permutation p of [1, 2, ..., n], and set the elements of row i to p.

2. Type 2: Choose a column i and a permutation p of [1, 2, ..., n], and set the elements of column i to p.

Each operation overwrites the entire row or column with the chosen permutation. The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using at most 2n operations.

The program provided calculates the maximum sum using the formula n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6 and then performs 2n operations: first, applying type 1 operations to all rows, and then type 2 operations to all columns, each time using the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1].

I need to verify two main things:

1. Whether the calculated sum is indeed the maximum possible.

2. Whether the sequence of operations provided achieves this sum.

Let's start by verifying the formula for the maximum sum.

### Verifying the Maximum Sum Formula

The sum formula given is:

\[
s = \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1)}{6}
\]

I need to confirm if this is the correct maximum sum.

First, consider that each operation (either row or column) can set a row or column to a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n]. The sum of a permutation is always the sum of the first n natural numbers:

\[
\text{sum of one permutation} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
\]

If we perform operations to set all rows and all columns, we need to account for the overlaps where rows and columns are set.

However, since operations overwrite entire rows or columns, there can be conflicts where a cell is set multiple times. Specifically, if both a row and a column are set, the final value in the cell will be determined by the last operation applied to that row or column.

To maximize the sum, we need a strategy that ensures the highest possible values in as many cells as possible.

Let's consider the effect of performing operations on rows and columns.

### Strategy Analysis

The program performs:

1. Type 1 operations on all rows (n operations), each setting a row to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

2. Type 2 operations on all columns (n operations), each setting a column to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

So, in total, 2n operations.

Now, let's see what the matrix looks like after these operations.

Initially, the matrix is all zeros.

1. After applying type 1 operations to all rows, each row is set to [n, n-1, ..., 1]. So, the matrix is now:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n & n-1 & \cdots & 1 \\
n & n-1 & \cdots & 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
n & n-1 & \cdots & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

2. Then, applying type 2 operations to all columns, each column is set to [n, n-1, ..., 1]. So, for each column j (1 to n), set a_{1,j}, a_{2,j}, ..., a_{n,j} to n, n-1, ..., 1 respectively.

This means that after setting all columns, the matrix becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n & n & \cdots & n \\
n-1 & n-1 & \cdots & n-1 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's think again.

Actually, when applying a type 2 operation to a column, we set each element in that column to the corresponding value in the permutation. So, for column j, we set a_{1,j} = p_1, a_{2,j} = p_2, ..., a_{n,j} = p_n.

Given that we use p = [n, n-1, ..., 1] for each column, after applying type 2 operations to all columns, the matrix becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n & n & \cdots & n \\
n-1 & n-1 & \cdots & n-1 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Now, the sum of this matrix is:

\[
s = n \times (n + (n-1) + \cdots + 1) = n \times \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2 (n + 1)}{2}
\]

But according to the program, the sum is:

\[
s = \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1)}{6}
\]

These two expressions are different. So, there's a discrepancy here.

Let me check if my calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted how the operations affect the matrix.

Let me think differently.

Each type 1 operation sets a entire row to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Each type 2 operation sets a entire column to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

But operations are performed in sequence, and later operations can overwrite previous ones.

Specifically, if a row is set and then a column is set, the cells in that column will be overwritten by the column operation.

So, in the program's approach, first all rows are set, and then all columns are set.

Therefore, the column operations will overwrite the rows.

Hence, after all operations, the matrix will have each column set to [n, n-1, ..., 1], as the column operations overwrite the row operations.

Therefore, the matrix will be:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n & n & \cdots & n \\
n-1 & n-1 & \cdots & n-1 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

And the sum is:

\[
s = n \times (n + (n-1) + \cdots + 1) = n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2 (n + 1)}{2}
\]

But according to the program, the sum is:

\[
s = \frac{n (n + 1) (4n - 1)}{6}
\]

These two are not equal. So, either the program's sum calculation is wrong, or my understanding is incorrect.

Let me check for n=1:

n=1:

- According to my calculation: s = 1^2 * (1 + 1) / 2 = 1 * 2 / 2 = 1

- According to program: s = 1*2*(4*1 -1)/6 = 2*3/6 = 1

Matching for n=1.

For n=2:

- My calculation: s = 4 * 3 / 2 = 6

- Program: s = 2*3*(8-1)/6 = 6*7/6 = 7

But according to the example in the problem description, for n=2, the sum is 7, and the operations match that.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, the sum should be 6 for n=2, but the example shows sum=7.

So, perhaps my reasoning is flawed.

Let me check the example more carefully.

In the example for n=2:

Operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1: set row 1 to [2,1]

2. Type 1 on row 2: set row 2 to [2,1]

3. Type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [2,1]

So, after operation 1: matrix = [2,1; 2,1]

After operation 2: matrix = [2,1; 2,1]

After operation 3: set column 1 to [2,1], so matrix becomes [2,1; 2,1]

Wait, but in the problem description, it shows:

Operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1: set row 1 to [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2: set row 2 to [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [1,2]

After operation 1: matrix = [1,2; 0,0]

After operation 2: matrix = [1,2; 1,2]

After operation 3: set column 1 to [1,2], so matrix becomes [1,2; 2,2]

Sum = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7

Ah, I see. In my earlier reasoning, I assumed that all row operations are performed first, and then all column operations, with column operations overwriting row operations.

But in reality, the operations are performed in sequence, and the order matters.

So, in the example, operations are:

1. Type 1 on row 1: set row 1 to [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2: set row 2 to [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [1,2]

After operation 1: matrix = [1,2; 0,0]

After operation 2: matrix = [1,2; 1,2]

After operation 3: set column 1 to [1,2], so matrix becomes [1,2; 2,2]

Hence, sum = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7

But according to my earlier assumption, if we perform all row operations first and then all column operations, the sum would be 6 for n=2, but the example achieves 7.

So, perhaps performing operations in a specific order can lead to a higher sum.

This suggests that my initial approach of setting all rows first and then all columns might not be optimal.

I need to find a better strategy to maximize the sum.

### Optimal Strategy

To maximize the sum, we need to maximize the values in each cell of the matrix.

Each cell can be set to any value between 1 and n, but operations overwrite entire rows or columns.

The key is to maximize the number of high-value elements in the matrix.

One way to do this is to prioritize setting columns, as columns affect multiple rows.

However, the example suggests that a combination of row and column operations can achieve a higher sum than setting all rows and then all columns.

Let me try to find a general formula for the maximum sum.

### Calculating the Maximum Sum

Consider that each operation (row or column) sets the entire row or column to a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

The sum contributed by a row operation is the sum of the permutation, which is n(n+1)/2.

Similarly, for a column operation.

However, when both row and column operations are performed, there are overlaps where cells are set multiple times.

To maximize the sum, we need to maximize the number of times higher values are written to the matrix.

An optimal strategy might be to perform operations in such a way that the highest values are written last, so they are not overwritten by lower values in subsequent operations.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider the example for n=2 again.

Operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1: set row 1 to [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2: set row 2 to [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [1,2]

Resulting matrix:

- Row 1: [1,2]

- Row 2: [2,2]

Sum: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7

Alternatively, if we perform operations in a different order:

1. Type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [2,1]

2. Type 1 on row 1: set row 1 to [2,1]

3. Type 1 on row 2: set row 2 to [2,1]

Resulting matrix:

- After operation 1: [0,0; 0,0] -> [2,0; 1,0]

- After operation 2: [2,1; 1,0]

- After operation 3: [2,1; 2,1]

Sum: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6

Wait, this gives a lower sum.

So, the order of operations matters.

The initial approach in the problem's example achieves a higher sum.

### General Approach

To maximize the sum, we should aim to set columns last, so that the highest values in the columns overwrite the rows' values in those columns.

Wait, in the example, setting row 1 and row 2 first, and then setting column 1 last, allows the column operation to set higher values in the cells of column 1.

This seems promising.

Let me generalize this.

Suppose we perform type 1 operations on all rows, setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then perform type 2 operations on all columns, also setting them to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

In this case, the column operations will overwrite the rows' values for that column.

So, for each column, the values will be set to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and the rows' operations will be overwritten for that column.

But, in terms of sum, this might not be optimal.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each operation sets a row or column to a permutation, and the last operation that sets a particular cell determines its value.

So, to maximize the sum, I should aim to have as many high-value assignments as possible, especially in cells that are set by operations that assign higher values.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to compute the maximum possible sum.

### Maximum Possible Sum

Each cell in the matrix can be set to any value between 1 and n, but subject to the operations performed.

The key is to maximize the number of cells set to n, then to n-1, and so on.

However, due to the dependencies between row and column operations, it's not straightforward.

An alternative way is to consider that each operation (row or column) can be seen as assigning a permutation to that row or column, and the final value of a cell is determined by the last operation that sets it.

Given that, to maximize the sum, we should aim to have as many cells as possible set by operations that assign higher values.

One way to achieve this is to perform operations in such a way that the highest possible values are assigned to as many cells as possible, minimizing overwrites that decrease the cell's value.

But this is still vague.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of operations.

We have at most 2n operations.

Each row operation affects n cells, and each column operation affects n cells.

However, there is overlap when both row and column operations are performed.

### A Different Perspective

Let's consider that each cell can be set independently if we perform both a row and a column operation.

But since operations are permutations, the values are interdependent.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the sum contributed by row operations and column operations.

Each row operation contributes the sum of its permutation, which is n(n+1)/2.

Similarly for column operations.

If we perform k row operations and m column operations, with k + m <= 2n, the total sum would be k * [n(n+1)/2] + m * [n(n+1)/2] minus the sum of the overlaps (cells set by both a row and a column operation).

The overlap for each cell where both a row and a column operation are performed would be the value from the column operation, as it is the last operation.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a better approach.

### Optimal Sum Calculation

Looking back at the program's formula:

\[
s = \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1)}{6}
\]

And comparing it to my earlier calculation:

\[
s = \frac{n^2 (n + 1)}{2}
\]

These are different.

For n=2:

- Program's sum: (2 * 3 * 7)/6 = 7

- My sum: (4 * 3)/2 = 6

The example shows that 7 is achievable, so my earlier assumption was incorrect.

Hence, the program's sum seems to be correct for n=2.

Let me check for n=3.

Program's sum:

\[
s = \frac{3 \times 4 \times 11}{6} = \frac{132}{6} = 22
\]

My sum:

\[
s = \frac{9 \times 4}{2} = 18
\]

But according to the program's formula, it's 22.

So, clearly, the program's formula gives a higher sum, which suggests that my initial approach was incorrect.

I need to find out how the program arrives at this formula.

Looking at the operations:

- Perform type 1 operations on all rows: sets each row to [n, n-1, ..., 1]

- Then perform type 2 operations on all columns: sets each column to [n, n-1, ..., 1]

After all row operations, the matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n & n-1 & \cdots & 1 \\
n & n-1 & \cdots & 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
n & n-1 & \cdots & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Then, after column operations:

- For each column j, set a_{1,j} = n, a_{2,j} = n-1, ..., a_{n,j} = 1

So, the final matrix would be:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n & n & \cdots & n \\
n-1 & n-1 & \cdots & n-1 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Wait, but in the example for n=2, the sum is 7, but according to this, it should be 6.

This contradicts the example.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the operations are applied.

Let me look again.

In the example for n=2:

Operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1: set row 1 to [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2: set row 2 to [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [1,2]

After operation 1: matrix = [1,2; 0,0]

After operation 2: matrix = [1,2; 1,2]

After operation 3: set column 1 to [1,2], so matrix becomes [1,2; 2,2]

Sum: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7

But according to my earlier assumption, if I perform all row operations first and then all column operations, the matrix would be:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n & n-1 & \cdots & 1 \\
n & n-1 & \cdots & 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
n & n-1 & \cdots & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Then, after column operations:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n & n & \cdots & n \\
n-1 & n-1 & \cdots & n-1 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Sum: n * (n + (n-1) + ... + 1) = n * n(n+1)/2 = n^2(n+1)/2

But for n=2, this would be 8, but in the example, it's 7.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me consider that when performing column operations, the values are assigned to each cell in the column, overwriting any previous values set by row operations.

Hence, for each column, the cells are set to [n, n-1, ..., 1], overwriting whatever was set by row operations.

So, the final matrix would have each column set to [n, n-1, ..., 1], meaning that the matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
n & n & \cdots & n \\
n-1 & n-1 & \cdots & n-1 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Sum: n * (n + (n-1) + ... + 1) = n * n(n+1)/2 = n^2(n+1)/2

But in the example, sum is 7, which matches n=2: 2*2*(3)/2 = 6, but the example shows 7.

Wait, there must be a mistake.

Wait, in the example, the operations are:

1. Type 1 on row 1: set row 1 to [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2: set row 2 to [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [1,2]

After operation 1: [1,2; 0,0]

After operation 2: [1,2; 1,2]

After operation 3: [1,2; 2,2]

Sum: 1+2+2+2=7

But according to my earlier assumption, the final matrix should be [n,n; n-1,n-1], which for n=2 is [2,2;1,1], sum=6.

But in the example, by performing operations in a specific order, they achieved a sum of 7.

Hence, my assumption is incorrect.

I need to find a better strategy.

### Correct Approach

Let me consider that each cell can be set by either a row operation or a column operation, with the last operation determining its value.

To maximize the sum, I should aim to set each cell with the highest possible value from either a row or a column operation.

An optimal strategy is to perform operations in such a way that the highest possible values are assigned to as many cells as possible, preferably without overwriting higher values with lower ones.

One way to achieve this is to perform row operations first, setting each row to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then perform column operations, setting each column to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

However, as seen in the example, this leads to a sum of 7 for n=2, not 6.

So, perhaps the sum is indeed higher than my initial calculation.

Let me try to compute the sum for n=2 manually.

Matrix after operations:

- After row operations: [2,1; 2,1]

- After column operations: set column 1 to [2,1], so matrix becomes [2,1; 1,1]

Sum: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

But in the example, they achieve 7.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the operations.

Wait, in the example, they perform type 1 operations with [1,2] instead of [2,1].

Wait, in the example, operations are:

1. Type 1 on row 1: set row 1 to [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2: set row 2 to [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [1,2]

After operation 1: [1,2; 0,0]

After operation 2: [1,2; 1,2]

After operation 3: [1,2; 2,2]

Sum: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7

So, using [1,2] instead of [2,1] allows higher values in some cells.

This suggests that choosing the permutation carefully can lead to a higher sum.

But in the program, they use [n, n-1, ..., 1] for both row and column operations.

Maybe using [1,2,...,n] instead allows higher sums in some cases.

Let me try n=2 with [1,2] for rows and [2,1] for columns.

Operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1: set row 1 to [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2: set row 2 to [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [2,1]

After operation 1: [1,2; 0,0]

After operation 2: [1,2; 1,2]

After operation 3: [2,2; 1,2]

Sum: 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7

Same as the example.

But if I use [2,1] for rows and [2,1] for columns:

Operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1: set row 1 to [2,1]

2. Type 1 on row 2: set row 2 to [2,1]

3. Type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [2,1]

After operation 1: [2,1; 0,0]

After operation 2: [2,1; 2,1]

After operation 3: [2,1; 1,1]

Sum: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5, which is less than 7.

So, using [1,2] for rows and [2,1] for columns gives a higher sum.

Hence, the order of the permutation matters.

But in the program, they use [n, n-1, ..., 1] for both rows and columns.

For n=2, [2,1] for rows and [2,1] for columns gives a sum of 5, which is less than 7.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem description, it's acceptable as long as the sum is correct, regardless of the operations, as long as m <= 2n.

But in this case, the sum calculated by the program is 7 for n=2, which matches the example.

But in the program, for n=2, using [2,1] for rows and columns gives sum=5, which is less than 7.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me check the program's operations for n=2.

The program prints:

1. Type 1 on row 1: [2,1]

2. Type 1 on row 2: [2,1]

3. Type 2 on column 1: [2,1]

4. Type 2 on column 2: [2,1]

So, operations:

1. Set row 1 to [2,1]

2. Set row 2 to [2,1]

3. Set column 1 to [2,1]

4. Set column 2 to [2,1]

Matrix after operations:

- After operation 1: [2,1; 0,0]

- After operation 2: [2,1; 2,1]

- After operation 3: [2,1; 1,1]

- After operation 4: [2,1; 1,1]

Sum: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5, which is less than the example's 7.

So, the program's operations do not achieve the maximum sum for n=2.

But according to the program's print statement, it claims the sum is 7.

Wait, for n=2, the program prints:

Sum: (2 * 3 * 7)/6 = 7

But according to the operations, the sum is 5.

This suggests that the program's sum calculation is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it claims a sum of 7 for n=2, but with the operations it performs, the sum is actually 5, which is less than the achievable sum of 7 as shown in the example.

Therefore, the program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix elements as per the problem's requirements.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{False}} \]
