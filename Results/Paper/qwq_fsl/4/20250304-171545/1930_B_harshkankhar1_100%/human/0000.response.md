Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to generate a permutation of numbers from 1 to n such that there are no two distinct indices i and j (where 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j) where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. The program is given, and I need to determine if it always produces a correct permutation for any valid input n between 3 and 10^5.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The task is to find a permutation p of length n where no two pairs (i, j) exist such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}, with i ≠ j and both within the valid range.

The program provided is:

```

for _ in range(int(input())):

    func_1()

def func_1():

    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))

    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]

    print(*a)

```

So, for each test case, it reads n, creates a list a from 1 to n, reverses every second element, and prints the list.

Let me try to understand what this does. For example, if n=4:

Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4]

a[::2] are elements at even indices (0-based): 1,3

Reversing them: 3,1

So the list becomes: [3,2,1,4]

For n=5:

Original: [1,2,3,4,5]

a[::2]: 1,3,5 reversed to 5,3,1

So the list becomes: [5,2,3,4,1]

Now, I need to check if these permutations satisfy the condition mentioned in the problem.

The condition is that there should not exist two distinct indices i and j such that:

- p_i divides p_j

- p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}

And this should hold for all possible n in the range [3, 10^5], for multiple test cases up to 10^3.

First, I should check if the permutation generated is indeed a permutation, meaning it contains all numbers from 1 to n exactly once.

In the examples above:

For n=4: [3,2,1,4] — yes, all numbers from 1 to 4 are present.

For n=5: [5,2,3,4,1] — yes, all numbers from 1 to 5 are present.

Seems like this step is satisfied.

Next, I need to ensure that no two pairs (i,j) exist that violate the condition.

Let's take n=4: [3,2,1,4]

Let's consider all possible pairs (i,j) where 1 ≤ i, j < 4 and i ≠ j.

Possible pairs:

(i=1, j=2): p1=3 divides p2=2? No, because 3 does not divide 2.

p2=2 divides p3=1? No, because 2 does not divide 1.

So, no violation.

(i=1, j=3): p1=3 divides p3=1? Yes, 3 divides 1? No.

p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes, 2 divides 4.

But since p1 does not divide p3, the overall condition is not violated.

(i=2, j=3): p2=2 divides p3=1? No.

p3=1 divides p4=4? Yes, 1 divides 4.

But since p2 does not divide p3, overall condition not violated.

(i=1, j=4): But j=4 is out of range since j < n=4.

Similarly, check for n=5: [5,2,3,4,1]

Possible pairs (i,j):

(i=1,j=2): p1=5 divides p2=2? No.

p2=2 divides p3=3? No.

(i=1,j=3): p1=5 divides p3=3? No.

p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes.

But p1 does not divide p3, so overall no violation.

(i=1,j=4): p1=5 divides p4=4? No.

p2=2 divides p5=1? No.

(i=2,j=3): p2=2 divides p3=3? No.

p3=3 divides p4=4? No.

(i=2,j=4): p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes.

p3=3 divides p5=1? No.

So, no violation.

(i=3,j=4): p3=3 divides p4=4? No.

p4=4 divides p5=1? No.

Seems fine.

But is this generalizable for all n?

Let me think about n=3: [1,2,3]

Check pairs:

(i=1,j=2): p1=1 divides p2=2? Yes.

p2=2 divides p3=3? No.

So, no violation.

(i=1,j=3): p1=1 divides p3=3? Yes.

p2=2 divides p4? j=3, but j < n=3, so j=2.

Wait, j < n, so j=2.

Wait, in the problem, j < n, but j can be equal to i.

Wait, the problem says 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j.

So for n=3, possible pairs:

(i=1,j=2), (i=2,j=1), (i=1,j=3), (i=3,j=1), (i=2,j=3), (i=3,j=2).

But j < n, so j=1,2 only since n=3.

So, pairs: (1,2), (1,2), (2,1).

Wait, indices start from 1.

So, for n=3, pairs where 1 ≤ i, j < 3 and i ≠ j.

So, i=1, j=2; i=2, j=1.

Check:

(i=1,j=2): p1=1 divides p2=2? Yes.

p2=2 divides p3=3? No.

So, no violation.

(i=2,j=1): p2=2 divides p1=1? No.

p3=3 divides p2=2? No.

So, no violation.

Seems fine.

But is there any n where this might fail?

Let me think about larger n, say n=6.

Generate permutation: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Wait, n=6: list(range(1,7)) = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

a[::2] = 1,3,5 reversed to 5,3,1

So, list becomes: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Now, check pairs (i,j) where 1 ≤ i, j < 6 and i ≠ j.

Lots of pairs to check, but let's pick a few.

(i=1,j=2): p1=5 divides p2=2? No.

p2=2 divides p3=3? No.

(i=1,j=3): p1=5 divides p3=3? No.

p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes.

But p1 does not divide p3, so no violation.

(i=1,j=4): p1=5 divides p4=4? No.

p2=2 divides p5=1? No.

(i=1,j=5): p1=5 divides p5=1? No.

p2=2 divides p6=6? Yes.

But p1 does not divide p5, so no violation.

(i=2,j=3): p2=2 divides p3=3? No.

p3=3 divides p4=4? No.

(i=2,j=4): p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes.

p3=3 divides p5=1? No.

So, no violation.

(i=3,j=4): p3=3 divides p4=4? No.

p4=4 divides p5=1? No.

(i=3,j=5): p3=3 divides p5=1? No.

p4=4 divides p6=6? Yes.

(i=4,j=5): p4=4 divides p5=1? No.

p5=1 divides p6=6? Yes.

Seems okay.

But maybe there's a specific n where this pattern fails.

Let me consider n=7: [5,2,3,4,1,6,7]

Check pairs.

This seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a pattern or a general proof.

Looking back at the way the permutation is generated: reverse every second element.

So, for n even:

Original: 1,2,3,4,...,n

After reversing every second: position 0,2,4,... reversed.

For n odd: similar.

Is there a mathematical property here that ensures the condition is met?

Alternatively, maybe think about the properties of divisibility in the permutation.

We need to ensure that for any i ≠ j, it's not the case that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

In other words, avoid having p_j being a multiple of p_i and p_{j+1} being a multiple of p_{i+1}.

Given that, perhaps the way the permutation is constructed avoids this by mixing up the order in a way that breaks such divisibility chains.

But is this always true?

Let me try to find a counterexample.

Suppose n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

Let's check (i=2,j=4): p2=2 divides p4=4? Yes.

p3=3 divides p5=1? No.

So, no violation.

Another pair: (i=4,j=6): p4=4 divides p6=6? No.

p5=1 divides p7? j=6, j+1=7, but n=6, so p7 doesn't exist.

Wait, j < n, so j=5.

Wait, j < n=6, so j=1 to 5.

So j=5: p5=1 divides p6=6? Yes.

But p4=4 divides p5=1? No.

So, no violation.

Another n=8: [7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8]

Generated from 1 to 8, reverse every second: positions 0,2,4,6 become 7,5,3,1.

So list is [7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8]

Check pairs.

This seems complicated. Maybe I should look for specific cases where divisibility conditions might hold.

For example, look for i and j where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

Let me consider n=9: [7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8,9]

Generated: positions 0,2,4,6,8 reversed: 9,3,5,1,7.

Wait, no.

Wait, a = list(range(1,10)) = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

a[::2] = 1,3,5,7,9 reversed to 9,7,5,3,1

So, list becomes: [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1]

Now, check for pairs (i,j):

Let's take i=3, j=7:

p3=7, p7=3: 7 does not divide 3.

p4=4, p8=8: 4 divides 8.

But since p3 does not divide p7, no violation.

Another pair: i=2, j=4:

p2=2, p4=4: 2 divides 4.

p3=7, p5=5: 7 does not divide 5.

No violation.

Another pair: i=4, j=6:

p4=4, p6=6: 4 does not divide 6.

p5=5, p7=3: 5 does not divide 3.

No violation.

But is there any pair where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}?

Let me check i=1, j=5:

p1=9, p5=5: 9 does not divide 5.

p2=2, p6=6: 2 divides 6.

But p1 does not divide p5, so no violation.

i=1, j=7:

p1=9, p7=3: 9 divides 3.

p2=2, p8=8: 2 divides 8.

Wait, p1 divides p7 and p2 divides p8.

But according to the problem, i and j should be such that 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j.

Here, j=7 < n=9, i=1 ≠ j=7.

So, this seems to be a violation.

Wait, p1=9 divides p7=3? Wait, 9 divides 3? Yes, because 3 is 9/3.

Wait, but in terms of divisibility, if a divides b, it means b is a multiple of a.

Wait, 9 divides 3? No, 3 divides 9.

Wait, I think I'm confusing this.

Actually, 9 divides 3 is false. Because 3 is not a multiple of 9.

Wait, no, 9 divides 3 means 3 is a multiple of 9, which is not true.

Wait, no, divisibility is defined as a divides b if b is a multiple of a.

So, a|b if there exists an integer k such that b = k*a.

So, 9 divides 3 would mean 3 = k*9 for some integer k, which is not possible unless k is fractional, which it can't be. So, 9 does not divide 3.

Wait, but in programming terms, we can check using the modulo operator.

In Python, 3 % 9 == 3, which is not zero, so 9 does not divide 3.

So, no violation.

Phew, that was a mistake.

So, no violation in this case.

Another n=10:

Generate list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

a[::2] = 1,3,5,7,9 reversed to 9,7,5,3,1

So, list becomes: [9,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,1,10]

Check pairs.

Let's see i=3, j=7:

p3=7, p7=3: 7 does not divide 3.

p4=4, p8=8: 4 divides 8.

No violation.

i=1, j=5:

p1=9, p5=5: 9 does not divide 5.

p2=2, p6=6: 2 divides 6.

No violation.

i=2, j=4:

p2=2, p4=4: 2 divides 4.

p3=7, p5=5: 7 does not divide 5.

No violation.

i=4, j=6:

p4=4, p6=6: 4 does not divide 6.

p5=5, p7=3: 5 does not divide 3.

No violation.

i=5, j=9:

p5=5, p9=1: 5 does not divide 1.

p6=6, p10=10: 6 does not divide 10.

Wait, 6 divides 10? 10 % 6 == 4, so no.

So, no violation.

Seems like this pattern is working for these n.

But is there a general proof or a counterexample?

Let me think differently.

Suppose n is even.

The list is arranged such that every second element is reversed.

So, positions 0,2,4,... have the largest, next largest, etc., in descending order.

While positions 1,3,5,... have the smallest, next smallest, etc., in ascending order.

Wait, in n=4: [3,2,1,4]

n=5: [5,2,3,4,1]

n=6: [5,2,3,4,1,6]

n=7: [5,2,3,4,1,6,7]

n=8: [7,2,3,4,5,6,1,8]

Wait, n=8: a[::2] = 1,3,5,7 reversed to 7,5,3,1

So list is [7,2,5,4,3,6,1,8]

Seems like the even positions have descending order of the first half, and odd positions have ascending order starting from 2.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps think about the properties of the permutation.

Another approach: perhaps the generated permutation avoids the condition because the way elements are arranged minimizes the chances of p_i dividing p_j and p_{i+1} dividing p_{j+1} simultaneously.

But to be sure, I need to see if there exists any n where this fails.

Alternatively, maybe consider the properties of divisibility in the permutation.

For example, in the permutation, ensure that for any i ≠ j, p_j is not a multiple of p_i or p_{j+1} is not a multiple of p_{i+1}.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe consider small n and see.

For n=3: [1,2,3]

Check (i=1,j=2): p1=1 divides p2=2? Yes.

p2=2 divides p3=3? No.

No violation.

(i=1,j=3): p1=1 divides p3=3? Yes.

p2=2 divides p4? j=3, j+1=4 > n, so maybe not applicable.

Wait, j < n, so j=1,2 only.

For n=3, j < 3, so j=1,2.

So, for i=1,j=2: as above.

i=2,j=1: p2=2 divides p1=1? No.

p3=3 divides p2=2? No.

No violation.

Seems fine.

Seems like for n=7, no violations.

This is getting tedious. Maybe there's a better way.

Perhaps I should consider the properties of the permutation generated.

The permutation is created by reversing every second element of the list from 1 to n.

So, for even n:

- Positions 0,2,4,... have the largest, next largest, etc.

- Positions 1,3,5,... have the smallest, next smallest, etc.

For odd n:

- Similar, but the middle element is in place or adjusted based on the reverse.

This seems to interleave larger and smaller numbers in a specific pattern.

Perhaps this arrangement minimizes the chances of having p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} simultaneously.

But to be sure, I need to see if there's any n where this fails.

Let me consider larger n, say n=10.

Whew, that's a lot of checking. But it seems that for n=10, there are no violations.

At this point, I'm starting to think that this permutation generation method might always satisfy the condition. But to be thorough, I need to see if there's any n where it fails.

Let me consider n=12.

Generate permutation: [11,2,9,4,7,6,5,8,3,10,1,12]

Wait, list(range(1,13)) =
