Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program meets all the requirements for every possible input case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

First, I need to understand the problem description fully. Three friends play chess games where in each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. The scores after all games are p1, p2, and p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or print -1 if such scores are impossible.

The program given is:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
```

I need to verify if this program correctly computes the maximum number of draws for any given input that satisfies p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

Let's start by understanding the logic of the program.

1. **Total Points and Parity:**

   - The program first checks if the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is even. If not, it prints -1.

   - This makes sense because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win and loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw), so the total points should always be even.

2. **Case when p3 >= p1 + p2:**

   - If p3 is greater than or equal to the sum of p1 and p2, the program prints p1 + p2.

   - This seems to be based on the idea that the maximum draws occur when p3 plays against p1 and p2, giving p1 and p2 as many draws as possible.

3. **General Case:**

   - For other cases, it calculates low and high based on p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, then iterates from low to high to find a suitable number of draws.

   - If it finds a valid number of draws, it prints p1 - cur + p3; otherwise, it prints p3.

This logic seems a bit convoluted, and I need to verify if it correctly computes the maximum draws in all scenarios.

Let's consider some test cases to verify the program.

**Test Case 1:**

Input:

```

1

0 0 0

```

Expected Output:

```

0

```

Explanation:

No games were played, so no draws.

Program Output:

```

0

```

This matches the expected output.

**Test Case 2:**

Input:

```

1

0 1 1

```

Expected Output:

```

1

```

Explanation:

One game between player 2 and 3, which ended in a draw.

Program Output:

```

1

```

This matches the expected output.

**Test Case 3:**

Input:

```

1

1 1 1

```

Expected Output:

```

-1

```

Explanation:

It's impossible to have scores 1,1,1 because total points are 3, which is odd.

Program Output:

```

-1

```

This matches the expected output.

**Test Case 4:**

Input:

```

1

1 1 2

```

Expected Output:

```

2

```

Explanation:

Possible games:

- Game 1: Player 2 vs Player 3, draw (1-1)

- Game 2: Player 1 vs Player 2, draw (1-1)

Total draws: 2

Program Output:

```

2

```

This matches the expected output.

**Test Case 5:**

Input:

```

1

3 3 3

```

Expected Output:

```

-1

```

Explanation:

Total points are 9, which is odd, so impossible.

Program Output:

```

-1

```

This matches the expected output.

**Test Case 6:**

Input:

```

1

3 4 5

```

Expected Output:

```

6

```

Explanation:

Total points are 12, which is even.

Possible games:

- Several games resulting in maximum draws.

Program Output:

```

6

```

This matches the expected output.

**Test Case 7:**

Input:

```

1

1 1 10

```

Expected Output:

```

2

```

Explanation:

Not sure about this. Let's verify.

Total points: 12, which is even.

Possible games:

- Player 1 and Player 2 play and draw once (1-1)

- Player 1 and Player 3 play multiple times.

But it's hard to achieve p3=10 with p1=1 and p2=1.

Wait, p1 and p2 are both 1, and p3 is 10.

If p1 and p2 play against each other and draw once, giving p1=1 and p2=1.

Then p3 can play against p1 and p2 multiple times.

But p3 can gain up to 2 points per game against p1 or p2.

To reach p3=10, p3 needs to play 5 games (each game gives up to 2 points).

But p1 and p2 only have 1 point each, which might not be sufficient.

This seems tricky. Let's see what the program outputs.

Program Output:

```

2

```

But according to the example output provided, it's 2.

I need to check if this is possible.

Let's try to see:

- p1 and p2 play once and draw, so p1=1, p2=1.

- p3 plays against p1 five times, winning all, so p3 gets 10 points (5*2), but p1 remains 1.

Wait, but if p3 plays against p1 and wins, p3 gets 2 and p1 gets 0, but p1 already has 1 from the earlier draw.

So, p1 cannot have 1 and also lose to p3.

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps p3 plays against p1 and draws some games.

Let's think differently.

- p1 and p2 play and draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- p3 plays against p1 four times: two draws and two wins.

- Draws: each draw gives p3=1 and p1=1, but p1 already has 1, so p1 cannot have more than 1.

Wait, p1's total is constrained to 1.

This is getting complicated.

Given that p1 and p2 are both 1, and p3 is 10, it's challenging to see how this is possible without violating the constraints.

Perhaps the program incorrectly outputs 2 in this case.

But according to the example output, it's 2, so maybe there is a way.

I need to think differently.

Assume p1 and p2 play and draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

Then p3 plays against p1 and p2 in such a way that p3 gains points without affecting p1 and p2's points beyond their current values.

But p3 cannot play against p1 or p2 without affecting their points.

If p3 wins against p1, p1's points decrease, which is not possible since p1 is already at 1.

So, perhaps it's impossible, but the program outputs 2.

This might be an error in the program.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrectly handling this case.

Hence, the program might be incorrect.

But according to the example output, it's 2, so maybe there is a way to achieve it.

I need to think carefully.

Let's consider:

- p1 and p2 play and draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- p3 plays against p1 nine times: p3 wins eight times and draws once.

- So, for the draws: p1=1 (from the first draw) +1 (from drawing once with p3) =2, but p1 is supposed to be 1, so this violates.

Hence, it's impossible to have p1=1, p2=1, p3=10.

Therefore, the program should output -1, but it outputs 2.

This indicates that the program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**.

**Additional Explanation:**

The program incorrectly outputs 2 for the input 1 1 10, whereas it should output -1 because it's impossible to achieve such scores given the constraints of the game.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all possible input cases, leading to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
