Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program is completely correct.

First, I need to understand the problem description fully. It's about helping Sasha rearrange an array to maximize the "beauty" of the array. The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, essentially, it's the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearrangement.

I need to think about what this sum represents. Let's expand it:

Sum = (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + (a4 - a3) + ... + (an - a_{n-1})

If I look closely, this is a telescoping sum where most terms cancel out:

Sum = an - a1

So, the beauty of the array is simply the difference between the last and the first element after rearrangement.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Is that correct? Let's test it with the example given.

In the first test case:

n = 3

a = [2, 1, 3]

If we sort it to [1, 2, 3], then sum = (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the example.

In the second test case:

n = 3

a = [69, 69, 69]

Sorted: [69, 69, 69]

Sum = (69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0, which matches.

Third test case:

n = 5

a = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]

Sorted: [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]

Sum = (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57, which matches.

Fourth test case:

n = 4

a = [3, 4, 3, 3]

Sorted: [3, 3, 3, 4]

Sum = (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, which matches.

Fifth test case:

n = 2

a = [2, 1]

Sorted: [1, 2]

Sum = (2 - 1) = 1, which matches.

So, the pattern holds for these examples. Therefore, the beauty is indeed an - a1 after sorting.

Given that, the goal is to maximize an - a1. To maximize this difference, we should arrange the array such that a1 is as small as possible and an is as large as possible. Sorting the array in ascending order achieves this.

Wait, but in the examples, they sorted in ascending order, and it worked. But would sorting in descending order give a different result?

Let's try the first test case with descending sort:

a = [3, 2, 1]

Sum = (2 - 3) + (1 - 2) = -1 + (-1) = -2

That's less than the ascending sort sum of 2. So, ascending sort maximizes the sum.

Wait, but the problem asks to rearrange the array to obtain the maximum beauty. So, is ascending sort always better?

Let me consider another example:

n = 4

a = [1, 2, 4, 3]

Ascending sort: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Sum = (2-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Descending sort: [4, 3, 2, 1]

Sum = (3-4) + (2-3) + (1-2) = -1 + (-1) + (-1) = -3

Another arrangement: [1, 3, 2, 4]

Sum = (3-1) + (2-3) + (4-2) = 2 + (-1) + 2 = 3

Another arrangement: [2, 4, 1, 3]

Sum = (4-2) + (1-4) + (3-1) = 2 + (-3) + 2 = 1

So, in all these cases, the maximum sum is achieved by ascending sort.

Wait, but according to the earlier deduction, sum = an - a1. So, to maximize sum, we need to maximize an and minimize a1. Sorting in ascending order achieves this.

Wait, but in ascending order, a1 is minimized and an is maximized, so an - a1 is maximized.

In descending order, a1 is maximized and an is minimized, so an - a1 is minimized.

Hence, ascending sort gives the maximum possible sum, which is an - a1.

So, the strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and compute the sum as an - a1.

But in the examples, they are printing the sum, which is an - a1.

Wait, but in the program provided, it's sorting the array and printing the sorted array as strings joined by spaces.

Wait, hold on. Let's look at the program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))

print(' '.join(ar))

}

So, this function reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n, reads the array, sorts it in ascending order, converts each element to string, joins them with spaces, and prints the result.

But according to the problem description, we need to output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array, which is an - a1 after sorting.

But in the examples, they are printing the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n, which, as we saw, is equal to an - a1.

But in the program, they are printing the sorted array.

Wait, that's a problem. The program is printing the sorted array, but according to the problem, it should print the sum, which is an - a1.

Looking back at the examples:

Input:

5

3

2 1 3

3

69 69 69

5

100 54 80 43 90

4

3 4 3 3

2

2 1

Output:

2

0

57

1

1

But according to the program, it would print:

1 2 3

69 69 69

43 54 80 90 100

3 3 3 4

1 2

Wait, but in the examples, it's showing sums: 2, 0, 57, 1, 1.

But the program is printing the sorted arrays.

So, the program is incorrect because it's not printing the sum, but rather the sorted array.

Wait, but in the problem description, it says:

"output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained."

But the program is printing the sorted array.

Hence, this is incorrect.

Wait, but in the examples, they are showing sums, but the program is printing sorted arrays.

Hence, the program does not match the problem requirements.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**.

But wait, maybe I misread something.

Let me check again.

Problem description says:

"For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained."

But the program is printing the sorted array.

Hence, it's incorrect.

But in the examples, they show sums, but the program would print sorted arrays.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Wait, but maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the program is correct, and the sum is equal to an - a1, which is the last element minus the first element in the sorted array.

But in the program, it's printing the sorted array, not the sum.

Wait, no, it's printing the sorted array, but according to the problem, it should print a single integer, which is the sum.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem understanding.

Wait, let's double-check.

The beauty is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n.

Which, as we saw, is equal to an - a1.

So, to maximize beauty, we need to maximize an - a1.

By sorting in ascending order, a1 is the smallest, an is the largest, so an - a1 is maximized.

Hence, the program should sort the array and then compute an - a1 and print that.

But currently, it's printing the sorted array.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the program is intended to print the sorted array, and the sum is just a byproduct for explanation.

But according to the problem, it should print the sum, which is the beauty.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**.

But in the examples, they show sums, but according to the program, it should print sorted arrays.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the sum is equal to an - a1, so maybe the program is intended to compute an - a1 and print that.

But in the program, it's printing the sorted array.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the program is correct, and the sum is equal to an - a1, which is what's being computed implicitly.

But still, the program is printing the sorted array, not the sum.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in Python, the sum of differences is equal to an - a1, so maybe the program is just printing an - a1 indirectly by sorting.

But no, it's explicitly printing the sorted array.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearrangement.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Beauty Calculation**:
   - The beauty of an array is calculated as \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).
   - This sum simplifies to \(a_n - a_1\) where \(a_n\) is the largest element and \(a_1\) is the smallest element in the array.

2. **Optimal Arrangement**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize \(a_n - a_1\).
   - This is achieved by sorting the array in ascending order, making \(a_1\) the smallest element and \(a_n\) the largest element.

3. **Implementation**:
   - For each test case, read the array and sort it.
   - Compute the beauty as the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array.
   - Output this difference for each test case.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar_sorted = sorted(ar)
        if n >= 2:
            beauty = ar_sorted[-1] - ar_sorted[0]
            print(beauty)
        else:
            print(0)  # If n < 2, beauty is 0 as there are no differences to sum

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read the integer \( n \) (length of the array) and the array elements.

2. **Sorting and Calculation**:
   - Sort the array in ascending order.
   - Calculate the beauty as the difference between the largest and smallest elements (\(a_n - a_1\)).

3. **Output**:
   - Print the calculated beauty for each test case.

This approach ensures that we maximize the beauty of the array by strategically arranging its elements to maximize the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is the essence of the problem.
