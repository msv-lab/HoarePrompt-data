Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether a given binary grid forms a square or a triangle based on the placement of '1's. The program provided seems quite simple, and I need to ensure it meets the requirements for all possible cases.

First, I need to understand the problem description thoroughly. The grid can contain either a square or a triangle made up of '1's, and I have to identify which one it is. The square is defined as k consecutive rows with k '1's in each row, aligned in the same columns. The triangle is defined as k rows where the i-th row has 2*i - 1 '1's, centered in the grid.

The program reads the input, processes each test case, and for each grid, it collects the counts of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1', and then checks if the counts in the first two rows are equal. If they are, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, "TRIANGLE".

Wait, but looking at the code:

```python

def func():

    a = int(input())

    for i in range(a):

        k = []

        for _ in range(int(input())):

            b = input()

            if '1' in b:

                k.append(b.count('1'))

        if k[0] == k[1]:

            print("SQUARE")

        else:

            print("TRIANGLE")

```

It seems there's a mistake in my previous interpretation. The code checks if the count of '1's in the first two rows (that contain at least one '1') are equal, and if they are, it concludes it's a square; otherwise, a triangle.

But is this logic sound? Let's think about it.

For a square, all rows of the shape should have the same number of '1's, aligned in the same columns. So, if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, it might be a square, but I need to ensure that all rows of the shape have the same number of '1's and that they are aligned properly.

For a triangle, the number of '1's increases in each row according to the formula 2*i - 1, where i is the row number. So, the first row has 1 '1', the second has 3, the third has 5, and so on.

The code only checks the first two rows with '1's and sees if their counts are equal. If they are, it assumes it's a square; otherwise, a triangle.

Is this sufficient?

Let me consider some cases.

**Case 1: A square**

Suppose n=3

Grid:

000

011

011

Here, the shape is a square of size 2.

The rows with '1's are:

011 -> 2 '1's

011 -> 2 '1's

So, k = [2, 2]

Since k[0] == k[1], it's a square. Correct.

**Case 2: A triangle**

n=3

Grid:

001

010

111

Here, the shape is a triangle with k=2.

Rows with '1's:

001 -> 1 '1'

010 -> 1 '1'

111 -> 3 '1's

But according to the code, it would take k = [1, 1], since the first two rows with '1's have 1 '1'. Since k[0] == k[1], it would conclude it's a square, which is incorrect because it's actually a triangle.

Wait, but according to the problem description, the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and it's guaranteed that the shape is larger than 1 '1'.

So, in this case, the grid contains a triangle, but the code would incorrectly identify it as a square.

This seems like a flaw in the logic.

**Another perspective:**

Maybe the code is assuming that if the first two rows with '1's have the same number of '1's, it's a square, else it's a triangle.

But in the triangle case, the number of '1's increases by 2 each row, starting from 1.

So, for a triangle with k rows, the number of '1's in each row should be 1, 3, 5, ..., up to 2*k - 1.

So, in the above case, with k=2, it should have 1 and 3 '1's in the rows.

But in the grid I considered, it has 1 and 1 '1's in the first two rows, which doesn't match the triangle pattern, so it should be identified as a square.

Wait, but according to the problem, the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, so if it's not a triangle, it must be a square, and vice versa.

In the example I gave, it's supposed to be a triangle, but the code would misidentify it as a square.

Wait, perhaps my grid isn't correctly representing a triangle.

Let me try another grid for a triangle.

n=3

Grid:

010

011

111

Here, the shape is a triangle with k=3.

Rows with '1's:

010 -> 1 '1'

011 -> 2 '1's

111 -> 3 '1's

So, k = [1, 2]

Since k[0] != k[1], it's a triangle. Correct.

But in the previous case, with k=2, the first two rows had 1 and 1, which is incorrect for a triangle, so the code would say it's a square, which is the correct identification because if it's not a triangle, it must be a square.

Wait, but in my first example, the grid was:

001

010

111

Which is intended to be a triangle, but according to the code, it would be identified as a square, which would be incorrect.

But according to the problem, each test case has exactly one triangle or one square, not both.

So, in this case, if it's supposed to be a triangle, but the code identifies it as a square, then the code is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the shape.

Let me look back at the problem description.

A triangle is defined as k consecutive rows where the i-th row has 2*i - 1 '1's, centered in one column.

So, for k=2, the triangle should have:

Row 1: 1 '1' (in the center)

Row 2: 3 '1's

So, in a 3x3 grid, it could look like:

0 0 1

0 1 1

1 1 1

Wait, but in this grid, the '1's don't form a centered triangle.

Let me try:

For k=2:

Row 1: 1 '1' in the center

Row 2: 3 '1's

So, in a 3x3 grid:

Positioned like:

0 0 1

0 1 1

1 1 1

Wait, but in this grid, the '1's are not forming a centered triangle because the second row has two '1's not centered.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the grid.

A proper triangle for k=2 would be:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 1 1

Here, the first row has one '1' in the center, the second row has one '1' in the center and the third row has three '1's.

Wait, but according to the problem, a triangle can be upside down.

So, perhaps the grid I initially considered doesn't correctly represent a triangle.

Let me consider another example.

n=4

Grid:

0 0 0 1

0 0 1 1

0 1 1 1

1 1 1 1

This should be a triangle with k=4.

Rows with '1's:

Row 1: 1 '1'

Row 2: 2 '1's

Row 3: 3 '1's

Row 4: 4 '1's

But according to the code, it would take k = [1, 2], since the first two rows with '1's have 1 and 2 '1's respectively. Since 1 != 2, it's a triangle. Correct.

If the grid is:

0 0 0

0 1 1

0 1 1

This is a square with k=2.

Rows with '1's:

Row 2: 2 '1's

Row 3: 2 '1's

So, k = [2, 2]. Since 2 == 2, it's a square. Correct.

Wait, but in the first example I gave, with n=3:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 1 1

This is intended to be a triangle with k=3.

Rows with '1's:

Row 1: 1 '1'

Row 2: 1 '1'

Row 3: 3 '1's

So, k = [1, 1]

According to the code, 1 == 1, so it's a square, which is incorrect because it's supposed to be a triangle.

Wait, but according to the problem, each test case has exactly one triangle or one square, not both.

So, if it's a triangle, the code should identify it as a triangle.

But in this case, the code identifies it as a square, which is wrong.

Hence, the code is flawed.

But perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that such a case doesn't occur.

Wait, no. The problem says that the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size is greater than 1.

But in the above grid, it's a triangle with k=3, but the code misidentifies it as a square.

So, perhaps the code is incomplete or incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the code is checking if the counts of '1's in the first two rows with '1's are equal. If they are, it's a square; else, a triangle.

But in the triangle case, the counts should be increasing by 2 each row starting from 1.

So, for k=2, triangle: 1 and 3 '1's.

For k=3: 1, 3, 5 '1's.

So, in the first two rows, for a triangle, it should be 1 and 3.

Hence, if the first two rows have different counts, it could be a triangle.

But in the square case, all rows should have the same number of '1's.

So, if the first two rows have the same count, it's likely a square.

But there might be edge cases where a triangle has the first two rows with the same count.

Wait, for k=1, triangle is not allowed since k>1.

For k=2, triangle has 1 and 3.

For k=3, 1 and 3 in the first two rows.

Wait, but in my earlier example, with k=3, rows have 1,1,3 '1's, which doesn't match the triangle pattern.

So, perhaps in that case, it's not a valid triangle.

Wait, but according to the problem, the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, so perhaps such a grid isn't possible.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, so I don't need to worry about invalid grids.

Hence, in that case, perhaps the code is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier example, with n=3:

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 1 1

This grid contains a triangle with k=3, but according to the code, it would be identified as a square, which is incorrect.

But according to the problem, it's guaranteed that the grid forms exactly one shape, either a triangle or a square.

So, perhaps such a grid isn't possible, or perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the shape definitions.

Let me look back at the problem description.

A triangle is defined as k consecutive rows where the i-th row has 2*i - 1 '1's, centered in one column.

So, for k=3, rows should have 1, 3, 5 '1's.

But in my grid, it has 1,1,3 '1's, which doesn't match the triangle pattern.

Hence, perhaps such a grid isn't possible under the problem's constraints, meaning that if it's supposed to be a triangle, it must have the correct number of '1's in each row.

Therefore, perhaps the code assumes that if the first two rows with '1's have the same count, it's a square; otherwise, it's a triangle.

Given that the grid is guaranteed to form exactly one shape, either a square or a triangle, and the code uses this heuristic, it might be correct.

But I'm still unsure.

Let me consider another example.

n=4

Grid:

0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0

0 1 0 0

1 1 1 0

This should be a triangle with k=3.

Rows with '1's:

Row 3: 1 '1'

Row 4: 3 '1's

So, k = [1, 3]

Since 1 != 3, it's a triangle. Correct.

Another example:

n=4

Grid:

0 0 0 0

0 1 1 0

0 1 1 0

0 0 0 0

This should be a square with k=2.

Rows with '1's:

Row 2: 2 '1's

Row 3: 2 '1's

So, k = [2, 2]

Since 2 == 2, it's a square. Correct.

Another example:

n=5

Grid:

0 0 1 1 1

0 0 0 1 0

0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0

This should be a square with k=2.

Rows with '1's:

Row 1: 3 '1's

Row 2: 1 '1'

So, k = [3,1]

Since 3 !=1, it's a triangle. But actually, it's a square, so the code is wrong.

Wait, but according to the problem, the grid contains exactly one square or one triangle.

So, perhaps such a grid isn't possible.

Wait, let's see.

A square is defined as k consecutive rows with k '1's in each row, aligned in the same columns.

In this grid, rows 1 and 2 have '1's.

Row 1: 3 '1's

Row 2: 1 '1'

This doesn't form a square, as the '1's aren't aligned in the same columns.

But according to the problem, the grid contains exactly one square or one triangle, so such a grid isn't possible.

Hence, perhaps the code is correct under the problem's constraints.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the shape is contiguous.

Wait, the problem says "k consecutive rows".

So, in the square case, it's k consecutive rows with k '1's in each row, aligned in the same columns.

In the triangle case, it's k consecutive rows where the i-th row has 2*i -1 '1's, centered in one column.

Given that, perhaps the code's logic of checking the first two rows with '1's is sufficient.

Let me think about it differently.

If the shape is a square, all rows of the shape will have the same number of '1's.

If it's a triangle, the number of '1's increases in each row.

So, if the first two rows with '1's have the same number of '1's, it's likely a square.

If they have different counts, it's likely a triangle.

Given that, and considering the problem's constraints that each grid contains exactly one shape, either a square or a triangle, perhaps this heuristic is sufficient.

But in my earlier example, with n=5:

00111

00010

00000

00000

00000

This is intended to be a square with k=2, but according to the code, k=[3,1], which are different, so it would be identified as a triangle, which is incorrect.

But perhaps this grid doesn't form a valid square under the problem's constraints.

Wait, in a square, it's k consecutive rows with k '1's in each row, aligned in the same columns.

In this grid, rows 1 and 2 have '1's.

Row 1 has 3 '1's, row 2 has 1 '1', which aren't aligned in the same columns, so it's not a valid square.

Hence, perhaps such a grid isn't possible under the problem's constraints, because it must contain exactly one square or one triangle.

Therefore, perhaps the code is correct.

Wait, but in the earlier example I considered, with n=3:

001

010

111

This grid is intended to be a triangle with k=3.

Rows with '1's:

Row1:1

Row2:1

Row3:3

So, k=[1,1], which are equal, so the code identifies it as a square, which is incorrect.

But perhaps this grid doesn't form a valid triangle under the problem's constraints.

According to the problem, a triangle must have rows with 2*i -1 '1's, where i is the row number.

So, for k=3, rows should have 1,3,5 '1's.

But in this grid, rows have 1,1,3 '1's, which doesn't match the triangle pattern.

Hence, perhaps such a grid isn't possible under the problem's constraints, meaning that the code is correct.

Therefore, perhaps the code's logic is sufficient under the problem's guarantees.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given binary grid forms a square or a triangle based on the placement of '1's. The grid is guaranteed to contain exactly one shape, either a square or a triangle, and the shape consists of more than one '1'.

### Approach

1. **Input Reading**:
   - Read the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Read the size of the grid, `n`.
     - Read the grid itself, consisting of `n` rows, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1').

2. **Shape Identification**:
   - Collect the counts of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'.
   - If the counts of '1's in the first two rows with '1's are equal, it is identified as a square.
   - If they are not equal, it is identified as a triangle.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        counts = [row.count('1') for row in grid if '1' in row]
        if counts[0] == counts[1]:
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            print("TRIANGLE")

func()
```

### Explanation

- **Reading Input**:
  - We first read the number of test cases, `t`.
  - For each test case, we read the grid size, `n`, and the grid itself.

- **Counting '1's**:
  - We collect the counts of '1's in rows that contain at least one '1' into the list `counts`.

- **Shape Determination**:
  - We compare the counts of '1's in the first two rows with '1's:
    - If they are equal, it is a square.
    - If they are different, it is a triangle.

This approach efficiently determines the shape based on the given criteria and is guaranteed to work correctly under the problem's constraints.
