Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to calculate the minimum cost for buying exactly n yogurts, given the regular price per yogurt and a promotional price for buying two yogurts. The program needs to handle multiple test cases, and for each case, output the minimum cost.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. Maxim wants to buy exactly n yogurts. Each yogurt normally costs a burles, but there's a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles. The goal is to minimize the total cost.

Let me think about how to approach this. For any number of yogurts n, Maxim can choose to buy as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and then buy the remaining yogurts at the regular price.

For example, if n is even, he can buy n/2 pairs at price b each. If n is odd, he can buy (n-1)/2 pairs at price b and one yogurt at price a.

However, there's a catch: the promotional price for two yogurts might not always be cheaper than buying two yogurts at the regular price. So, I need to ensure that the program considers both options: buying pairs at the promotional price or buying individual yogurts at the regular price.

Looking at the provided program:

```python

def func():

    for _ in range(int(input())):

        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

        if n > 1:

            ans1 = a * n

            ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)

            print(min(ans1, ans2))

        else:

            print(a)

```

This seems straightforward. It handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases first, then for each test case, it reads n, a, and b.

If n is greater than 1, it calculates two possible total costs:

- ans1: the cost of buying all n yogurts at the regular price, which is a * n.

- ans2: the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and any remaining yogurt at the regular price. This is b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2).

Then, it prints the minimum of ans1 and ans2.

If n is 1, it simply prints the regular price a, since pairs only apply to even numbers of yogurts.

I need to verify if this program always computes the correct minimum cost for any valid input.

Let me consider some examples to check its correctness.

**Example 1:**

Input:

2 5 9

According to the example output, it should be 9.

Let's see:

n = 2, a = 5, b = 9

ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10

ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (0) = 9 * 1 + 0 = 9

min(10, 9) = 9

Correct.

**Example 2:**

Input:

3 5 9

Output:

14

n = 3, a = 5, b = 9

ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15

ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (1) = 9 * 1 + 5 = 14

min(15, 14) = 14

Correct.

**Example 3:**

Input:

3 5 11

Output:

15

n = 3, a = 5, b = 11

ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15

ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (1) = 11 * 1 + 5 = 16

min(15, 16) = 15

Correct.

**Example 4:**

Input:

4 5 11

Output:

20

n = 4, a = 5, b = 11

ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20

ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (0) = 11 * 2 + 0 = 22

min(20, 22) = 20

Correct.

So, the program seems to work correctly for these examples.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

**Edge Case 1: n = 1**

Input:

1 10 15

Expected Output:

10

Because only one yogurt is bought at the regular price.

Program Output:

10

Correct.

**Edge Case 2: n = 0**

Input:

0 5 10

But according to the problem, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, so n=0 is invalid.

But let's see what the program does.

Since n=0 is less than or equal to 1, it would fall under the 'else' clause and print a, which is incorrect because buying 0 yogurts should cost 0.

Wait, but according to the problem, Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts, and n is at least 1 according to the constraints. So n=0 is invalid, but the program should handle it correctly if it's possible.

But since the problem says 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, n=0 is not a valid input, so the program doesn't need to handle it.

**Edge Case 3: n = 100, a = 30, b = 58**

This is to check for the maximum values.

ans1 = 30 * 100 = 3000

ans2 = 58 * (100 // 2) + 30 * (0) = 58 * 50 = 2900

min(3000, 2900) = 2900

Correct.

**Edge Case 4: n = 2, a = 1, b = 1**

ans1 = 1 * 2 = 2

ans2 = 1 * (2 // 2) + 1 * (0) = 1 * 1 + 0 = 1

min(2, 1) = 1

Correct.

**Edge Case 5: n = 2, a = 1, b = 2**

ans1 = 1 * 2 = 2

ans2 = 2 * (2 // 2) + 1 * (0) = 2 * 1 + 0 = 2

min(2, 2) = 2

Correct.

**Edge Case 6: n = 3, a = 1, b = 2**

ans1 = 1 * 3 = 3

ans2 = 2 * (3 // 2) + 1 * (1) = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3

min(3, 3) = 3

Correct.

**Edge Case 7: n = 5, a = 2, b = 3**

ans1 = 2 * 5 = 10

ans2 = 3 * (5 // 2) + 2 * (1) = 3 * 2 + 2 = 8

min(10, 8) = 8

Correct.

**Edge Case 8: n = 5, a = 2, b = 4**

ans1 = 2 * 5 = 10

ans2 = 4 * (5 // 2) + 2 * (1) = 4 * 2 + 2 = 10

min(10, 10) = 10

Correct.

**Edge Case 9: n = 5, a = 2, b = 5**

ans1 = 2 * 5 = 10

ans2 = 5 * (5 // 2) + 2 * (1) = 5 * 2 + 2 = 12

min(10, 12) = 10

Correct.

**Edge Case 10: n = 5, a = 3, b = 5**

ans1 = 3 * 5 = 15

ans2 = 5 * (5 // 2) + 3 * (1) = 5 * 2 + 3 = 13

min(15, 13) = 13

Correct.

All these edge cases seem to be handled correctly by the program.

Wait, let's think about another aspect. What if the promotional price for two yogurts is less than the price of one yogurt?

For example:

n = 3, a = 10, b = 15

ans1 = 10 * 3 = 30

ans2 = 15 * (3 // 2) + 10 * (1) = 15 * 1 + 10 = 25

min(30, 25) = 25

Which is correct.

Another scenario:

n = 4, a = 10, b = 15

ans1 = 10 * 4 = 40

ans2 = 15 * (4 // 2) + 10 * (0) = 15 * 2 = 30

min(40, 30) = 30

Correct.

What if the promotional price is higher than twice the regular price?

n = 2, a = 5, b = 12

ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10

ans2 = 12 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (0) = 12 * 1 = 12

min(10, 12) = 10

Correct.

What if n is 1, and promotional price is irrelevant?

n = 1, a = 5, b = 10

Output: 5

Correct.

What if n is 0? Wait, n cannot be 0 as per constraints.

What if n is very small, like 1 or 2?

Already covered.

What if n is odd and large, say n=99?

n=99, a=1, b=2

ans1 = 1 * 99 = 99

ans2 = 2 * (99 // 2) + 1 * (1) = 2 * 49 + 1 = 99

min(99,99)=99

Correct.

What if n is even and large, say n=100?

n=100, a=1, b=2

ans1 = 1 * 100 = 100

ans2 = 2 * (100 // 2) + 1 * (0) = 2 * 50 = 100

min(100,100)=100

Correct.

What if a and b are equal?

n=4, a=5, b=10

ans1 = 5*4=20

ans2 = 10*(4//2) + 5*(0)=10*2=20

min(20,20)=20

Correct.

What if b is less than a*2?

n=2, a=6, b=10

ans1=6*2=12

ans2=10*1+0=10

min(12,10)=10

Correct.

What if b is greater than a*2?

n=2, a=6, b=13

ans1=12

ans2=13

min(12,13)=12

Correct.

What if b is equal to a*2?

n=2, a=5, b=10

ans1=10

ans2=10

min(10,10)=10

Correct.

Seems like the program handles all these cases correctly.

Is there any case where the program might fail?

Let me think about n=1 again. The program handles it correctly by just printing a.

What about n=2? It should choose between ans1 and ans2 correctly based on which is cheaper.

Seems fine.

For n>2, it calculates ans2 as b*(n//2) + a*(n%2), which is correct.

I can't think of any case where this logic would fail.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]
