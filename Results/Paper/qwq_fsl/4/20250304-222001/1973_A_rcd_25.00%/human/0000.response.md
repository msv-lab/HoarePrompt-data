Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all edge cases to ensure the program is correct.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Three friends are playing chess games where two play against each other in each game. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. The scores after all games are p1, p2, and p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws possible, or -1 if such scores are impossible.

The program provided is supposed to handle multiple test cases, each with three integers p1, p2, p3. It checks if the sum of the scores is even, and based on that and other conditions, it calculates the maximum number of draws.

Let me look at the examples provided in the problem description to understand what's expected.

First example:

Input: 0 0 0

Output: 0

This makes sense because if no games were played, there are no draws.

Second example:

Input: 0 1 1

Output: 1

Probably, one game was played between player 2 and 3, resulting in a draw, so both have 1 point, and player 1 has 0.

Third example:

Input: 1 1 1

Output: -1

This suggests that it's impossible to have all three players with 1 point each, given the scoring rules.

Fourth example:

Input: 1 1 2

Output: 2

Not sure about this one yet, need to think.

Fifth example:

Input: 3 3 3

Output: -1

Again, seems impossible.

Sixth example:

Input: 3 4 5

Output: 6

Seventh example:

Input: 1 1 10

Output: 2

I need to make sure that the program handles all these cases correctly and more.

Looking at the program:

It reads the number of test cases, t, and then for each test case, it reads p1, p2, p3.

First, it checks if the sum of p1, p2, p3 is even. If not, it's impossible, so it prints -1.

If the sum is even, it proceeds.

Then, it checks if p3 is greater than or equal to p1 + p2. If so, it prints p1 + p2.

Otherwise, it calculates low and high based on p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and iterates to find the maximum draws.

This seems complicated. I need to understand the logic behind it.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Each game can be either a win (2 points to one player, 0 to the other) or a draw (1 point to each player).

So, for two players playing a game:

- If one wins, total points added are 2.

- If it's a draw, total points added are 2.

So, regardless of the outcome, each game adds 2 points to the total score.

Given that, the sum of p1 + p2 + p3 must be even, which the program checks.

Now, to maximize the number of draws, we need to maximize the number of games that ended in a draw.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Let’s denote:

- Let G be the total number of games played.

- Let D be the number of draws.

- Let W be the number of wins.

So, G = D + W.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total score (1 for each player), and each win also contributes 2 points (2 for the winner, 0 for the loser).

Therefore, total points = 2 * G.

But we also have p1 + p2 + p3 = 2 * G.

So, the sum must be even, which is already checked in the program.

Now, to maximize D, we need to maximize the number of draws, which means minimizing the number of wins.

However, the distribution of points must match p1, p2, p3.

Let me consider that in each draw, two specific players play and both get 1 point.

In each win, one specific player gets 2 points and the other gets 0.

Given that, I need to distribute the total points in such a way that the constraints are satisfied.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems involving point distributions, we can use systems of equations to model the interactions.

Let’s define:

Let’s denote the number of times players 1 and 2 play as G12, players 1 and 3 as G13, and players 2 and 3 as G23.

For each Gij, there can be draws Dij and wins Wij, where Dij + Wij = Gij.

Each draw Dij gives 1 point to both players i and j.

Each win Wij gives 2 points to one of the players and 0 to the other.

So, the total points for each player can be expressed in terms of Dij and Wij.

But this seems too complicated for this problem.

Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let’s consider the total number of draws.

Each draw involves two players, and contributes 1 point to each.

So, if there are D draws in total, involving various pairs, then the total points contributed by draws is 2D.

The remaining points must come from wins, where each win contributes 2 points to one player.

Let’s denote W as the number of wins.

Then, total points = 2D + 2W = 2(G), where G = D + W.

But I need to maximize D, given the specific p1, p2, p3.

I think I need to find the maximum D such that the points can be distributed accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over the possible number of draws and see if the points can be achieved.

But that might be inefficient.

Looking back at the program, it seems to handle different cases based on the values of p1, p2, p3.

Let me try to understand the program's logic.

First, it checks if the sum of p1, p2, p3 is even. If not, it's impossible, so it prints -1.

Then, if p3 is greater than or equal to p1 + p2, it prints p1 + p2.

Otherwise, it calculates low and high based on p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and iterates to find the maximum draws.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me consider the second example:

Input: 0 1 1

According to the program:

Sum is 2, which is even.

p3 = 1, p1 + p2 = 1, so p3 >= p1 + p2 is false.

Then, low = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2) = min(1 - 0, 1 - 1) = min(1, 0) = 0

high = max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2) = max(1, 0) = 1

Then, cur starts at 0.

Check if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):

0 - 0 <= 1 - (1 - 0) => 0 <= 0, which is true.

Then, print p1 - cur + p3 = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1.

Which matches the expected output.

Good.

Now, third example:

Input: 1 1 1

Sum is 3, which is odd, so print -1.

Correct, as per the sample output.

Fourth example:

Input: 1 1 2

Sum is 4, which is even.

p3 = 2, p1 + p2 = 2, so p3 >= p1 + p2 is true.

So, print p1 + p2 = 2.

Is this correct?

Let me think.

Possible games:

If players 2 and 3 play, and player 3 wins, then p3 gets 2, and p2 gets 0.

But p2 already has 1, which is from another game.

Wait, maybe multiple games.

Alternatively, if there are draws.

Wait, it's getting complicated.

Let me see.

Another way: total points are 4, so total games are 2.

To maximize draws, we need as many draws as possible.

But p1, p2, p3 are 1,1,2.

Is it possible to have two draws?

If there are two draws, each draw involves two players, and each player gets 1 point per draw.

So, if p1 and p2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

p1 and p3 draw once: p1=2, p3=1.

But p3 should be 2, but p1 would be 2, which doesn't match p1=1.

Alternatively, p1 and p2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

p2 and p3 draw once: p2=2, p3=1.

Now, p1=1, p2=2, p3=1, which doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Alternatively, p1 and p3 draw once: p1=1, p3=1.

p2 and p3 play and p3 wins: p3=3, p2=0.

But p3 should be 2, not 3.

Wait, maybe p2 and p3 play and draw: p2=1, p3=1.

Then p1 and p2 play and p2 wins: p2=3, p1=1.

But p2 should be 1, not 3.

Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Maybe it's not possible to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

But the sample output says 2, which is p1 + p2.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect here.

Wait, in the sample output, for input 1 1 2, output is 2.

But from my analysis, it seems impossible to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2 with any number of games.

Let me check the note in the problem.

In the third example, it says it's impossible, so output is -1.

Wait, third example is 1 1 1, which is impossible, output -1.

Fourth example is 1 1 2, output is 2.

But from my analysis, it seems impossible to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Maybe I'm missing something.

Let me think differently.

Suppose there are G games in total, with D draws and W wins, where G = D + W.

Total points: 2G.

Given p1 + p2 + p3 = 2G.

We need to maximize D.

Constraints:

- Each draw involves two specific players.

- Each win involves two specific players, with one getting 2 points and the other 0.

Also, the same pair can play multiple times.

I need to ensure that the points assigned respect the number of games played between each pair.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for a formula or a mathematical way to compute the maximum number of draws.

I recall that in some problems, the maximum number of draws is related to the minimum possible wins.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal number of wins required to achieve the points, and then the remaining games are draws.

But I need to maximize draws, so minimize wins.

Let me try to think in terms of minimal wins.

Each win affects the points of two players: one gains 2, the other gains 0.

Each draw makes both players gain 1.

Given that, I need to assign wins and draws such that the total points are p1, p2, p3.

This seems like a system of equations.

Let me denote:

Let’s say there are W12 wins in games between player 1 and 2, with player 1 winning.

Similarly, W21 wins with player 2 winning.

Similarly, W13, W31, W23, W32.

And D12, D13, D23 draws between respective pairs.

Then, the points can be expressed as:

p1 = 2*W12 + 2*W13 + D12 + D13

p2 = 2*W21 + 2*W23 + D12 + D23

p3 = 2*W31 + 2*W32 + D13 + D23

Also, the total number of games between each pair:

G12 = W12 + W21 + D12

G13 = W13 + W31 + D13

G23 = W23 + W32 + D23

This seems too complex to handle directly.

Maybe there is a better way.

I found a similar problem online, and one approach is to consider the minimal number of wins needed to achieve the points, and the rest can be draws.

But I need to maximize draws, which would mean minimizing wins.

But how?

Let me consider that draws contribute equally to both players involved, while wins contribute 2 to one and 0 to the other.

To maximize draws, we need to maximize the number of games where points are equally distributed between the players involved.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of wins required to achieve the points.

Let me consider that.

First, calculate the total points: p1 + p2 + p3 = 2G.

Then, the number of games is G.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total, and each win also contributes 2 points.

So, total points are always 2G, regardless of the number of draws or wins.

But I need to maximize draws, which is D.

Given that G = D + W, and total points are 2G, which is fixed.

So, to maximize D, I need to maximize the number of draws, which means minimizing W.

However, the distribution of points must match p1, p2, p3.

So, I need to find the minimal number of wins required to achieve the points.

Let me try to find a way to compute the minimal number of wins.

Each win affects the points by adding 2 to one player and 0 to the other.

Each draw adds 1 to both players involved.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the minimal number of wins as the sum of the differences in points needed, divided by 2.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the minimal number of wins required to achieve the highest score.

Let’s consider that.

If p3 is the highest score, then to achieve p3, that player must have won some games.

But this is getting too vague.

Let me look back at the program.

It has different cases:

1. If the sum is odd, impossible, so -1.

2. If p3 >= p1 + p2, then print p1 + p2.

3. Otherwise, it calculates low and high based on p3 - p1 and p3 - p2, and iterates to find the maximum draws.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Looking back at the fourth example:

Input: 1 1 2

Sum is 4, which is even.

p3 = 2, p1 + p2 = 2, so p3 >= p1 + p2 is true.

So, it prints p1 + p2 = 2.

But from my earlier analysis, it seems impossible to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Let me try to see if it's possible.

Suppose player 3 plays against player 1 and wins: p3 = 2, p1 = 0.

Then player 2 plays against player 1 and draws: p2 = 1, p1 = 1.

Now, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Total points: 4, which is even.

So, it's possible.

Wait, in this case, there is one win and one draw.

Total draws: 1.

But according to the program, it prints 2.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, the program prints p1 + p2 when p3 >= p1 + p2.

But in this case, p3 = 2, p1 + p2 = 2, so it prints 2.

But in my example, there is only one draw, contributing 2 points, and one win contributing 2 points, totaling 4 points.

But the program says 2 draws, but in reality, only one draw is possible.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect here.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

If there are two draws between different pairs, what happens?

Suppose player 1 and 2 draw: p1=1, p2=1.

Player 1 and 3 draw: p1=2, p3=1.

But p1 should be 1, but it becomes 2.

Not matching.

Alternatively, player 2 and 3 draw: p2=1, p3=1.

Then player 1 and 2 draw: p1=1, p2=2.

But p2 should be 1, not 2.

Not matching.

Another possibility: player 1 and 3 play twice.

First draw: p1=1, p3=1.

Second draw: p1=2, p3=2.

Now, p1=2, p3=2, p2=0.

Not matching p2=1.

Alternatively, player 1 and 2 play once, player 1 wins: p1=2, p2=0.

Player 2 and 3 play once, player 3 wins: p3=2, p2=0.

But p2 should be 1, not 0.

Not matching.

Another option: player 1 and 2 play once, draw: p1=1, p2=1.

Player 2 and 3 play once, draw: p2=2, p3=1.

Now, p1=1, p2=2, p3=1.

Not matching p3=2.

Wait, p3 should be 2, but in this case, p3=1.

Not matching.

Alternatively, player 1 and 3 play once, player 3 wins: p3=2, p1=0.

Player 1 and 2 play once, player 1 wins: p1=2, p2=0.

But p2 should be 1, not 0.

Not matching.

Another option: player 1 and 3 play once, player 3 wins: p3=2, p1=0.

Player 2 and 3 play once, draw: p2=1, p3=3.

But p3 should be 2, not 3.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

But according to the program, it prints 2.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me check another example.

Fifth example:

Input: 3 3 3

Sum is 9, which is odd, so impossible, output -1.

Sixth example:

Input: 3 4 5

Sum is 12, which is even.

p3 = 5, p1 + p2 = 7, so p3 >= p1 + p2 is false.

Then, low = min(5 - 3, 5 - 4) = min(2,1) =1

high = max(2,1) =2

cur starts at 1.

Check if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):

3 -1 <=4 - (5 -1) => 2 <=0, which is not true.

So, cur +=1 -> cur=2.

Check again:

3 -2 <=4 - (5 -2) =>1 <=1, which is true.

Then, print p1 - cur + p3 =3 -2 +5 =6.

Which matches the sample output.

Now, is this correct?

Let me see.

Total points: 12, so total games: 6.

To maximize draws, we need as many draws as possible.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total.

So, 6 draws would contribute 12 points.

But is this distribution possible?

If all 6 games are draws, involving various pairs, but ensuring p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Wait, if all games are draws, then each draw involves two players, each getting 1 point.

So, if there are 6 draws, total points would be 12, which matches.

But how to distribute them?

If player 1 and 2 draw three times: p1=3, p2=3.

Player 2 and 3 draw three times: p2=6, p3=3.

Total p1=3, p2=6, p3=3, which doesn't match p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Alternatively, player 1 and 3 draw three times: p1=3, p3=3.

Player 2 and 3 draw three times: p2=3, p3=6.

Total p1=3, p2=3, p3=6, not matching.

Another option: player 1 and 2 draw twice: p1=2, p2=2.

Player 2 and 3 draw twice: p2=4, p3=2.

Player 1 and 3 draw twice: p1=4, p3=4.

Total p1=4, p2=4, p3=4, which doesn't match p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Alternatively, player 1 and 2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

Player 2 and 3 draw three times: p2=4, p3=3.

Player 1 and 3 draw twice: p1=3, p3=5.

Total p1=3, p2=5, p3=5, which doesn't match p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Another try: player 1 and 2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

Player 2 and 3 draw twice: p2=3, p3=2.

Player 1 and 3 draw three times: p1=4, p3=5.

Total p1=4, p2=3, p3=5, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's not possible to achieve p1=3, p2=4, p3=5 with only draws.

Wait, but the program says 6 draws are possible.

But from my analysis, it seems impossible to achieve the required points with only draws.

Therefore, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider a combination of draws and wins.

Wait, but we are trying to maximize draws.

So, perhaps some wins are necessary to adjust the points.

Let me try.

Suppose there are 5 draws and 1 win.

Total points: 5*2 + 2*1 = 10 + 2 = 12, which matches.

Now, assign the wins and draws appropriately.

Suppose player 2 and 3 play once, player 3 wins: p3 +=2, p2 +=0.

Player 1 and 2 draw five times: p1 +=5, p2 +=5.

Total p1=5, p2=5, p3=2.

Doesn't match.

Another option: player 1 and 3 play once, player 3 wins: p3 +=2, p1 +=0.

Player 1 and 2 draw five times: p1 +=5, p2 +=5.

Total p1=5, p2=5, p3=2.

Not matching.

Alternatively, player 1 and 2 play once, player 1 wins: p1 +=2, p2 +=0.

Player 1 and 3 draw five times: p1 +=5, p3 +=5.

Total p1=7, p2=0, p3=5.

Not matching p2=4.

Another try: player 1 and 2 play once, draw: p1 +=1, p2 +=1.

Player 2 and 3 play once, win for player 3: p3 +=2, p2 +=0.

Player 1 and 3 play four times, draws: p1 +=4, p3 +=4.

Total p1=5, p2=1, p3=6.

Not matching.

Another attempt: player 1 and 2 play twice, draws: p1 +=2, p2 +=2.

Player 2 and 3 play once, win for player 3: p3 +=2, p2 +=0.

Player 1 and 3 play three times, draws: p1 +=3, p3 +=3.

Total p1=5, p2=2, p3=5.
