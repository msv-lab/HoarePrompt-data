Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting the array into two parts—a prefix and a suffix—and swapping these parts. The function should output "Yes" if it's possible and "No" otherwise.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The operation allowed is to split the array into two parts, x and y, such that a = x + y, and then swap them to make a = y + x. This operation can be performed any number of times. The goal is to check if, after some sequence of such operations, the array becomes sorted in non-decreasing order.

Let me think about what this operation really does. Splitting the array into x and y and swapping them is essentially rotating the array. For example, if we have an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and we split it into x=[1, 2] and y=[3, 4, 5], swapping gives us [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]. If we do this again, splitting into x=[3, 4] and y=[5, 1, 2], swapping gives [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], and so on.

So, this operation is similar to rotating the array by a certain number of positions. Since we can perform this operation multiple times, it's equivalent to being able to rotate the array any number of times.

Now, the question reduces to whether we can sort the array in non-decreasing order by rotating it any number of times.

But wait, sorting by rotations is not straightforward because rotations don't necessarily order the elements. For example, rotating [3, 1, 2] won't make it sorted because no matter how many rotations you perform, you can't arrange it in non-decreasing order without changing the elements' positions in a way that rotations don't allow.

However, there's a specific case where rotations can achieve a sorted array: when the array is a rotation of a sorted array. In other words, if the array is already sorted or can be sorted by rotating it, then the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, it's "No".

But let's verify this with the example provided in the problem description.

In the first test case:

6

1 1 4 5 1 4

The output is "No", meaning that no matter how many rotations are performed, the array cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order.

In the second test case:

5

7 9 2 2 3

By performing rotations, we can achieve a sorted array as explained in the note.

In the third test case:

3

1 2 3

It's already sorted, so the answer is "Yes".

So, the key here is to check if the array is a rotation of a sorted array.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it correctly implements this logic.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_2 reads the input and calls func_1 for each test case, collecting the results and printing them.

The main logic seems to be in func_1.

Let's analyze func_1:

def func_1(a):

n = len(a)

sorted_a = sorted(a)

concatenated_a = a + a

for i in range(n):

if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:

return 'Yes'

return 'No'

So, what this function does is:

1. Sort the array a to get sorted_a.

2. Concatenate a with itself to get concatenated_a.

3. Check if sorted_a is a substring (continuous subarray) of concatenated_a.

If it is, return "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

This seems to be checking if sorted_a is a rotation of a.

Wait, but in the problem, we can perform multiple rotations. Does this affect the correctness?

Let me think about this.

If we can perform rotations any number of times, and rotations correspond to rearranging the array in a circular manner, then checking if sorted_a is a rotation of a should be sufficient.

Because any rotation can be achieved by a sequence of the allowed operations (split and swap).

So, if sorted_a is a rotation of a, then it's possible to reach it through such operations.

Hence, this seems correct.

But let's verify with the examples.

First test case:

a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]

sorted_a = [1, 1, 4, 4, 5]

concatenated_a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]

Checking if [1, 1, 4, 4, 5] is a substring:

Looking at concatenated_a:

Indices 0 to 4: [1, 1, 4, 5, 1] ≠ sorted_a

Indices 1 to 5: [1, 4, 5, 1, 4] ≠ sorted_a

Indices 2 to 6: [4, 5, 1, 4, 1] ≠ sorted_a

Indices 3 to 7: [5, 1, 4, 1, 1] ≠ sorted_a

Indices 4 to 8: [1, 4, 1, 1, 4] ≠ sorted_a

Indices 5 to 9: [4, 1, 1, 4, 5] ≠ sorted_a

So, sorted_a is not a substring, hence "No", which matches the expected output.

Second test case:

a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3]

sorted_a = [2, 2, 3, 7, 9]

concatenated_a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]

Checking if [2, 2, 3, 7, 9] is a substring:

Indices 2 to 6: [2, 2, 3, 7, 9] == sorted_a

Hence, "Yes", which matches the expected output.

Third test case:

a = [1, 2, 3]

sorted_a = [1, 2, 3]

concatenated_a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

Indices 0 to 2: [1, 2, 3] == sorted_a

Hence, "Yes", which matches the expected output.

So, based on these examples, the program seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's think about other potential cases.

Consider an array that is already sorted:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4]

sorted_a = [1, 2, 3, 4]

concatenated_a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Indices 0 to 3: [1, 2, 3, 4] == sorted_a

Hence, "Yes"

Another case:

a = [4, 1, 2, 3]

sorted_a = [1, 2, 3, 4]

concatenated_a = [4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3]

Indices 1 to 4: [1, 2, 3, 4] == sorted_a

Hence, "Yes"

A case where it's not possible:

a = [1, 3, 2]

sorted_a = [1, 2, 3]

concatenated_a = [1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2]

Looking for [1, 2, 3]:

Indices 0 to 2: [1, 3, 2] ≠ sorted_a

Indices 1 to 3: [3, 2, 1] ≠ sorted_a

Indices 2 to 4: [2, 1, 3] ≠ sorted_a

Hence, "No", which is correct.

Another case:

a = [2, 2, 1, 1]

sorted_a = [1, 1, 2, 2]

concatenated_a = [2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1]

Looking for [1, 1, 2, 2]:

Indices 2 to 5: [1, 1, 2, 2] == sorted_a

Hence, "Yes"

Edge case with duplicate elements:

a = [3, 3, 3]

sorted_a = [3, 3, 3]

concatenated_a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Any substring of length 3 is [3, 3, 3], which matches sorted_a

Hence, "Yes"

Another edge case:

a = [1, 2]

sorted_a = [1, 2]

concatenated_a = [1, 2, 1, 2]

Indices 0 to 1: [1, 2] == sorted_a

Hence, "Yes"

And:

a = [2, 1]

sorted_a = [1, 2]

concatenated_a = [2, 1, 2, 1]

Indices 1 to 2: [1, 2] == sorted_a

Hence, "Yes"

Seems correct.

Wait, but according to the problem description, in the first test case, it's "No", which matches our earlier check.

I think the program is correctly implementing the logic to check if the array can be sorted by rotations, which aligns with the problem's allowed operations.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]
