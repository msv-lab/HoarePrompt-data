Alright, I've been assigned this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to handle multiple test cases, each involving three integers representing the scores of three friends after playing a series of chess games under specific rules. The goal is to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given these scores, or to output -1 if such scores are impossible.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. There are three players, and in each game, two of them play against each other. The possible outcomes are:

- One player wins and gets 2 points, the other gets 0.

- The game is a draw, and both players get 1 point.

The same pair can play multiple times, and it's even possible that no games were played at all.

Given the final scores p1, p2, p3 (with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3), I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have occurred.

The program provided is:

```

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):

        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:

            print(-1)

            continue

        x = (a + b + c) // 2

        y = a + b

        print(min(x, y))

```

I need to verify if this program correctly computes the maximum number of draws for any valid input according to the problem description.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. It reads the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case, it reads three integers a, b, c.

3. If the sum of a, b, and c is odd, it prints -1, indicating that such scores are impossible.

4. Otherwise, it calculates x as half of the sum of a, b, and c.

5. It calculates y as the sum of a and b.

6. It prints the minimum of x and y.

I need to verify if this logic correctly determines the maximum number of draws or if it incorrectly accepts or rejects certain cases.

First, let's consider the condition where the sum of the scores is odd.

According to the problem, in each game, the total points distributed are either 2 (in case of a win: 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser) or 2 (in case of a draw: 1 to each player). So, in every game, exactly 2 points are distributed. Therefore, the total points across all games should always be even. Hence, if the sum of p1, p2, p3 is odd, it's impossible, and -1 should be printed. This seems correct.

Now, assuming the sum is even, the program calculates x as half of the sum, which would be the total number of games played, since each game distributes 2 points.

Then, it calculates y as the sum of a and b.

Finally, it prints the minimum of x and y.

I need to understand why it's taking the minimum of x and y.

Let me think about what y represents. y is the sum of a and b, which are the scores of the first two players.

In the context of the problem, we need to maximize the number of draws.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total sum (1 point to each player).

Each win contributes 2 points to the total sum (2 to the winner, 0 to the loser).

So, the total number of games is x = (a + b + c) // 2.

Now, to maximize the number of draws, we need to maximize the number of times both players in a game get 1 point each.

But we need to ensure that the individual scores can be achieved through some combination of wins and draws.

I suspect that y = a + b represents the total points scored by the first two players.

But I'm not sure why taking min(x, y) would give the maximum number of draws.

Let me consider some examples to verify this.

Example 1:

Input: 0 0 0

Output: 0

Explanation: No games were played, so no draws.

The program correctly outputs 0.

Example 2:

Input: 0 1 1

Output: 1

Explanation: One game between player 2 and 3, which ended in a draw.

Total points: 0,1,1.

The program correctly outputs 1.

Example 3:

Input: 1 1 1

Output: -1

Explanation: Total sum is 3, which is odd, so impossible.

The program correctly outputs -1.

Example 4:

Input: 1 1 2

Output: 2

Explanation: Not sure, let's calculate.

Total sum is 4, which is even. x = 2.

y = 1 + 1 = 2.

min(x, y) = 2.

But is it possible to have 2 draws with scores 1,1,2?

Let's see:

- If two games were played, both draws between different pairs, but that would require each pair to have at least one draw.

Wait, possible sequence:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 2, draw -> both get 1 point.

- Game 2: Player 1 vs Player 3, Player 3 wins -> Player 3 gets 2, Player 1 stays at 1.

Total scores: Player 1:1, Player 2:1, Player 3:2.

This matches the input.

Number of draws: 1 (since only one game was a draw).

But according to the program, it outputs 2.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the sequence above, only one game is a draw.

Wait, maybe there's another way to achieve the scores with more draws.

Alternative sequence:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 2, draw -> Player 1:1, Player 2:1.

- Game 2: Player 2 vs Player 3, draw -> Player 2:2, Player 3:1.

But this would result in scores: Player 1:1, Player 2:2, Player 3:1, which doesn't match the input (1,1,2).

Wait, unless we have:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 3, Player 3 wins -> Player 1:0, Player 3:2.

- Game 2: Player 2 vs Player 3, draw -> Player 2:1, Player 3:3.

But this results in 0,1,3, which doesn't match.

Alternatively:

- Game 1: Player 1 vs Player 2, draw -> Player 1:1, Player 2:1.

- Game 2: Player 1 vs Player 3, draw -> Player 1:2, Player 3:1.

- Game 3: Player 2 vs Player 3, Player 2 wins -> Player 2:3, Player 3:1.

But this results in 2,3,1, which doesn't match.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Looking back, perhaps it's impossible to achieve scores 1,1,2 with more than one draw.

In the first sequence I considered, there is only one draw resulting in scores 1,1,2.

But the program outputs 2, which seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe the program is counting something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me look at the total points.

Total points: 1+1+2=4.

Number of games: x=4/2=2.

y=a+b=1+1=2.

min(x,y)=2.

But in reality, only one draw can occur in a sequence that results in scores 1,1,2.

Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**.

I have found at least one case where the program gives an incorrect output.

Hence, I can conclude that the program is not correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
