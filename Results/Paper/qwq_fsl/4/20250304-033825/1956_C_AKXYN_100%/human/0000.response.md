Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program is correct, I need to print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. I need to ensure that the program meets the requirements for every potential case as per the problem description.

Let's first understand the problem and the program provided.

### Problem Description

Nene has an n x n matrix filled with zeroes. She can perform two types of operations:

1. **Type 1 operation**: Choose a row i and a permutation p of integers from 1 to n. Assign the values of p to the cells in row i.

2. **Type 2 operation**: Choose a column i and a permutation p of integers from 1 to n. Assign the values of p to the cells in column i.

The goal is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix using no more than 2n operations.

### Program Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The matrix `mat` is initialized with rows containing numbers from 1 to n.
   - `res` is calculated using a formula that seems to aim at maximizing the sum.

2. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `n << 1` (which is equivalent to `2 * n`).
   - Then, it prints sequences of operations: for each row and column from n to 1, it performs a Type 1 and Type 2 operation, assigning the permutation [1, 2, ..., n] each time.

### Potential Issues

1. **Permutation Assignment**:
   - The program always assigns the permutation [1, 2, ..., n] to both rows and columns.
   - However, the problem allows any permutation of [1, 2, ..., n] for each operation.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum `res` is calculated using `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which might not correctly represent the maximum possible sum.

3. **Operation Sequence**:
   - Performing operations on rows and columns in a specific order might lead to overwriting some cells, potentially reducing the sum.

### Example Verification

Let's consider the example provided in the problem:

**Input:**

```

2

1

2

```

**Expected Output:**

```

1 1

1 1

7 3

1 1 1 2

1 2 1 2

2 1 1 2

```

**Program's Output:**

For n=1:

- Sum: 1, Operations: 2 (which is 1 << 1)

- Operations: Type 1 on row 1, assign [1], Type 2 on column 1, assign [1]

This seems correct as the sum is 1.

For n=2:

- Sum: calculated as (1)*(3) + (2)*(5) = 3 + 10 = 13, but the expected sum is 7.

- Operations: Type 1 on row 2, assign [1,2], Type 2 on column 2, assign [1,2], Type 1 on row 1, assign [1,2], Type 2 on column 1, assign [1,2]

But in the example, the sum is 7 with 3 operations.

This indicates a discrepancy in the sum calculation.

### Conclusion

The program seems to have issues with correctly calculating the maximum sum and the sequence of operations. Specifically, for n=2, the calculated sum is 13, but the example shows a sum of 7 with a different operation sequence.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
