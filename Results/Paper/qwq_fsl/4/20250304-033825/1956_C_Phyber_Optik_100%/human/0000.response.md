Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix using specific operations, and it needs to do this within a certain number of operations. My job is to determine if the provided program correctly achieves this goal for all possible inputs, given the constraints.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The problem involves a matrix filled with zeros initially, and we can perform two types of operations on it:

1. Type 1 operation: Choose a row i and a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n, and assign the elements of row i to be the permutation p.

2. Type 2 operation: Choose a column i and a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n, and assign the elements of column i to be the permutation p, but assigned to a_{j, i} for all j.

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than 2n operations.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to read the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n, calculates some sum, prints the sum and the number of operations, and then prints the operations.

Let me try to understand what the program is doing.

In the function `func()`, it reads the number of test cases `t`, and then for each test case, it reads `n`. Then it calculates a sum in a loop from 1 to n, where for each i from 2 to n, it adds (i*i - (i-1)*(i-1)) * i to the sum. This seems a bit convoluted. Let's see what this sum represents.

Wait a minute, the sum starts at 1 (for i=1), and then for each i from 2 to n, it adds (i*i - (i-1)*(i-1)) * i. Let's simplify this.

(i*i - (i-1)*(i-1)) simplifies to (i*i - (i*i - 2i + 1)) = 2i - 1.

So, the addition for each i is (2i - 1) * i = 2i^2 - i.

Therefore, the total sum is 1 + sum_{i=2 to n} (2i^2 - i).

But wait, for i=1, sum starts at 1, which is 2*(1)^2 - 1 = 1, so it's consistent.

So, sum = sum_{i=1 to n} (2i^2 - i).

This can be simplified further:

sum = 2*sum(i^2) - sum(i) for i from 1 to n.

We know that sum(i^2) from 1 to n is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6, and sum(i) is n(n+1)/2.

So, sum = 2*[n(n+1)(2n+1)/6] - [n(n+1)/2]

= [n(n+1)(2n+1)/3] - [n(n+1)/2]

= n(n+1)/2 * [(2n+1)/3 - 1]

= n(n+1)/2 * [(2n+1 - 3)/3]

= n(n+1)/2 * [(2n - 2)/3]

= n(n+1)/2 * [2(n - 1)/3]

= n(n+1)(n - 1)/3

But let's check if this makes sense.

Take n=1: sum should be 1, as per the program.

sum = 1*(1+1)*(1-1)/3 = 0, which is not 1. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the simplification.

Let me recalculate sum = sum_{i=1 to n} (2i^2 - i)

= 2*sum(i^2) - sum(i)

= 2*(n(n+1)(2n+1)/6) - n(n+1)/2

= n(n+1)(2n+1)/3 - n(n+1)/2

= n(n+1)/1 * [ (2n+1)/3 - 1/2 ]

= n(n+1)/1 * [ (4n + 2 - 3)/6 ]

= n(n+1)/1 * (4n -1)/6

= n(n+1)(4n -1)/6

Wait, but for n=1: 1*2*3/6 = 1, which matches the program's sum for n=1.

For n=2: 2*3*7/6 = 42/6=7, which matches the example output.

So, the sum is n(n+1)(4n -1)/6.

But in the program, it's calculating it differently, but it seems to be arriving at the correct sum.

Now, the program prints this sum and then prints m=2n operations.

Then, it prints m operations, where for j from 1 to n:

- It prints a type 1 operation for row (n - j + 1) with permutation 1 to n.

- Then a type 2 operation for column (n - j + 1) with permutation 1 to n.

So, it's performing operations on rows and columns in a specific order.

But I need to verify if this sequence of operations indeed maximizes the sum of the matrix.

Let me think about how the operations affect the matrix.

Each type 1 operation sets a entire row to a permutation of 1 to n.

Each type 2 operation sets a entire column to a permutation of 1 to n.

But since the matrix is initially zero, and operations can be performed in any order, we need to see if the sequence of operations in the program achieves the maximum possible sum.

Wait, but operations can overwrite each other. For example, if a type 1 operation sets a row, and then a type 2 operation sets some elements of that row again through column operations.

So, the final value of a cell a_{i,j} depends on the last operation that set it.

Therefore, to maximize the sum, we need to set each cell to the highest possible value, considering the operations performed.

But since type 1 operations set rows and type 2 operations set columns, and operations can overwrite each other, we need to find a sequence of operations that maximizes the sum.

Looking at the example in the problem:

For n=2:

Operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1 with permutation [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2 with permutation [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1 with permutation [1,2]

After operation 1: a = [[1,2],[0,0]]

After operation 2: a = [[1,2],[1,2]]

After operation 3: a = [[1,2],[1,2]] (since column 1 is set to [1,2], which overwrites the first element of row 2 to 1.

Wait, but in the note, it says the sum is 7, which is 1+2+1+3, but in this case, it's 1+2+1+2=6.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the example output, it's:

7 3

1 1 1 2

1 2 1 2

2 1 1 2

So, operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]

2. Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]

3. Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2]

After operation 1: a = [[1,2],[0,0]]

After operation 2: a = [[1,2],[1,2]]

After operation 3: a = [[1,2],[1,2]]

Sum is 1+2+1+2=6, but the note says it's 7. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the operations are being interpreted differently.

Wait, perhaps in type 2 operations, when setting column i to permutation p, it sets a_{j,i} = p_j for all j.

So, for operation 3: type 2, column 1, permutation [1,2]

This sets a_{1,1} = 1 and a_{2,1} = 2.

So, after operation 1: a = [[1,2],[0,0]]

After operation 2: a = [[1,2],[1,2]]

After operation 3: a = [[1,2],[2,2]]

Because a_{1,1} set to 1 and a_{2,1} set to 2.

So, sum is 1+2+2+2=7, which matches.

Got it.

So, operations can overwrite previous assignments.

Now, the question is, does the provided program achieve the maximum sum for all n?

Looking at the program, it performs n type 1 operations on rows from n to 1, each with permutation [1,2,3,...,n], and n type 2 operations on columns from n to 1, each with permutation [1,2,3,...,n].

Wait, no, in the code, it's:

for j in range(1, n + 1):

print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))

print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))

So, it's performing type 1 operations on rows from n down to 1, each with permutation [1,2,3,...,n], and then type 2 operations on columns from n down to 1, each with permutation [1,2,3,...,n].

So, for n=2:

Operations:

1. Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]

2. Type 2 on row 2 with [1,2]

3. Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]

4. Type 2 on row 1 with [1,2]

Wait, no, looking back at the code:

print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))

print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))

So, for j=1, n -1 +1 = n, so type 1 on row n, type 2 on column n.

For j=2, n-2+1 = n-1, so type 1 on row n-1, type 2 on column n-1, and so on.

So, for n=2:

j=1: type 1 on row 2, type 2 on column 2

j=2: type 1 on row 1, type 2 on column 1

So, operations:

1. Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]

2. Type 2 on column 2 with [1,2]

3. Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]

4. Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2]

Wait, but in the example answer, it's only 3 operations: type 1 on row 1, type 1 on row 2, type 2 on column 1.

So, perhaps the program is doing more operations than necessary, but that's acceptable as long as it's within 2n operations.

Now, I need to see if this sequence of operations maximizes the sum of the matrix.

Let me try to see what the final matrix looks like after all these operations.

Starting with a zero matrix.

First operation: type 1 on row 2 with [1,2]

So, a = [[0,0],[1,2]]

Second operation: type 2 on column 2 with [1,2]

This sets a_{1,2}=2 and a_{2,2}=2

So, a = [[0,2],[1,2]]

Third operation: type 1 on row 1 with [1,2]

So, a = [[1,2],[1,2]]

Fourth operation: type 2 on column 1 with [1,2]

This sets a_{1,1}=1 and a_{2,1}=2

So, a = [[1,2],[2,2]]

Sum is 1+2+2+2=7, which matches the example.

So, for n=2, it works.

Let's see for n=1.

Operations:

1. Type 1 on row 1 with [1]

Then, sum is 1, which matches the example.

Now, does this generalizes for all n?

Let me think about n=3.

Operations:

1. Type 1 on row 3 with [1,2,3]

2. Type 2 on column 3 with [1,2,3]

3. Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2,3]

4. Type 2 on column 2 with [1,2,3]

5. Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2,3]

6. Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2,3]

Let's simulate this.

Start with a zero matrix.

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 3 with [1,2,3]

a = [

[0,0,0],

[0,0,0],

[1,2,3]

]

Operation 2: Type 2 on column 3 with [1,2,3]

Set a_{1,3}=1, a_{2,3}=2, a_{3,3}=3

a = [

[0,0,1],

[0,0,2],

[1,2,3]

]

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 2 with [1,2,3]

a = [

[0,0,1],

[1,2,3],

[1,2,3]

]

Operation 4: Type 2 on column 2 with [1,2,3]

Set a_{1,2}=1, a_{2,2}=2, a_{3,2}=3

a = [

[0,1,1],

[1,2,3],

[1,3,3]

]

Operation 5: Type 1 on row 1 with [1,2,3]

a = [

[1,2,3],

[1,2,3],

[1,3,3]

]

Operation 6: Type 2 on column 1 with [1,2,3]

Set a_{1,1}=1, a_{2,1}=2, a_{3,1}=3

a = [

[1,2,3],

[2,2,3],

[3,3,3]

]

Sum is 1+2+3 + 2+2+3 + 3+3+3 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 21

Is this the maximum sum?

Let's see what the program calculates for sum for n=3.

sum = 1 + sum_{i=2 to 3} (2i^2 - i)

= 1 + (2*4 - 2) + (2*9 - 3) = 1 + (8 - 2) + (18 - 3) = 1 + 6 + 15 = 22

But according to the simulation, sum is 21, which is less than 22.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect for n=3.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the simulation.

Let me check again.

After operation 1:

a = [

[0,0,0],

[0,0,0],

[1,2,3]

]

Operation 2: type 2 on column 3: set a_{1,3}=1, a_{2,3}=2, a_{3,3}=3

a = [

[0,0,1],

[0,0,2],

[1,2,3]

]

Operation 3: type 1 on row 2: set a_{2,1}=1, a_{2,2}=2, a_{2,3}=3

a = [

[0,0,1],

[1,2,3],

[1,2,3]

]

Operation 4: type 2 on column 2: set a_{1,2}=1, a_{2,2}=2, a_{3,2}=3

a = [

[0,1,1],

[1,2,3],

[1,3,3]

]

Operation 5: type 1 on row 1: set a_{1,1}=1, a_{1,2}=2, a_{1,3}=3

a = [

[1,2,3],

[1,2,3],

[1,3,3]

]

Operation 6: type 2 on column 1: set a_{1,1}=1, a_{2,1}=2, a_{3,1}=3

a = [

[1,2,3],

[2,2,3],

[3,3,3]

]

Sum: 1+2+3 + 2+2+3 + 3+3+3 = 21

But according to the formula sum = n(n+1)(4n -1)/6 for n=3: 3*4*11/6=132/6=22

So, there's a discrepancy here.

So, perhaps the program's sum calculation is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I messed up the sum formula.

Let me recalculate sum = sum_{i=1 to n} (2i^2 - i)

For n=3: sum = (2*1^2 -1) + (2*2^2 -2) + (2*3^2 -3) = (2-1) + (8-2) + (18-3) =1 +6 +15=22

But in the simulation, the sum is 21.

So, the program's sum calculation is correct, but the operations don't achieve that sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's acceptable as long as it achieves the maximum sum, not necessarily through the exact operations provided.

But the problem asks to provide a solution with no more than 2n operations, and it's guaranteed that it's possible to achieve the maximum sum in no more than 2n operations.

So, if the program doesn't achieve the maximum sum, it's incorrect.

Hence, in this case, for n=3, the program's operations result in a sum of 21, while the maximum possible sum is 22.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

But perhaps there's a way to achieve the sum of 22 with the given operations.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps by choosing different permutations, I can achieve a higher sum.

In the program, it always uses the permutation [1,2,3,...,n], but perhaps using different permutations can lead to a higher sum.

But according to the problem, p must be a permutation of 1 to n, so the sum is bounded by the values available.

Wait, but since we can choose any permutation for each operation, perhaps there's a better way to maximize the sum.

Let me think about it differently.

Each cell in the matrix can be set by multiple operations, but only the last operation that sets it will determine its final value.

So, to maximize the sum, we need to set each cell to the highest possible value, considering the operations performed.

But since rows and columns can overwrite each other, it's tricky.

Perhaps a better approach is to set all rows to [n,n-1,...,1] and all columns to [n,n-1,...,1], but I need to see.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the last operation on each cell determines its value.

So, if I set rows with higher values last, and columns with higher values last, perhaps that would help.

But it's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula to calculate the maximum sum without worrying about the operations.

Looking back, in the example for n=2, the sum is 7, which matches the program's output.

For n=1, sum is 1.

For n=3, according to the program, sum is 22.

But in my simulation, I only got 21.

So, perhaps there's a way to arrange operations to get 22.

Maybe I need to choose different permutations.

In the program, it always uses [1,2,3,...,n] for permutations, but perhaps using different permutations can lead to higher sums.

Wait, but since it's a permutation of 1 to n, the sum of any row or column is fixed at n(n+1)/2.

So, perhaps the issue is not with the permutations chosen, but with the way operations are ordered.

Wait, but operations can overwrite each other, so the order matters.

Maybe performing type 2 operations after type 1 operations can help set higher values in certain cells.

But it's getting too involved to think through.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that for n=3, the program achieves 21, but the maximum possible is 22, hence it's incorrect.

But in the example for n=2, it achieves the maximum sum of 7.

For n=1, it achieves the maximum sum of 1.

But for n=3, it falls short.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **False**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix using at most 2n operations, where each operation allows us to set the values of a entire row or column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

### Approach

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - We can perform two types of operations: setting a row or setting a column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
   - Our aim is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix.

2. **Insight**:
   - Each cell in the matrix can be set by operations on its row or column.
   - The final value of a cell depends on the last operation that sets it.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize the sum, prioritize setting higher values in cells that are set by the last operations.
   - One way is to set rows and columns in a specific order to ensure higher values are placed in cells that are set later.

4. **Implementation**:
   - For each test case, calculate the maximum possible sum using the formula derived from summing the series.
   - Output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        print(sum, 2 * n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum is calculated using the formula `sum = sum_{i=1 to n} (2i^2 - i)`, which simplifies to `n(n+1)(4n -1)/6`.
   - This formula ensures we achieve the maximum possible sum for the matrix.

2. **Operations**:
   - We perform `2n` operations: `n` type 1 operations and `n` type 2 operations.
   - Type 1 operations set rows from the last to the first with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].
   - Type 2 operations set columns from the last to the first with the same permutation.

3. **Optimal Ordering**:
   - By setting rows and columns in descending order, we ensure that higher values are placed in cells that are set later, maximizing the sum.

This approach ensures that the sum of the matrix is maximized within the constraints provided.
