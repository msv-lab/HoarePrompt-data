Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

After reviewing the provided program and the problem description, I have determined that the program is correct. The program aims to calculate the area of a square given its four corners in random order, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing four lines with coordinates (x, y).

The program structure is as follows:

1. Read the number of test cases, `n`.

2. For each test case:

a. Read four pairs of coordinates.

b. Sort the coordinates.

c. Calculate the squared distances between specific pairs of points.

d. Compute the area using these distances.

e. Print the rounded area.

Let's break down the logic:

### Sorting Coordinates

The coordinates are sorted, which is a crucial step. Sorting the coordinates ensures a consistent order, making it easier to identify the sides of the square.

### Distance Calculations

The program calculates the squared distances between specific pairs of points:

- `p1` is the squared distance between the first two points in the sorted list.

- `p2` is the squared distance between the last two points in the sorted list.

Given that the square has sides parallel to the axes, these pairs should represent the lengths of the sides.

### Area Calculation

The area is calculated by multiplying the square roots of `p1` and `p2` and then rounding the result. This approach assumes that `p1` and `p2` represent the squared lengths of the sides of the square.

### Correctness Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the properties of the square:

- All sides are equal.

- Angles are 90 degrees.

- Sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.

Given these properties, the sorted coordinates should arrange the points in a specific order, typically either ascending x then y, which would place the points in a predictable sequence like bottom-left, bottom-right, top-left, top-right.

### Example Analysis

Let's take the first example from the input:

```

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

```

After sorting:

- (1, 2)

- (1, 5)

- (4, 2)

- (4, 5)

Calculating `p1`:

- Between (1,2) and (1,5): distance squared is (1-1)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

Calculating `p2`:

- Between (4,2) and (4,5): distance squared is (4-4)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

Area:

- sqrt(9) * sqrt(9) = 3 * 3 = 9

Which matches the expected output.

Another example:

```

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

```

After sorting:

- (-1, -1)

- (-1, 1)

- (1, -1)

- (1, 1)

Calculating `p1`:

- Between (-1,-1) and (-1,1): distance squared is ( -1+1)^2 + (1+1)^2 = 0 + 4 = 4

Calculating `p2`:

- Between (1,-1) and (1,1): distance squared is (1-1)^2 + (1+1)^2 = 0 + 4 = 4

Area:

- sqrt(4) * sqrt(4) = 2 * 2 = 4

Which matches the expected output.

### General Case

In general, for any square with sides parallel to the axes, sorting the coordinates will group points with the same x-coordinates together, allowing the calculation of side lengths via squared distances as shown. The area calculation then correctly multiplies these side lengths.

### Edge Cases

Consider edge cases, such as squares with minimal side lengths (e.g., side length 1):

Input:

```

1

0 0

0 1

1 0

1 1

```

After sorting:

- (0,0)

- (0,1)

- (1,0)

- (1,1)

Calculating `p1`:

- Between (0,0) and (0,1): distance squared is 0 + 1 = 1

Calculating `p2`:

- Between (1,0) and (1,1): distance squared is 0 + 1 = 1

Area:

- sqrt(1) * sqrt(1) = 1 * 1 = 1

Which is correct.

Another edge case: points with negative coordinates:

Input:

```

1

-2 -2

-2 -3

-3 -2

-3 -3

```

After sorting:

- (-3, -3)

- (-3, -2)

- (-2, -3)

- (-2, -2)

Calculating `p1`:

- Between (-3,-3) and (-3,-2): distance squared is 0 + 1 = 1

Calculating `p2`:

- Between (-2,-3) and (-2,-2): distance squared is 0 + 1 = 1

Area:

- sqrt(1) * sqrt(1) = 1 * 1 = 1

Which is correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the area of a square given its coordinates, adhering to the problem constraints. It handles various cases, including those with negative coordinates and minimal side lengths, producing the expected results. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**
