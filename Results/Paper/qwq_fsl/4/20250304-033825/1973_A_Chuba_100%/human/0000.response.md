Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. I need to determine if the program meets the requirements for every potential case. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I have to be thorough and consider all possible scenarios, including edge cases.

First, I need to understand the problem description completely. Let's read it again carefully.

We have three friends playing chess games together. In each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. The same pair can play multiple times, including zero times, and it's possible that no games were played at all.

After all the games, their scores are p1, p2, p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or print -1 if such scores are impossible.

So, the input is multiple test cases, each with three integers p1, p2, p3, sorted in non-decreasing order. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30.

The output should be, for each test case, the maximum number of draws possible, or -1 if the scores are invalid.

Looking at the examples provided:

1. 0 0 0: No games were played, so no draws, answer is 0.

2. 0 1 1: One game between player 2 and 3 resulting in a draw, so one draw.

3. 1 1 1: The output is -1, meaning it's impossible to have scores like this.

4. 1 1 2: Two draws possible.

5. 3 3 3: Impossible, so -1.

6. 3 4 5: Six draws possible.

7. 1 1 10: Two draws possible.

I need to understand why some scores are impossible and others are possible.

Let's think about the total points distributed. In each game, if there is a winner and a loser, total points awarded are 2 (winner gets 2, loser gets 0). If it's a draw, total points awarded are 2 (each gets 1).

So, regardless of whether the game ends in a draw or not, total points increase by 2 for each game played.

Therefore, the sum of all players' points should always be equal to twice the number of games played.

Let’s denote the total number of games played as G. Then, total points = 2G.

Given that p1 + p2 + p3 = 2G, so the sum must be even. If it's odd, it's impossible, hence -1.

Looking back at the examples:

- 0 0 0: Sum is 0, which is even, G=0, draws can be 0.

- 0 1 1: Sum is 2, G=1, draws can be 1.

- 1 1 1: Sum is 3, which is odd, impossible, so -1.

- 1 1 2: Sum is 4, G=2, draws can be 2.

- 3 3 3: Sum is 9, which is odd, impossible, so -1.

- 3 4 5: Sum is 12, G=6, draws can be 6.

- 1 1 10: Sum is 12, G=6, draws can be 2.

Wait, in the last case, sum is 12, G=6. But how can draws be only 2? Let's think about it.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total, just like a win/loss game. But in draws, both players get 1 point each.

To maximize the number of draws, we need to maximize the number of games that ended in draws, given the final scores.

But we need to ensure that the individual scores can be achieved through some combination of wins and draws.

Let me try to model this.

Let's denote:

- Let’s consider all possible pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).

- Each pair can play multiple games.

- For each game between a pair, it can be a win for one player or a draw.

- We need to assign the outcomes such that the total points match p1, p2, p3.

Our goal is to maximize the number of draws, given that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

First, I need to check if the total sum is even. If not, it's impossible, so -1.

Second, I need to see if there's a way to distribute the wins and draws among the pairs to achieve the individual scores.

Third, among all possible ways, find the one with the maximum number of draws.

Looking at the provided program:

```

import sys

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):

        v = list(map(int, input().split()))

        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:

            print('-1')

        else:

            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2

            print(result)

```

It seems to be calculating the maximum number of draws based on some formula.

Let me try to understand this formula.

First, it checks if the sum of p1, p2, p3 is odd. If yes, prints -1, which makes sense as total points must be even.

Otherwise, it computes:

result = (p1 + p2 + p3 - max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2

Wait, p3 - p1 - p2 could be negative, but since max(0, ...), it's zero or positive.

Let me see with some examples.

Example 1: 0 0 0

sum = 0, max(0, 0 - 0 - 0) = 0

result = (0 - 0) // 2 = 0, which matches.

Example 2: 0 1 1

sum = 2, max(0, 1 - 0 - 1) = max(0, 0) = 0

result = (2 - 0) // 2 = 1, which matches.

Example 3: 1 1 1

sum = 3, which is odd, so -1, correct.

Example 4: 1 1 2

sum = 4, max(0, 2 - 1 - 1) = max(0, 0) = 0

result = (4 - 0) // 2 = 2, which matches.

Example 5: 3 3 3

sum = 9, which is odd, so -1, correct.

Example 6: 3 4 5

sum = 12, max(0, 5 - 3 - 4) = max(0, -2) = 0

result = (12 - 0) // 2 = 6, which matches.

Example 7: 1 1 10

sum = 12, max(0, 10 - 1 - 1) = max(0, 8) = 8

result = (12 - 8) // 2 = (4) // 2 = 2, which matches.

So, in all the provided examples, this formula seems to work.

But is this formula always correct?

Let me try to understand the logic behind this formula.

First, total points = 2G, where G is the total number of games played.

The number of draws is what we need to maximize.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total, same as a win/loss game.

Wait, no. Each game, whether draw or not, contributes 2 points to the total.

So, the total number of games is G = (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2.

Our goal is to maximize the number of draws.

Let’s think in terms of minimizing the number of wins.

Wait, no, maximizing draws.

Each draw contributes 2 points divided among two players (1 each), while a win/loss game also contributes 2 points (2 for the winner, 0 for the loser).

But in terms of individual scores, a draw increases both players' scores by 1, while a win increases the winner's score by 2 and the loser's by 0.

Given that, to maximize draws, we need to maximize the number of games where both players get 1 point each, without violating the individual score constraints.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider that the total points are fixed, and we need to maximize the number of draws.

Wait, but the sum is always 2G, regardless of the number of draws.

So, perhaps the number of draws can be determined by something else.

Let me consider that in order to maximize draws, we need to minimize the number of wins.

Each win increases the winner's score by 2, while a draw increases both players' scores by 1.

So, for each player, their score is composed of wins and draws they were part of.

Let’s denote for each player:

- Let’s say w_i is the number of wins for player i.

- d_i is the number of draws for player i.

Then, their score is p_i = 2*w_i + d_i.

Because each win gives 2 points, and each draw gives 1 point.

Also, the total number of wins and draws should match the total number of games.

Wait, but each game is either a win for one player or a draw.

So, total games G = sum over all unique pairs of games played between them.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Given that, for each player, p_i = 2*w_i + d_i.

And we need to maximize the total number of draws, which is sum of d_i / 2, since each draw involves two players.

Wait, no, each draw is counted twice, once for each player.

So, total draws D = sum(d_i) / 2.

Our goal is to maximize D, given that sum(p_i) = sum(2*w_i + d_i) = 2*sum(w_i) + sum(d_i) = 2G.

Also, since each game is either a win or a draw, we have G = sum(w_i) + D.

From sum(p_i) = 2G, and G = sum(w_i) + D, we can write:

sum(p_i) = 2*(sum(w_i) + D) = 2G.

But sum(p_i) = 2*sum(w_i) + sum(d_i).

From G = sum(w_i) + D, and sum(d_i) = 2D, we have sum(p_i) = 2G.

So, sum(p_i) = 2*sum(w_i) + sum(d_i) = 2*(sum(w_i) + D) = 2G.

This seems consistent.

Our goal is to maximize D, given that p_i = 2*w_i + d_i for each player i.

Also, w_i >= 0 and d_i >= 0 for all i.

Additionally, the pairs playing against each other must be considered, but since any two can play, and the same pairs can play multiple times, perhaps we can ignore the pairing details and focus on the individual scores.

Wait, but we need to ensure that the w_i and d_i are consistent with some set of games between the pairs.

This seems complicated.

Let me look back at the provided formula:

result = (p1 + p2 + p3 - max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2

I need to see if this correctly calculates the maximum number of draws for any valid set of p1, p2, p3.

Let me consider some test cases.

Test case 1: 0 0 0

sum = 0, max(0, 0 - 0 - 0) = 0, result = (0 - 0) // 2 = 0, which is correct.

Test case 2: 0 1 1

sum = 2, max(0, 1 - 0 - 1) = max(0, 0) = 0, result = (2 - 0) // 2 = 1, which is correct.

Test case 3: 1 1 1

sum = 3, which is odd, so -1, correct.

Test case 4: 1 1 2

sum = 4, max(0, 2 - 1 - 1) = 0, result = (4 - 0) // 2 = 2.

Is this possible? Let's see.

Possible games:

- Suppose (1,2) draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- Suppose (1,3) draw once: p1=2, p3=2.

- But p1 is 1, p2 is 1, p3 is 2.

Wait, but p1 is 1, p2 is 1, p3 is 2.

Wait, maybe:

- (1,2) draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- (2,3) draw once: p2=2, p3=2.

- But p1 is 1, p2 is 2, p3 is 2, but we need p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively:

- (1,3) play once, player 3 wins: p3=2.

- (2,3) draw once: p2=1, p3=3.

But p3 is 3, which is more than required.

Alternatively:

- (1,2) draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- (2,3) play once, player 3 wins: p2=1, p3=2.

Total draws: 1.

But according to the formula, it's 2.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps multiple games between pairs.

- (1,2) draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- (2,3) draw once: p2=2, p3=2.

But we need p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

So, perhaps (1,2) draw once, and (2,3) draw once, but p2 becomes 2, which is more than required.

Wait, p2 is supposed to be 1, but in this case, it becomes 2.

Hmm.

Alternatively:

- (1,2) draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- (1,3) play once, player 3 wins: p1=1, p3=2.

Total draws: 1.

This matches p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

But according to the formula, it's 2.

Is there a way to have two draws and still achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2?

Let's try:

- (1,2) draw twice: p1=2, p2=2.

- (2,3) play once, player 2 loses: p2=2, p3=2.

But p1 is 2, which is more than required.

Alternatively:

- (1,2) draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- (1,3) draw once: p1=2, p3=2.

But p1 is 2, which is more than required.

Alternatively:

- (1,2) draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- (2,3) draw once: p2=2, p3=2.

But p2 is 2, which is more than required.

Wait, unless we have negative games, which is impossible.

So, it seems that only one draw is possible to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

But the formula gives 2.

Therefore, the formula seems incorrect in this case.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example output, for input 1 1 2, the output is 2.

But according to my reasoning, only one draw is possible.

Is there a way to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2 with two draws?

Let me think differently.

Suppose:

- (1,2) draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- (1,3) draw once: p1=2, p3=2.

- Then, p1=2, which is more than required.

Alternatively:

- (1,2) draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- (2,3) draw once: p2=2, p3=2.

- But p2=2, which is more than required.

Alternatively:

- (1,3) play once, player 3 wins: p3=2.

- (1,2) draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- Total draws: 1.

Again, only one draw.

It seems like two draws cannot be achieved without exceeding the required scores for p1 or p2.

Hence, the maximum number of draws is 1, but the formula gives 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

So, the correctness is False.

But wait, in the example answer, for input 1 1 2, the output is 2.

But according to my reasoning, it should be 1.

Is there a mistake in my reasoning?

Let me think again.

Suppose:

- (1,2) draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- (1,3) draw once: p1=2, p3=2.

But p1=2 is more than required.

- (2,3) draw once: p2=2, p3=3.

But p3=3 is more than required.

Alternatively:

- (1,2) draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- (2,3) play once, player 3 wins: p2=1, p3=2.

- Total draws: 1.

This matches p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Is there any way to have two draws and still achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2?

It seems impossible.

Hence, the formula is incorrect in this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
