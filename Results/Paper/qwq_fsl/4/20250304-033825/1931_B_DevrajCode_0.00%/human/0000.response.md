Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible input case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

Let's start by understanding the problem description and the provided program.

### Problem Description

There are `n` containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1 to `n`. Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the `i`-th container contains `a_i` units of water. The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

- Pour any amount of water from the `i`-th container to the `j`-th container, where `i < j`.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using this operation.

### Program Code

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
```

### Analysis

First, I need to understand what the program is doing and whether it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - It splits the input data into a list called `data`.
   - The first element of `data` is `n`, the number of containers.
   - The remaining elements are the amounts of water in each container, `a`.

2. **Function `func_1(n, a)`:**
   - It calculates the total water and checks if it's divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'No'.
   - It computes the target amount of water each container should have (`total_water // n`).
   - It iterates through each container, keeping a running sum (`container`) of the difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point this running sum becomes negative, it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the running sum going negative, it returns 'Yes'.

### Correctness Verification

To verify the correctness, I need to ensure that the program correctly determines whether it's possible to equalize the water in all containers using only the allowed operations (pouring water from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed one).

#### Key Insights

- **Sum Divisibility:** Since the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, the target amount is an integer.
- **Pouring Direction:** Water can only be poured from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed one. This imposes a constraint on the order in which we can adjust the water levels.

#### Approach Evaluation

The program's approach seems to be checking if the cumulative sum of differences from the target allows for the required adjustments without violating the pouring constraints.

Let's consider the cumulative sum of differences:

- For each container, `water - target` indicates how much water needs to be added (`positive`) or removed (`negative`).

- Since we can only pour water from lower to higher indices, the cumulative sum should not go negative because that would imply trying to remove more water than available from the previous containers.

This seems logically sound, but let's test it with some examples to confirm.

#### Test Cases

1. **Single Container:**
   - `n = 1`, `a = [43]`
   - Sum is 43, which is divisible by 1. The target is 43.
   - The program should return 'Yes'.

2. **Two Containers:**
   - `n = 2`, `a = [1, 3]`
   - Sum is 4, divisible by 2. Target is 2.
   - Differences: `-1`, `1`
   - Cumulative sum: `-1`, `0`
   - Since the cumulative sum goes negative, the program returns 'No'.

3. **Five Containers:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`
   - Sum is 15, divisible by 5. Target is 3.
   - Differences: `1`, `2`, `-1`, `-2`, `0`
   - Cumulative sums: `1`, `3`, `2`, `0`, `0`
   - No negative sums; should return 'Yes'.

4. **Three Containers:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = [1, 2, 3]`
   - Sum is 6, divisible by 3. Target is 2.
   - Differences: `-1`, `0`, `1`
   - Cumulative sums: `-1`, `-1`, `0`
   - Negative sum; should return 'No'.

5. **Seven Containers:**
   - `n = 7`, `a = [4, 5, 5, 0, 6, 4, 4]`
   - Sum is 28, divisible by 7. Target is 4.
   - Differences: `0`, `1`, `1`, `-4`, `2`, `0`, `0`
   - Cumulative sums: `0`, `1`, `2`, `-2`, `0`, `0`, `0`
   - Negative sum; should return 'No'.

6. **Seven Containers:**
   - `n = 7`, `a = [6, 5, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4]`
   - Sum is 28, divisible by 7. Target is 4.
   - Differences: `2`, `1`, `1`, `-3`, `-1`, `0`, `0`
   - Cumulative sums: `2`, `3`, `4`, `1`, `0`, `0`, `0`
   - No negative sums; should return 'Yes'.

Comparing these with the example output:

- Test case 1: YES
- Test case 2: NO
- Test case 3: YES
- Test case 4: NO
- Test case 5: NO
- Test case 6: YES

The program's output matches the example output.

#### Edge Cases

1. **All containers have the target amount:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = [2, 2, 2]`
   - Differences: `0`, `0`, `0`
   - Cumulative sums: `0`, `0`, `0`
   - Should return 'Yes'.

2. **One container needs to give water, others receive:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = [3, 1, 1]`
   - Target is `(3+1+1)/3 = 5/3` which is not integer, but since sum is divisible by n, it should be integer. Wait, sum is 5, which is not divisible by 3. But according to the problem, sum is always divisible by n, so this case shouldn't occur.

3. **Last container has more water:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = [1, 1, 3]`
   - Target is 5/3, but sum is 5, not divisible by 3. Invalid case per problem constraints.

4. **Containers with zero water:**
   - `n = 4`, `a = [4, 0, 4, 0]`
   - Sum is 8, divisible by 4. Target is 2.
   - Differences: `2`, `-2`, `2`, `-2`
   - Cumulative sums: `2`, `0`, `2`, `0`
   - No negative sums; should return 'Yes'.

5. **All containers have zero water:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Sum is 0, divisible by 5. Target is 0.
   - Differences: `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`
   - Cumulative sums: `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`
   - Should return 'Yes'.

6. **Large input sizes:**
   - `n = 2*10^5`, `a` with 2*10^5 elements.
   - The program should handle this efficiently since it's O(n) time complexity.

#### Potential Issues

1. **Overflow:**
   - Since `a_i` can be up to 10^9 and `n` up to 2*10^5, sum can be up to 2*10^14, which is within the range of Python's integers.

2. **Negative Differences:**
   - The program correctly handles negative differences by checking if the cumulative sum goes negative.

3. **Zero Sum:**
   - If sum is zero and n is greater than zero, target is zero. The program should work correctly in this case.

4. **Only one container:**
   - The program should handle n=1 correctly, as shown in the first test case.

5. **All containers same as target:**
   - As in edge case 1, the program should return 'Yes'.

6. **Cumulative sum刚好为零:**
   - If the cumulative sum reaches zero before the end, but subsequent differences are non-negative, it should still return 'Yes'.

#### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and testing it with various cases, including edge cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the allowed operations.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{True}}
