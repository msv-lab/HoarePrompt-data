Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix, swapping them, and concatenating them back.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. The problem states that we have an array `a` of length `n`, consisting of positive integers. The goal is to check if, by performing the described operation zero or more times, the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence.

The operation is defined as follows: split the array into two parts, a prefix `x` and a suffix `y`, such that `a = x + y`, and then swap these two parts to get `a := y + x`. For example, if `a = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`, we can choose `x = [3, 1]` and `y = [4, 1, 5]`, and after swapping, `a` becomes `[4, 1, 5, 3, 1]`.

I need to consider that this operation can be performed any number of times, and I have to determine if, after some sequence of such operations, the array can be made sorted in non-decreasing order.

Looking at the provided program, it seems that the function `func_1(a)` is responsible for checking this condition. Let's see how it approaches the problem.

In `func_1(a)`, the function first sorts the array `a` and stores it as `sorted_a`. Then, it creates a concatenated version of `a` with itself, `concatenated_a = a + a`. After that, it iterates through `concatenated_a` with a sliding window of size `n` (the length of `a`), checking if any substring of length `n` matches `sorted_a`. If it finds such a substring, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

Wait a minute, this seems familiar. It looks like the function is checking if the sorted version of `a` is a substring of `a + a`. If it is, then it's possible to achieve a sorted array by performing the specified operation some number of times.

But is this the correct approach? Let's think about it step by step.

First, the operation allows us to split the array into a prefix and a suffix, swap them, and concatenate them back. This operation is similar to rotating the array. For example, if we have `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and we choose `x = [1, 2]` and `y = [3, 4, 5]`, swapping them gives `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`, which is a rotation of the original array.

In general, performing this operation multiple times can be equivalent to rotating the array multiple times. In fact, any number of such operations can be seen as rotating the array by some positions.

Now, the question reduces to whether there exists a rotation of the array that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Wait, but the function `func_1(a)` is checking if the sorted array is a substring of `a + a`. This is a common technique to check if one array is a rotation of another.

Let me recall that for two arrays to be rotations of each other, one array can be obtained by rotating the other. To check this, we can concatenate one array to itself and check if the other array is a substring of this concatenated array.

In this case, since we're dealing with sorting, we're checking if the sorted version of `a` is a rotation of `a`.

But is this the correct way to approach the problem?

Let me consider an example to verify.

Take the first example from the problem:

Input:

3

6

1 1 4 5 1 4

5

7 9 2 2 3

3

1 2 3

Output:

No

Yes

Yes

Let's take the first test case: n=6, a=[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]

The sorted version would be [1, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1], but wait, no, sorted in non-decreasing order would be [1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5].

Wait, sorted_a should be [1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5].

Now, concatenated_a = a + a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]

Now, we check if [1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5] is a substring of concatenated_a.

Looking at concatenated_a:

Positions:

0: [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]

1: [1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1]

2: [4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1]

3: [5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4]

4: [1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5]

5: [4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1]

None of these match [1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5], so the function would return 'No', which matches the sample output.

Second test case: n=5, a=[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]

sorted_a = [2, 2, 3, 7, 9]

concatenated_a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]

Checking substrings:

0: [7, 9, 2, 2, 3]

1: [9, 2, 2, 3, 7]

2: [2, 2, 3, 7, 9] — this matches sorted_a

So, the function would return 'Yes', which matches the sample output.

Third test case: n=3, a=[1, 2, 3]

sorted_a = [1, 2, 3]

concatenated_a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

Checking substrings:

0: [1, 2, 3]

1: [2, 3, 1]

2: [3, 1, 2]

The first one matches sorted_a, so it returns 'Yes', matching the sample output.

So, in these cases, the function seems to work correctly.

But is this approach always correct? Let's think about potential edge cases.

Consider an array that is already sorted: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

sorted_a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

concatenated_a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Clearly, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is a substring, so it returns 'Yes', which is correct.

Another case: a = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]

sorted_a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

concatenated_a = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Checking substrings:

0: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]

1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] — matches sorted_a

So, returns 'Yes', which is correct because rotating once gives the sorted array.

Another case: a = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

sorted_a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

concatenated_a = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

Checking substrings:

0: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

1: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

2: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]

3: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] — matches sorted_a

So, returns 'Yes'.

Seems correct so far.

Let's think about an array that cannot be sorted by any rotation.

For example, a = [1, 3, 2]

sorted_a = [1, 2, 3]

concatenated_a = [1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2]

Checking substrings:

0: [1, 3, 2]

1: [3, 2, 1]

2: [2, 1, 3]

None match [1, 2, 3], so returns 'No', which is correct.

Another example: a = [2, 2, 1, 2]

sorted_a = [1, 2, 2, 2]

concatenated_a = [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2]

Checking substrings:

0: [2, 2, 1, 2]

1: [2, 1, 2, 2]

2: [1, 2, 2, 2] — matches sorted_a

So, returns 'Yes', which is correct.

Wait, but is there a case where the function might return 'Yes' when it's actually not possible to sort the array through the allowed operations?

Wait a minute, the operation is to split into a prefix and a suffix, swap them, and concatenate. But is this operation equivalent to any rotation?

Let's consider what operations are allowed.

Given a = x + y, we can set a := y + x.

This is exactly a rotation by the length of x.

So, performing this operation multiple times allows us to perform multiple rotations.

In fact, any rotation can be achieved by performing this operation multiple times.

Wait, is that true?

Let's see.

Suppose we have a = [a, b, c, d].

One operation: choose x = [a], y = [b, c, d], swap to get [b, c, d, a].

Another operation: choose x = [b], y = [c, d, a], swap to get [c, d, a, b].

Another operation: choose x = [c], y = [d, a, b], swap to get [d, a, b, c].

Another operation: choose x = [d], y = [a, b, c], swap to get [a, b, c, d].

So, we can rotate the array by one position at a time.

Therefore, we can achieve any rotation by performing this operation multiple times.

Hence, the problem reduces to checking if there exists a rotation of the array that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The function `func_1(a)` seems to correctly implement this by checking if the sorted array is a substring of `a + a`.

I can't think of any counterexamples where this approach would fail.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
