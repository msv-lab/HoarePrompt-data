Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix using a series of operations, and I need to determine if the provided program achieves this correctly.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The problem involves an n x n matrix initially filled with zeros. There are two types of operations that can be performed on this matrix:

1. Type 1 operation: Choose a row i and a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n. Then, set the elements of the i-th row to the values in p.

2. Type 2 operation: Choose a column i and a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n. Then, set the elements of the i-th column to the values in p.

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than 2n operations.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be generating a specific sequence of operations for any given n. Specifically, for each row and each column, it applies operations that set the row or column to a decreasing sequence from n to 1.

Here's the program for reference:

```

t = int(input())

for t in range(t, 0, -1):

    func_1()

def func_1():

    n = int(input())

    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)

    for i in range(1, n + 1):

        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))

        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))

```

So, for each test case, it reads n, calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations, and then prints a series of operations.

I need to verify if this program correctly maximizes the sum of the matrix for any given n.

First, let's understand what the program is doing.

1. It calculates the maximum sum as n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6.

2. It sets the number of operations to 2 * n.

3. For each row i from 1 to n:

- It performs a Type 1 operation setting the i-th row to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

- It performs a Type 2 operation setting the i-th column to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

I need to verify if this approach indeed maximizes the sum of the matrix.

Let's consider a small value of n to see what's happening.

Take n = 1:

- Matrix is 1x1.

- Operations:

- Type 1: Set row 1 to [1].

- Type 2: Set column 1 to [1].

- But since the matrix is 1x1, both operations effectively set the single element to 1.

- Sum is 1, which is correct.

Now, n = 2:

- Matrix is 2x2.

- Operations:

- Type 1 on row 1: set row 1 to [2, 1].

- Type 2 on column 1: set column 1 to [2, 1].

- Type 1 on row 2: set row 2 to [2, 1].

- Type 2 on column 2: set column 2 to [2, 1].

Let's simulate this step by step.

Initial matrix:

0 0

0 0

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1, set to [2, 1].

Matrix:

2 1

0 0

Operation 2: Type 2 on column 1, set to [2, 1].

Matrix:

2 1

1 0

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 2, set to [2, 1].

Matrix:

2 1

2 0

Operation 4: Type 2 on column 2, set to [2, 1].

Matrix:

2 2

2 1

Sum: 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7.

According to the example in the problem description, for n=2, the maximum sum is 7, which matches.

Another test case: n=3.

Let's simulate:

Initial matrix:

0 0 0

0 0 0

0 0 0

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1, set to [3, 2, 1].

Matrix:

Operation 3: Type 1 on row 2, set to [3, 2, 1].

Matrix:

Operation 4: Type 2 on column 2, set to [3, 2, 1].

Matrix:

Operation 5: Type 1 on row 3, set to [3, 2, 1].

Matrix:

3 3 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Operation 6: Type 2 on column 3, set to [3, 2, 1].

Matrix:

3 3 3

3 2 2

3 2 1

Sum: 3+3+3 + 3+2+2 + 3+2+1 = 9 + 7 + 6 = 22.

Is this the maximum possible sum?

Let me try to calculate the theoretical maximum.

Each operation sets a row or column to a permutation of 1 to n, and we can do up to 2n operations.

But we need to maximize the sum of all elements.

Each operation on a row or column can overwrite previous operations on those rows and columns.

I need to think about how to maximize the sum.

An alternative approach: assign the highest possible values to as many matrix elements as possible.

But since operations can overwrite each other, we need to be careful.

The provided program seems to be setting rows and columns alternately, using the same permutation each time.

In the n=2 case, the sum is 7, which matches the example.

In the n=3 case, the sum is 22.

Is 22 the maximum for n=3?

Let me try to see if I can get a higher sum.

Alternative approach:

- Perform type 1 operations on all rows, setting them to [3,2,1].

Matrix:

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Sum: 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27.

Wait, but according to the program, for n=3, it gives a sum of 22, but manually setting all rows to [3,2,1] gives a sum of 27, which is higher.

But according to the program, it's printing sum as n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6.

For n=3:

n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6 = 3 * 4 * 11 // 6 = 132 // 6 = 22.

But according to my manual calculation, 27 is higher than 22.

This suggests that the program is incorrect because it's not achieving the maximum possible sum.

Wait, but in the n=2 case, it gives 7, which matches the example.

For n=1, sum is 1, which is correct.

For n=2, sum is 7, which matches the example.

For n=3, manual calculation gives 27, but the program says 22.

Is there a mistake in my manual calculation?

Wait, perhaps performing type 1 operations on all rows is sufficient to achieve the maximum sum.

Let me check the constraints: we can perform up to 2n operations.

For n=3, up to 6 operations.

In the manual approach, setting all rows to [3,2,1] using 3 type 1 operations gives sum 27.

But according to the program, it's using 6 operations (2n=6) and achieving sum 22, which is less than 27.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it doesn't achieve the maximum possible sum.

Wait, but perhaps there's a reason why the program is doing both row and column operations.

Maybe there are cases where using both row and column operations is better.

Let me think about n=2.

In n=2, the program achieves sum 7, which matches the example.

In n=1, sum is 1.

In n=2, sum is 7.

In n=3, manual calculation suggests 27 is possible, but the program achieves 22.

So, perhaps for n=3, 27 is indeed possible, making the program incorrect.

Wait, but maybe there's a conflict in operations.

Wait, in the manual approach, setting all rows to [3,2,1] gives sum 27, using only 3 operations, which is within the limit of 6 operations.

Therefore, the program should use only type 1 operations on all rows to achieve sum 27.

But the program is doing both type 1 and type 2 operations, achieving a lower sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

But perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me check the formula used in the program: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6.

For n=1: 1*2*3//6=6//6=1, correct.

For n=2: 2*3*7//6=42//6=7, correct.

For n=3: 3*4*11//6=132//6=22, but manual calculation suggests 27 is possible, which is higher.

Therefore, either the formula is incorrect or my manual calculation is wrong.

Perhaps I need to verify the formula.

Let me see: what's the maximum possible sum?

Each element in the matrix can be set to any value from 1 to n, but through operations that set entire rows or columns.

Each operation sets a row or column to a permutation of 1 to n, meaning each row or column can be set to any arrangement of 1 to n.

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements.

Given that, the optimal strategy seems to set as many rows as possible to [n, n-1, ..., 1], which would give the highest possible sum.

In the n=3 case, setting all three rows to [3,2,1] gives sum 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 + 3+2+1 = 9*3=27.

This seems better than the program's sum of 22.

But perhaps there's a constraint I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps operations can overwrite previous operations.

If I set a row and then set a column, the column operation will overwrite the values in that column for all rows.

In the program's approach, for n=3:

- Set row 1 to [3,2,1].

- Set column 1 to [3,2,1].

- Set row 2 to [3,2,1].

- Set column 2 to [3,2,1].

- Set row 3 to [3,2,1].

- Set column 3 to [3,2,1].

Resulting matrix:

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 1 1

Sum: 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+1+1 = 9 + 6 + 3 = 18.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 22.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the earlier simulation for n=3, I had:

After all operations:

3 3 3

3 2 2

3 2 1

Sum: 3+3+3 + 3+2+2 + 3+2+1 = 9 + 7 + 6 = 22.

Ah, I see, I must have made a mistake in the earlier simulation.

So, sum is indeed 22.

But is there a way to get higher than 22?

Let me try to see.

If I set all rows to [3,2,1], sum is 27.

But when I set columns afterwards, some values get overwritten.

In the program's approach, setting columns to [3,2,1] overwrites some row values.

Wait, perhaps there's a better sequence of operations to achieve a higher sum.

Alternative approach:

- Set row 1 to [3,2,1].

- Set row 2 to [3,2,1].

- Set row 3 to [3,2,1].

Sum: 27.

- Then, if I set column 1 to [3,2,1], it overwrites the first column of all rows:

Matrix becomes:

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Sum: 3+2+1 + 2+2+1 + 1+2+1 = 6 + 5 + 5 = 16, which is worse than 27.

- If I set column 1 to [3,2,1], sum decreases.

So, perhaps it's better to only set rows and not set columns.

In that case, sum is 27, which is higher than the program's 22.

Therefore, the program is suboptimal; it's not achieving the maximum possible sum.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the n=2 case, it achieves sum 7, which matches the example.

In that case, perhaps for n=2, sum 7 is indeed the maximum, but for n=3, sum 27 is possible.

Wait, but maybe for n=2, sum 7 is the best possible.

Let me check.

For n=2:

- Set row 1 to [2,1].

- Set row 2 to [2,1].

Sum: 2+1 + 2+1 = 6.

But in the program's approach, sum is 7.

Wait, how is that possible?

Wait, in the program's approach for n=2:

- Set row 1 to [2,1].

- Set column 1 to [2,1].

- Set row 2 to [2,1].

- Set column 2 to [2,1].

Matrix:

2 2

1 1

Sum: 2+2 + 1+1 = 6.

But in the example, sum is 7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Looking back at the example in the problem description for n=2:

Output:

7 3

1 1 1 2

1 2 1 2

2 1 1 2

Let's simulate this:

Initial matrix:

0 0

0 0

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1, set to [1,2].

Matrix:

1 2

0 0

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2, set to [1,2].

Matrix:

1 2

1 2

Operation 3: Type 2 on column 1, set to [1,2].

Matrix:

1 2

2 2

Sum: 1+2 + 2+2 = 7.

So, sum is 7.

But according to my earlier manual approach, setting all rows to [2,1] gives sum 6, which is less than 7.

Wait, but how can setting rows to [1,2] and then setting column 1 to [1,2] give a higher sum?

Because in the first row, it's [1,2], and in the second row, after setting column 1 to [1,2], it becomes [2,2].

So, sum is 1+2 + 2+2 = 7.

But if I set rows to [2,1] and [2,1], sum is 2+1 + 2+1 = 6.

So, in n=2, sum 7 is higher than 6.

But for n=3, setting rows to [3,2,1] gives sum 27, which seems better than the program's sum of 22.

But according to the program's formula, for n=3, sum is 22.

Is there a way to get sum 27 using up to 6 operations?

Yes, by setting all three rows to [3,2,1], which uses 3 operations, which is within the limit of 6 operations.

So, for n=3, sum 27 is achievable, which is higher than the program's sum of 22.

Hence, the program is incorrect because it doesn't achieve the maximum possible sum for n=3.

Wait, but maybe the formula is different.

Let me see the formula used in the program: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6.

For n=1: 1*2*3//6=1, correct.

For n=2: 2*3*7//6=14//6=2.333, but in the output, it's 7.

Wait, perhaps it's integer division.

14 // 6 = 2, but in the output, it's 7 for n=2.

Wait, no: n=2, formula gives 2*3*7//6=42//6=7, which matches.

For n=3: 3*4*11//6=132//6=22.

But manual calculation suggests 27 is achievable.

So, the formula is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

But perhaps I'm missing something.

Maybe there's a constraint that prevents us from setting all rows independently.

Wait, but in the problem statement, operations can be performed in any sequence, and we just need to use no more than 2n operations.

So, for n=3, we can set all three rows to [3,2,1] in three operations, achieving sum 27.

This is within the operation limit.

Hence, the program is incorrect because it doesn't achieve the maximum possible sum.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix using at most 2n operations, where each operation allows us to set a row or a column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

### Approach
1. **Initial Understanding**:
    - We can perform two types of operations: setting an entire row or an entire column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
    - Our aim is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
    - To maximize the sum, we should aim to set as many cells as possible to the highest values available.
    - Since operations can overwrite previous operations, we need a strategy that minimizes overwriting higher values.

3. **Solution Code Analysis**:
    - The provided solution calculates the sum using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and performs a fixed set of operations.
    - For each row and column, it sets them to a decreasing sequence from n to 1.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
    - For n=1, the sum is correctly 1.
    - For n=2, the sum is correctly 7.
    - For n=3, manual calculation shows that setting all rows to [3,2,1] gives a sum of 27, which is higher than the program's sum of 22.

5. **Conclusion**:
    - The program does not achieve the maximum possible sum for n=3, hence it is incorrect.

### Solution Code
```python
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Explanation
- **Maximizing the Sum**:
  - The initial approach in the code attempts to maximize the sum by setting rows and columns alternately to a decreasing sequence.
  - However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible sum, as seen in the n=3 case where a higher sum can be achieved by only setting rows.

- **Optimal Strategy**:
  - For n=3, setting all rows to [3,2,1] achieves a sum of 27, which is higher than the program's sum of 22.
  - This indicates that the program is suboptimal and hence incorrect.

- **Final Verdict**:
  - The program is incorrect because it does not achieve the maximum possible sum for all values of n.

Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
