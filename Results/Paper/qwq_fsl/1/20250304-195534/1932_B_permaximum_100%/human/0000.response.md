Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program meets all the requirements for every potential case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all possible scenarios to ensure the program's correctness.

Let's start by understanding the problem description and the program provided.

### Problem Description

The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Each sign i occurs every a_i years (in years a_i, 2 * a_i, 3 * a_i, etc.). For the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur sequentially, meaning each sign must occur strictly after the previous one.

Given the number of signs n and their periodicities a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, considering the sequential occurrence constraint.

### Program Code

```python
t = int(input().strip())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, a))
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 0
        for ai in a:
            if current_year % ai == 0:
                next_year = current_year + ai
            else:
                next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        results.append(current_year)
    return results
```

### Approach to Verification

1. **Understand the Logic**:
    - The program processes multiple test cases.
    - For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0.
    - For each sign's periodicity `ai`, it calculates the next year when the sign occurs after `current_year`.
    - It updates `current_year` to this next year and repeats for all signs.
    - Finally, it collects and prints the results for all test cases.

2. **Check Sequential Occurrence**:
    - Ensure that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
    - The calculation `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` finds the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than `current_year`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - n = 1: Only one sign, should return a_1.
    - All a_i = 1: Should return n since each sign occurs every year.
    - a_i = 1 and n > 1: Should return n.
    - a_i divides a_{i+1}: Need to ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
    - a_i > a_{i+1}: Ensure that the sequence handles decreasing periodicities correctly.

4. **Correctness of Calculations**:
    - Verify that `next_year` is correctly calculated for different values of `current_year` and `ai`.
    - Ensure that if `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, it correctly sets `next_year` to `current_year + ai`.

5. **Time and Space Complexity**:
    - Ensure that the program is efficient enough for the given constraints (t ≤ 1000, n ≤ 100, a_i ≤ 10^6).

### Testing the Program

Let's consider some test cases to verify the program's correctness.

#### Test Case 1

**Input**:

```

1

6

3 2 4 5 9 18

```

**Expected Output**:

```

36

```

**Explanation**:

- Start at year 0.

- First sign at year 3.

- Second sign at year 4 (since 2 is the next multiple of 2 after 3).

- Third sign at year 8 (next multiple of 4 after 4 is 8).

- Fourth sign at year 10 (next multiple of 5 after 8 is 10).

- Fifth sign at year 18 (next multiple of 9 after 10 is 18).

- Sixth sign at year 36 (next multiple of 18 after 18 is 36).

This matches the expected output.

#### Test Case 2

**Input**:

```

1

5

1 2 3 4 5

```

**Expected Output**:

```

5

```

**Explanation**:

- Start at year 0.

- First sign at year 1.

- Second sign at year 2.

- Third sign at year 3.

- Fourth sign at year 4.

- Fifth sign at year 5.

This matches the expected output.

#### Test Case 3

**Input**:

```

1

5

1 1 1 1 1

```

**Expected Output**:

```

5

```

**Explanation**:

- Start at year 0.

- Each sign occurs every year, so signs occur in years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

This matches the expected output.

#### Test Case 4

**Input**:

```

1

6

50 30 711 200 503 1006

```

**Expected Output**:

```

2012

```

**Explanation**:

- Start at year 0.

- First sign at year 50.

- Second sign at year 60 (next multiple of 30 after 50).

- Third sign at year 711 (next multiple of 711 after 60).

- Fourth sign at year 800 (next multiple of 200 after 711).

- Fifth sign at year 1003 (next multiple of 503 after 800).

- Sixth sign at year 2012 (next multiple of 1006 after 1003).

This matches the expected output.

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **n = 1**:

**Input**:

```

1

1

10

```

**Expected Output**:

```

10

```

**Explanation**:

- Only one sign occurring every 10 years, so the first occurrence is at year 10.

**Input**:

```

5

1 1 1 1 1

```

**Expected Output**:

```

**Expected Output**:

```

10

```

**Explanation**:

- Start at year 0.

- First sign at year 5.

- Second sign at year 6 (next multiple of 3 after 5).

- Third sign at year 8 (next multiple of 2 after 6).

### Conclusion

After testing various cases, including edge cases, the program consistently calculates the correct year for the n-th sign to occur, adhering to the sequential occurrence constraint. The logic for determining the next year for each sign is accurate, and the program handles all specified scenarios correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
