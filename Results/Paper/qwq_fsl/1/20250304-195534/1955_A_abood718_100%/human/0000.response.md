Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program is completely correct.

First, let's understand the problem description. Maxim wants to buy exactly n yogurts. The store has two pricing options:

1. Buy one yogurt for a burles.

2. Buy two yogurts for b burles, which might be a promotion.

My goal is to help Maxim spend the minimum amount of burles to buy exactly n yogurts, choosing between these two options optimally.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())

if B * 2 < C:

print(A * B)

elif A % 2 == 0:

print(int(A * C / 2))

else:

X = A // 2

print(X * C + B)

I need to verify if this function correctly calculates the minimum cost for any given n, a, and b.

Let me break down the logic of this program:

1. It reads the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case, it reads n, a, and b.

3. It checks if the cost of buying two yogurts individually (2*a) is less than the promotion price (b). If so, it's better to buy all yogurts individually.

4. If 2*a is not less than b, it checks if n is even. If n is even, it calculates the cost as (n/2)*b.

5. If n is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible (n//2 pairs) and then buys one yogurt individually, so the cost is (n//2)*b + a.

Wait a minute, in the code, it's X = A // 2 and then print(X * C + B). So, it's indeed buying X pairs and one yogurt individually.

But I need to verify if this logic is always correct.

Let's consider some examples to test this logic.

Example from the problem:

Input:

4

2 5 9

3 5 9

3 5 11

4 5 11

Output:

9

14

15

20

Let's verify these one by one.

First test case: n=2, a=5, b=9

Option 1: Buy two individually: 5 + 5 = 10

Option 2: Buy the promotion: 9

So, minimum is 9.

Program output: 9 (correct)

Second test case: n=3, a=5, b=9

Option 1: Buy three individually: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15

Option 2: Buy one promotion (two yogurts for 9) and one individually for 5: total 14

So, minimum is 14.

Program output: 14 (correct)

Third test case: n=3, a=5, b=11

Option 1: Buy three individually: 15

Option 2: Buy one promotion (two yogurts for 11) and one individually for 5: total 16

So, minimum is 15.

Wait, according to the note, it's better to buy three individually for 15 instead of using the promotion.

But according to the program:

n=3, a=5, b=11

Check if 2*a < b: 10 < 11 â†’ False

Then, since n is odd:

X = 3 // 2 = 1

Print(1 * 11 + 5) = 16

But the expected output is 15.

Hmm, so there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's better to buy three individually for 15 instead of using the promotion.

But according to the program, it's calculating 1 promotion (2 yogurts for 11) and one yogurt for 5, totaling 16.

So, in this case, the program outputs 16, but the correct minimum is 15.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, but in the example output, it's given as 15.

Wait, in the problem statement, for n=3, a=5, b=11, output is 15.

But according to the program, it should output 16.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

But wait, in the example output, it's given as 15, but according to the program, it should be 16.

So, either the program is incorrect, or there's a mistake in the example output.

Wait, in the note, it says: "In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5."

So, the program is not considering the option of buying three individually; it's only considering buying pairs and individual yogurts.

So, in cases where buying individually is cheaper than the promotion for pairs, the program doesn't handle it correctly.

Looking back at the program:

if B * 2 < C:

print(A * B)

elif A % 2 == 0:

print(int(A * C / 2))

else:

X = A // 2

print(X * C + B)

So, it's only checking if buying two individually is cheaper than the promotion.

If it is, then buy all individually.

Else, buy as many pairs as possible and buy the remaining individually.

But in the third test case, 2*5 = 10 < 11, so it should buy all individually: 3*5=15.

But according to the program, if 2*a < b, then buy all individually.

Else, buy pairs.

In this case, 10 < 11 is True, so buy all individually: 15.

Wait, but in the program, it's:

if B * 2 < C:

print(A * B)

So, in this case, 2*5=10 < 11, so print(3*5)=15, which matches the expected output.

But earlier I thought it would print 16, but that was a mistake.

Let me re-execute the logic.

Wait, no. If 2*a < b, then buy all individually.

Else, if n is even, buy n/2 pairs.

Else, buy (n//2) pairs and one individual.

So, in the third test case: n=3, a=5, b=11

2*5=10 < 11, so buy all individually: 15.

Which matches the expected output: 15.

Wait, but earlier I thought the program would output 16, but that was incorrect.

So, perhaps I misread the program.

Let me look again.

if B * 2 < C:

print(A * B)

elif A % 2 == 0:

print(int(A * C / 2))

else:

X = A // 2

print(X * C + B)

So, in the third test case: n=3, a=5, b=11

2*5=10 < 11, so condition is True, print(3*5)=15.

Hence, correct.

Wait, but in the earlier step, I thought it would go to else: X=1, print(1*11 +5)=16.

But according to the condition, if 2*a < b, which is 10 < 11, which is True, so print(A*B)=15.

Hence, correct.

I must have misread it earlier.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Wait, but in the note, it says: "In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5."

But according to the program, since 2*a < b, it buys all individually: 15.

Hence, correct.

So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me check another test case.

Fourth test case: n=4, a=5, b=11

Option 1: Buy four individually: 20

Option 2: Buy two pairs: 2*11=22

So, minimum is 20.

Program output: since 2*5=10 < 11, buy all individually: 4*5=20.

Correct.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Wait, but what if 2*a == b?

For example, n=2, a=5, b=10

Option 1: Buy two individually: 10

Option 2: Buy promotion: 10

So, both options cost the same.

According to the program:

if 2*5 < 10: 10 < 10 is False, so since n is even: print(2*10/2)=10.

Correct.

Another case: n=3, a=5, b=10

if 2*5 < 10: 10 < 10 is False, so n is odd: X=1, print(1*10 +5)=15.

But buying two with promotion:10 + one individually:5, total 15.

Alternatively, buy all three individually:15.

So, same cost.

Hence, correct.

What if n=1, a=5, b=10

if 2*5 <10: 10<10 is False, n is odd: X=0, print(0*10 +5)=5.

Correct.

What if n=0, but according to constraints, n >=1, so no need to consider n=0.

Another case: n=5, a=3, b=5

if 2*3=6 <5: False, so n is odd: X=2, print(2*5 +3)=13.

Alternative options:

- Buy two pairs and one individual: 2*5 +3=13

- Buy one promotion and three individually:5 +3*3=14

- Buy all individually:5*3=15

So, minimum is 13.

Correct.

Wait, but 2*3=6 >5, so 2*a > b, so program goes to else.

Hence, correct.

Wait, in this case, 2*a=6 > b=5, so program correctly chooses promotion where possible.

Wait, in the program, the condition is if 2*a < b, then buy all individually.

Else, buy as many pairs as possible and buy remaining individually.

Which seems correct.

Another case: n=4, a=3, b=5

2*3=6 >5, so don't buy all individually.

n is even, so buy two pairs:2*5=10.

Alternative:

- Buy two pairs:10

- Buy one pair and two individuals:5 +2*3=11

- Buy all individually:12

So, minimum is 10.

Correct.

Seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought there was a mistake, but now it seems correct.

Let me think of another case.

n=3, a=3, b=5

2*3=6 >5, so don't buy all individually.

n is odd: X=1, print(1*5 +3)=8.

Alternative options:

- Buy one promotion and one individual:5+3=8

- Buy all individually:3*3=9

So, minimum is 8.

Correct.

Another case: n=4, a=2, b=4

2*2=4 ==4, so according to program, since 2*a < b is False, and n is even, buy two pairs:2*4=8.

Alternative:

- Buy two pairs:8

- Buy one pair and two individuals:4 +2*2=8

- Buy all individually:8

So, all same.

Hence, correct.

What if n=5, a=2, b=4

if 2*2=4 <4: False, so n is odd: X=2, print(2*4 +2)=10.

Alternative:

- Buy two pairs and one individual:8+2=10

- Buy one pair and three individuals:4 +6=10

- Buy all individually:10

So, all same.

Hence, correct.

Another case: n=5, a=1, b=2

if 2*1=2 <2: False, so n is odd: X=2, print(2*2 +1)=5.

Alternative:

- Buy two pairs and one individual:4+1=5

- Buy one pair and three individuals:2+3=5

- Buy all individually:5

So, all same.

Hence, correct.

Wait, but according to the program, if 2*a == b, it will go to else, meaning it will buy pairs where possible.

But in this case, it's the same cost, so it's fine.

Seems correct.

Is there any case where the program fails?

Let me think about n=0, but n >=1, so no.

n=1: correctly handles.

n=2: correctly handles.

n=3: correctly handles.

n=4: correctly handles.

Seems consistent.

Wait, perhaps I was mistaken earlier.

In the third test case, n=3, a=5, b=11

2*a=10 <11, so buy all individually:15.

Which matches the expected output:15.

Earlier, I thought the program would output 16, but actually, according to the condition, it should print 15.

Hence, correct.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

I can't find any case where it fails.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

But to be thorough, I should consider more cases.

Case: n=6, a=4, b=7

if 2*4=8 >7, so don't buy all individually.

n is even: buy three pairs:3*7=21.

Alternative:

- Buy three pairs:21

- Buy two pairs and two individuals:2*7 +2*4=14+8=22

- Buy one pair and four individuals:7 +4*4=7+16=23

- Buy all individually:24

So, minimum is 21.

Correct.

Another case: n=7, a=4, b=7

if 2*4=8 >7, so don't buy all individually.

n is odd: X=3, print(3*7 +4)=21+4=25.

Alternative:

- Buy three pairs and one individual:21+4=25

- Buy two pairs and three individuals:14+12=26

- Buy one pair and five individuals:7+20=27

- Buy all individually:28

So, minimum is 25.

Correct.

Seems consistent.

Hence, I conclude that the program is correct.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` for one yogurt and the promotion price `b` for two yogurts.

### Approach
1. **Check if the promotion is beneficial:** Compare the cost of buying two yogurts using the promotion (`b`) with the cost of buying them individually (`2*a`). If `2*a < b`, it's cheaper to always buy yogurts individually.
2. **Even number of yogurts:** If `n` is even and the promotion is beneficial (`2*a >= b`), buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
3. **Odd number of yogurts:** If `n` is odd and the promotion is beneficial, buy as many pairs as possible and one yogurt individually.

### Solution Code
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(n * a)
        elif n % 2 == 0:
            print((n // 2) * b)
        else:
            pairs = n // 2
            print(pairs * b + a)

func()
```

### Explanation
- **Step 1:** Read the number of test cases, `t`.
- **Step 2:** For each test case, read the values `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- **Step 3:** If `2*a < b`, it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually. Print `n*a`.
- **Step 4:** If `n` is even and `2*a >= b`, buy `n/2` pairs. Print `(n // 2) * b`.
- **Step 5:** If `n` is odd and `2*a >= b`, buy `(n//2)` pairs and one yogurt individually. Print `(n // 2) * b + a`.

This approach ensures that we always choose the cheapest option available, either using the promotion or buying individually, based on the given prices and the number of yogurts needed.
