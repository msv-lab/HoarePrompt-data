Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program is correct, I need to print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that partially correct programs are considered incorrect. I need to ensure that the program handles all potential cases as per the problem description.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Let's read the problem description carefully.

We have three friends playing chess games together. In each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0 points, and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each. The same pair can play multiple times, including zero times, and it's possible that no games were played at all.

After all the games, their scores are p1, p2, and p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given these scores. If it's impossible to achieve these scores through any valid set of games, I should print -1.

So, my task is to verify if the provided program correctly computes the maximum number of draws for given scores p1, p2, p3 under the constraints.

Let's look at the program:

```python
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats
```

I need to verify if this program correctly computes the maximum number of draws for each test case.

First, I need to understand the logic behind the program.

1. **Total Points and Matches:**

- Each match can either be a win/loss (total 2 points distributed: 2 to winner, 0 to loser) or a draw (total 2 points distributed: 1 to each player).

- Therefore, the total points should always be even because each match contributes exactly 2 points to the total.

- So, if the total points are odd, it's impossible, and the program correctly returns -1 in this case.

2. **Total Matches:**

- total_matchs = total_points // 2

- This calculates the total number of matches played.

3. **Constraints on Matches:**

- The program checks if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs, returning -1 if true.

- Wait, why is there a check for total_matchs > 3? The problem doesn't specify any limit on the number of matches. This seems suspicious.

4. **Calculating Draws:**

- egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

- Then, egalites // 2 gives the number of draws.

- I need to understand why this formula is used.

Let me try to derive the correct approach.

### Correct Approach

Let's denote:

- Let a, b, c be the number of matches played between players 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and 2 and 3, respectively.

- Let d1, d2, d3 be the number of draws in those matches.

- But tracking draws per match might be complicated.

Alternative approach:

- Let’s consider that each draw contributes 2 points to the total (1 for each player), and each non-draw match contributes 2 points (2 for the winner).

- So, total points = number of matches * 2.

- The number of draws can be calculated based on the individual scores.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of variables.

Let’s denote:

- Let x be the number of draws.

- Let y be the number of non-draw matches.

- Then, total matches: x + y = total_matchs.

- Total points: x * 2 + y * 2 = total_points.

- But this is just total_points = 2 * total_matchs, which we already know.

- We need to maximize x, the number of draws.

- But to maximize x, we need to minimize y.

- However, the distribution of points must be consistent with the scores p1, p2, p3.

Let’s think differently.

Each draw increases both players' scores by 1.

Each non-draw match increases one player's score by 2 and the other's by 0.

Given p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, we need to see if there's a combination of draws and matches that can lead to these scores.

Let me look for a general formula or constraints.

### Constraints and Conditions

1. **Total Points:**

- As mentioned, total_points must be even.

2. **Individual Scores:**

- Each player's score must be achievable based on the matches they played.

3. **Maximizing Draws:**

- To maximize draws, we need as many matches as possible to end in a draw.

Let’s consider that draws contribute 1 point to each player involved.

Non-draw matches contribute 2 points to one player and 0 to the other.

Given p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, we need to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores can be achieved.

I need to find a way to express the scores in terms of draws and wins.

Let’s try to model it with equations.

Let’s denote:

- Let d_ab be the number of draws between player A and B.

- Similarly, d_ac and d_bc.

- Let w_ab be the number of wins for player A in matches against B.

- Similarly, w_ba, w_ac, w_ca, w_bc, w_cb.

But this seems too complicated.

Maybe I can think in terms of total draws involving each player.

Let’s denote:

- Let d1 be the number of draws involving player 1.

- d2 for player 2.

- d3 for player 3.

But there might be overlaps since draws are between two players.

This seems messy.

Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let’s consider that each draw increases the scores of both players by 1, and each non-draw match increases one player's score by 2 and the other's by 0.

Given p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, I need to maximize the number of draws.

Let’s consider the total number of matches is total_matchs = total_points // 2.

Now, to maximize draws, I need to maximize x in x + y = total_matchs, where x is the number of draws and y is the number of non-draw matches.

But I need to ensure that the score distribution is possible.

I need to find a way to express p1, p2, p3 in terms of x and y.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over the possible number of draws and see if the scores can be achieved.

But since it's a programming problem, I need an efficient way.

Wait, maybe I can use linear equations.

Let’s denote:

- Let d be the total number of draws.

- Let w be the total number of non-draw matches.

- Then, d + w = total_matchs.

- Total points: d * 2 + w * 2 = total_points.

But this is just total_points = 2 * total_matchs, which we already know.

I need more constraints.

Let’s consider the individual scores.

For player 1:

- Player 1's score p1 is equal to the sum of:

- 1 for each draw involving player 1.

- 2 for each win involving player 1.

Similarly for p2 and p3.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to set up a system of equations.

Let’s denote:

- Let d_ab be the number of draws between player A and B.

- Similarly, d_ac and d_bc.

- Let w_ab be the number of times player A beats player B.

- Similarly, w_ba, w_ac, w_ca, w_bc, w_cb.

Then:

- p1 = d_ab + d_ac + 2 * (w12 + w13)

- p2 = d_ab + d_bc + 2 * (w21 + w23)

- p3 = d_ac + d_bc + 2 * (w31 + w32)

Where w12 is the number of times player 1 beats player 2, etc.

Given that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, and all w's and d's are non-negative integers.

This seems complex to solve directly.

Perhaps there's a smarter way to maximize draws.

Let me consider that to maximize draws, I should maximize the number of matches that end in a draw, given that the scores are achievable.

This probably involves minimizing the number of non-draw matches.

Each non-draw match contributes a difference of 2 in the scores of the players involved.

Given that, perhaps I can look at the differences in scores and see how many non-draw matches are needed to account for those differences.

Let’s think about it.

### Maximizing Draws by Minimizing Non-Draw Matches

To maximize draws, I need to minimize the number of non-draw matches.

Non-draw matches are those where one player wins and the other loses, contributing a difference of 2 in their scores.

So, the idea is to account for the necessary score differences with as few non-draw matches as possible.

Given that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, the differences between p3 and p1, and p3 and p2, need to be accounted for by non-draw matches.

Let’s denote:

- diff1 = p3 - p1

- diff2 = p3 - p2

These differences must be achieved through non-draw matches where p3 wins.

Each such win increases p3 by 2 and decreases the opponent's score by 0.

Wait, but scores only increase, so it's not about decreasing scores.

Wait, actually, scores only increase, so it's about how much p3 gains compared to p1 and p2.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of p3's advantage over p1 and p2.

Let’s consider that p3 has gained diff1 more points than p1, and diff2 more points than p2, through wins.

Each win contributes a difference of 2 in the scores.

Therefore, the number of non-draw matches where p3 wins is at least ceil(diff1 / 2) and ceil(diff2 / 2).

But since p3 can win multiple matches against the same opponent, I need to distribute these wins appropriately.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal number of non-draw matches to account for the score differences.

Let’s try to compute the minimal number of non-draw matches needed.

Total non-draw matches, y, should be at least the maximum difference divided by 2, rounded up.

But I need a more precise approach.

Let’s consider that the total points can be expressed as:

total_points = 2 * total_matchs

And individual scores are sums of 1 for each draw they were in, plus 2 for each win they had.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I should look for a way to compute the minimal number of non-draw matches required to achieve the score differences.

Let’s denote:

- Let y be the number of non-draw matches.

- Then, the number of draws is x = total_matchs - y.

Our goal is to maximize x, which is equivalent to minimizing y.

So, I need to find the minimal y such that the score differences can be achieved.

To minimize y, I need to maximize the number of draws, but still account for the necessary score differences through non-draw matches.

Let’s consider that each non-draw match can account for a difference of 2 in the scores of the players involved.

So, to achieve a difference of diff1 between p3 and p1, I need at least ceil(diff1 / 2) non-draw matches where p3 wins against p1.

Similarly, for diff2 between p3 and p2, I need at least ceil(diff2 / 2) non-draw matches where p3 wins against p2.

But I need to consider that these matches can overlap if p3 plays both p1 and p2.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the total difference and see how many non-draw matches are needed to cover that difference.

Wait, maybe I should look at the total differences.

Let’s try to think in terms of the sum of differences.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider an example.

### Example Analysis

Take the example from the problem:

Input:

7

0 0 0

0 1 1

1 1 1

1 1 2

3 3 3

3 4 5

1 1 10

Output:

0

1

-1

2

-1

6

2

Let’s analyze the second test case:

p1=0, p2=1, p3=1

Total points: 0+1+1=2, which is even.

Total matches: 2//2=1

If one match was played and it was a draw, then p2 and p3 would both have 1 point, and p1 has 0 points. That matches the scores.

If the match was non-draw, then one player would have 2 points and the other 0, which doesn't match p2=1 and p3=1.

Therefore, there was one draw, and the answer is 1.

Third test case:

p1=0, p2=2, p3=3

Wait, in the input it's (0,2,3), but in the output it's -1.

Wait, but according to the program, it's (0,2,3), but in the earlier explanation, it was (0,1,1). Wait, there seems to be a discrepancy.

Wait, in the problem description, it says:

Input:

7

0 0 0

1 1 10

0 0 6

Output:

0

1

-1

2

-1

6

2

But in the note, it says:

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the third player and it ended in a draw, so the answer is 1.

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in the third example, so the answer for it is -1.

Wait, but in the third test case, it's (0,2,3), but in the output, it's -1.

But according to the program, it's (0,2,3), but in the earlier explanation, it was (0,1,1). There might be a typo.

Wait, in the problem description, it says:

Example Input:

7

But in the note, it mentions:

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1.

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third example, so the answer is -1.

Wait, but in the third test case, it's (0,2,3), but according to the program, it's (0,2,3), but in the earlier explanation, it was (1,1,1). There's confusion here.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem description or in the program's test cases.

Looking back, in the problem description, it says:

Example Input:

7

0 0 0

But in the note, it mentions:

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1.

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third example, so the answer for it is -1.

Wait, but in the third test case, it's (0,2,3), but according to the program, it's (0,2,3), but in the earlier explanation, it was (1,1,1). There's confusion here.

Wait, perhaps the program has a typo in the test cases.

Looking at the program:

cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]

But in the problem description, it shows:

(0,0,0)

(0,1,1)

(0,2,3)

(3,3,3)

(3,4,5)

(1,1,10)

(0,0,6)

But in the note, it mentions:

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1.

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third example, so the answer for it is -1.

Wait, but in the third test case, it's (0,2,3), but according to the program, it's (0,2,3), but in the earlier explanation, it was (1,1,1). There's confusion here.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem description or in the program's test cases.

To avoid confusion, I'll consider the test cases as provided in the program:

cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]

And the expected outputs are:

0

1

-1

2

-1

6

2

Now, I need to verify if the program correctly computes these outputs.

First, let's see what the program does for each test case.

### Program Analysis

The program defines a function func_1(t, cas_de_test) that processes each test case (p1, p2, p3):

1. **Total Points and Parity Check:**

- total_points = p1 + p2 + p3

- If total_points is odd, return -1 (since each match contributes exactly 2 points).

2. **Total Matches:**

- total_matchs = total_points // 2

3. **Constraints on Matches:**

- If total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs, return -1.

- Question: Why is there a check for total_matchs > 3? The problem doesn't specify any limit on the number of matches. This seems unnecessary and possibly incorrect.

4. **Calculating Draws:**

- egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

- If egalites < 0, return -1

- Else, return egalites // 2

I need to understand if this logic correctly computes the maximum number of draws for each test case.

Let’s verify this logic step by step.

### Test Case Analysis

1. **Test Case 1: (0, 0, 0)**

- total_points = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 (even)

- total_matchs = 0 // 2 = 0

- p3 = 0 ≤ total_matchs = 0

- egalites = 0 - 2*(0-0) - 2*(0-0) = 0

- egalites // 2 = 0

- Output: 0 (correct)

2. **Test Case 2: (0, 1, 1)**

- total_points = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 (even)

- total_matchs = 2 // 2 = 1

- p3 = 1 ≤ total_matchs = 1

- egalites = 2 - 2*(1-1) - 2*(1-0) = 2 - 0 - 2 = 0

- egalites // 2 = 0

- But according to the problem, the answer should be 1.

- Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

- According to the program, it should be 0, but according to the problem, it's 1.

- This suggests that the program's logic is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking back:

egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

For test case 2:

p1=0, p2=1, p3=1

egalites = 2 - 2*(1-1) - 2*(1-0) = 2 - 0 - 2 = 0

Then, egalites // 2 = 0

But according to the problem, it should be 1.

So, the program is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, but in the problem description, it says the output is 1 for this case.

Therefore, the program is wrong.

But in the earlier examples, it was mentioned that the program is correct for some examples and incorrect for others.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the program.

Wait, maybe I misread the program.

Looking back:

egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

Wait, perhaps I need to verify this formula.

Let’s think differently.

Suppose we have d draws and y non-draw matches.

Then:

- total_matchs = d + y

- total_points = 2*d + 2*y = 2*(d + y)

- p1 = draws involving p1 + 2*wins of p1

Similarly for p2 and p3.

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a way to maximize d.

Given that, perhaps the formula in the program is incorrect.

Let me consider another approach.

### Alternative Approach

Let’s consider that in order to maximize draws, we need to minimize the number of non-draw matches.

Non-draw matches are required to account for the differences in scores.

Specifically, the differences between p3 and p1, and p3 and p2.

Each non-draw match can account for a difference of 2 in the scores.

Therefore, the minimal number of non-draw matches y is ceil((p3 - p1)/2) + ceil((p3 - p2)/2).

But we need to ensure that y ≤ total_matchs.

Then, the maximal number of draws d = total_matchs - y.

However, we need to make sure that the scores can be achieved with this d and y.

This seems like a plausible approach.

Let’s test it with the second test case:

p1=0, p2=1, p3=1

diff1 = p3 - p1 = 1 - 0 = 1

diff2 = p3 - p2 = 1 - 1 = 0

y = ceil(1/2) + ceil(0/2) = 1 + 0 = 1

total_matchs = 1

d = 1 - 1 = 0

But according to the problem, the answer should be 1.

This suggests that my alternative approach is also flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that p2 and p3 both have 1 point, which can be achieved by one draw between them.

In that case, d=1, y=0.

But according to my earlier formula, y=1, which would make d=0.

But clearly, d=1 is possible.

So, my formula is incorrect.

I need a better way to compute y.

Let’s think about it differently.

To maximize draws, we should maximize the number of matches that end in a draw, given that the scores are achievable.

This means that we should minimize y, the number of non-draw matches.

But y is determined by the minimal number of non-draw matches needed to account for the score differences.

In the second test case, p1=0, p2=1, p3=1.

The difference between p3 and p1 is 1.

To achieve this difference, we need at least ceil(1/2) = 1 non-draw match where p3 beats p1.

But in reality, p3 didn't beat p1 because p1 has 0 points.

Wait, p1 has 0 points, p2 has 1, p3 has 1.

If p3 beats p1, p3 would have 2 points and p1 0, but p3 has only 1 point.

Therefore, p3 didn't beat p1.

So, perhaps p2 and p3 drew against each other.

p2 and p3 draw: p2 gets 1, p3 gets 1.

p1 has 0 points because no matches were played involving p1.

This matches the scores.

Therefore, y=0, d=1.

But according to my earlier formula, y=1, which is incorrect.

Hence, my formula is flawed.

I need a better way to compute y.

Let’s consider that y is the minimal number of non-draw matches needed to account for the score differences.

In this case, since p3 has 1 point and p1 has 0, and p3 didn't beat p1 (because p1 has 0), perhaps p3 drew with p2, and p2 has 1 point.

Wait, p2 has 1 point from drawing with p3.

So, y=0, d=1.

Hence, my earlier formula is incorrect.

I need to find a better way to compute y.

Let’s consider that y is the number of non-draw matches needed to account for the differences in scores.

Specifically, y should be at least the number of times a player has a higher score that cannot be achieved through draws alone.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach altogether.

Let’s consider that in order for the scores to be achievable, the sum of the scores must be even, which is already checked.

Additionally, the maximal score for any player is limited by the total matches they could have played.

But tracking this seems too involved.

Let me look back at the program's logic.

### Program's Logic

The program computes:

egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

Then, egalites // 2 is the number of draws.

In the second test case:

p1=0, p2=1, p3=1

total_points=2

egalites=2 - 2*(1-1) - 2*(1-0)=2 - 0 -2=0

So, egalites // 2 = 0

But according to the problem, it should be 1.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Let’s see how to fix this.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be different.

Let’s consider that the total points come from draws and wins.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total.

Each win contributes 2 points to the winner and 0 to the loser.

So, total_points = 2 * total_matchs

Now, to maximize draws, we need to maximize the number of draws d, such that the scores can be achieved.

Let’s consider that the sum of individual scores is equal to twice the number of matches.

Now, to maximize draws, we need to maximize d, where d is the number of draws.

Each draw increases two players' scores by 1 each, contributing 2 points to the total.

Each win increases one player's score by 2 and the other's by 0.

So, if we have d draws and y wins, then:

- total_points = 2*d + 2*y

- p1 = draws involving p1 + 2 * wins where p1 is the winner

Similarly for p2 and p3.

This seems too vague to derive a formula.

Let me consider that the minimal number of wins y is determined by the maximal score p3.

Since p3 is the highest score, p3 can be at most 2 * (total_matchs - draws against p3).

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Perhaps I need to accept that deriving a direct formula is too tricky and consider a different approach.

### Different Approach: Feasibility Check

An alternative approach is to iterate over possible numbers of draws and check if the scores can be achieved.

Since the maximum possible total_matchs is total_points // 2, and total_points ≤ 90 (since p3 ≤ 30 and there are three players), total_matchs ≤ 45.

Given t ≤ 500, this is feasible.

For each possible number of draws d from total_matchs down to 0:

- Compute y = total_matchs - d

- Check if the scores can be achieved with d draws and y wins.

This would involve checking if there exists a distribution of draws and wins that results in the given scores.

This is more time-consuming but ensures correctness.

However, since the problem requires maximizing draws, we should start with d as high as possible and decrease until a valid distribution is found.

But this might be too slow for t=500 and total_matchs up to 45.

Perhaps there's a smarter way.

### Mathematical Insight

Let’s consider that the sum of the scores is twice the number of matches.

Also, the number of draws d must be such that 2*d ≤ total_points.

Moreover, the individual scores must be achievable given the draws.

Perhaps I can consider that the minimal number of wins y is determined by the maximal score p3.

Since p3 can gain up to 2 per win, the minimal y is ceil((p3 - d)/2), where d is the number of draws involving p3.

This seems too involved.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should accept that the program's logic is flawed and look for a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the program's logic works for some cases but not all.

Let’s consider another test case.

### Test Case 4: (3,3,3)

- total_points = 3+3+3=9, which is odd. So, impossible. Output should be -1.

But according to the problem's sample output, it's 2.

Wait, in the problem's sample output, it's:

3 3 3 -> -1

But in the program's output, it's 2.

So, the program is incorrect for this case.

Wait, but in the problem's sample output, it's -1, but according to the program, it's 2.

This suggests that the program's logic is flawed.

Let’s verify:

For p1=3, p2=3, p3=3:

total_points=9, which is odd. So, impossible. Output should be -1.

But the program would compute:

total_points=9, which is odd, so return -1.

But according to the sample output, it's -1.

Wait, but in the earlier explanation, it was said that for (3,3,3), it's -1.

But according to the program, it should return -1 because total_points is odd.

But in the sample output, it's -1.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion.

Looking back, in the problem description, for (3,3,3), the output is -1, which matches the program's logic.

But earlier, I thought the program would return 2, but that might be a mistake.

Wait, in the problem description, for (3,3,3), output is -1, which matches the program's behavior.

Wait, but earlier I thought the program would return 2, but perhaps I misread.

Let’s check the program's code:

if total_points % 2 != 0:

resultats.append(-1)

continue

total_matchs = total_points // 2

if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:

resultats.append(-1)

continue

egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

if egalites < 0:

resultats.append(-1)

else:

resultats.append(egalites // 2)

For (3,3,3):

total_points=9, which is odd, so return -1.

Hence, the program correctly returns -1 for this case.

But earlier, I thought it returned 2, which was a mistake.

So, the program correctly handles this case.

Another test case: (3,4,5)

total_points=3+4+5=12, which is even.

total_matchs=12//2=6

p3=5 ≤ total_matchs=6
