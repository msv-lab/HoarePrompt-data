Alright, I have been assigned the role of a program verifier. My task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, meaning it meets the requirements in the problem description for every potential input case, I should print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs are considered incorrect. I need to use the source code to understand if there's any missing logic or edge cases that the code isn't handling.

I have some examples to help me understand the task better. Let's look at them.

**Example 1:**

Problem description: Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

Program:

```python

def is_not_prime(n):

    if n < 2:

        return True

    for i in range(2, n):

        if n % i == 0:

            return True

    return False

```

Example Answer 1:

Correctness: **True**.

In this example, the function is supposed to identify non-prime numbers. The function returns True for numbers less than 2 and for numbers that have divisors other than 1 and themselves. For prime numbers, it returns False. This seems correct based on the description.

**Example 2:**

Problem description: Write a Python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with the same characters.

Program:

```python

def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):

    count = 0

    for i in range(len(s)-1):

        for j in range(i, len(s)-1):

            if s[i] == s[j+1]:

                count += 1

    return count

```

Example Answer 2:

Correctness: **False**.

In this example, the function is supposed to count all substrings that start and end with the same character. However, the program seems to have a logical error in the loop indices. It's possible that it's not counting all possible substrings correctly, especially those of length 1. This might be why it's considered incorrect.

**Example 3:**

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an array.

Program:

```python

def binary_search(arr, target):

    left = 0

    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left < right:

        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:

            return mid

        elif arr[mid] < target:

            left = mid

        else:

            right = mid - 1

    if arr[left] == target:

        return left

    return -1

```

Example Answer 3:

Correctness: **False**.

Here, the binary search function might not be working correctly because in the case where `arr[mid] < target`, it should set `left = mid + 1` to avoid infinite loops when `left` and `right` are adjacent. Also, the final check should be `if arr[left] == target`, but it might not cover all cases correctly. Hence, it's considered incorrect.

Now, moving on to my task:

**Problem description:**

You are given an array \(x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n\). Your task is to find any array \(a_1, \dots, a_n\), where:

- \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).

- \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).

Here, \(c \bmod d\) denotes the remainder of the division of the integer \(c\) by the integer \(d\). For example, \(5 \bmod 2 = 1\), \(72 \bmod 3 = 0\), \(143 \bmod 14 = 3\).

Note that if there is more than one \(a\) which satisfies the statement, you are allowed to find any.

**Input:**

The first line contains a single integer \(t\) (\(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer \(n\) (\(2 \leq n \leq 500\)) — the number of elements in \(a\).

The second line of each test case contains \(n-1\) integers \(x_2, \dots, x_n\) (\(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\)) — the elements of \(x\).

It is guaranteed that the sum of values \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

**Output:**

For each test case, output any \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) (\(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)) which satisfies the statement.

**Example:**

Input:

```

5

4

2 4 1

3

1 1

6

4 2 5 1 2

2

500

3

1 5

```

Output:

```

3 5 4 9

2 5 11

5 14 16 5 11 24

501 500

2 7 5

```

**Note:**

In the first test case, \(a = [3,5,4,9]\) satisfies the conditions, because:

- \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 5 \bmod 3 = 2 = x_2\)

- \(a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4 \bmod 5 = 4 = x_3\)

- \(a_4 \bmod a_3 = 9 \bmod 4 = 1 = x_4\)

**Program to verify:**

```python

def func():

    for _ in range(int(input())):

        n = int(input())

        x = list(map(int, input().split()))

        a = [0] * n

        a[0] = 1000

        for i in range(1, n):

            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]

        print(*a)

```

**My Task:**

Determine if this program correctly generates an array \(a\) that satisfies the given conditions for all possible inputs as per the problem description.

**Approach:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Given \(x_2\) to \(x_n\), find \(a_1\) to \(a_n\) such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Constraints: \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\), \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).

2. **Analyze the Provided Program:**
   - Initialize \(a_1\) to 1000.
   - For each \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), set \(a_{i+1} = a_i + x_{i+1}\).

3. **Check if this Approach is Correct:**
   - Need to verify if \(a_{i} \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) holds for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Given \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i\), then \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_i) \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).
   - For this to be equal to \(x_i\), \(x_i < a_{i-1}\) must hold.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - If \(x_i \geq a_{i-1}\), then \(x_i \bmod a_{i-1} \neq x_i\).
   - Hence, the condition \(x_i < a_{i-1}\) must always be true for this approach to work.

5. **Verify if \(a_{i-1}\) is always greater than \(x_i\):**
   - \(a_1 = 1000\)
   - \(a_2 = a_1 + x_1 = 1000 + x_1\)
   - \(a_3 = a_2 + x_2 = 1000 + x_1 + x_2\)
   - And so on.
   - Since \(x_i \leq 500\) and \(a_1 = 1000\), \(a_{i-1}\) starts at 1000 and increases by at most 500 each step.
   - Therefore, \(a_{i-1}\) will always be greater than \(x_i\) (since \(a_{i-1} \geq 1000\) and \(x_i \leq 500\)).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Since \(a_{i-1} > x_i\) for all \(i\), \(x_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\), which satisfies the condition.
   - Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer:**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]

**Explanation:**

The program initializes \(a_1\) to 1000 and then sets each subsequent \(a_i\) to \(a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\). Given that \(x_i \leq 500\) and \(a_{i-1}\) starts at 1000 and increases by at most 500 each step, \(a_{i-1}\) is always greater than \(x_i\). Therefore, \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\), satisfying the problem's requirements. Thus, the program is correct.
