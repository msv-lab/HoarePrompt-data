Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every potential case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all possible scenarios to ensure the program's correctness.

First, let's understand the problem description. We have three friends playing chess games, where in each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. The scores after all games are p1, p2, and p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or return -1 if the scores are inconsistent and can't be achieved through any valid set of games.

The program provided is:

```python
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats
```

I need to verify if this program correctly computes the maximum number of draws for any given set of scores p1, p2, p3, where p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Total Points and Matchs:**

   - The total points sum should be even because each match contributes either 2 points (in case of a winner and a loser) or 2 points (in case of a draw). So, if the total points are odd, it's invalid, and the program correctly returns -1.

   - The total number of matches is total_points // 2.

2. **Constraints on Matches:**

   - The program checks if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs, returning -1 in such cases. I need to verify if these constraints are necessary or correctly applied.

3. **Calculating Draws:**

   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula: egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1), and then egalites // 2.

I need to understand if this formula correctly computes the maximum number of draws.

Let's think about the problem differently to verify the formula.

### Alternative Approach

Each match can result in either:

- 2 points (one winner and one loser), or

- 2 points (both draw, each getting 1 point).

So, for t matches:

- Total points = 2 * t.

Given p1, p2, p3 are the points of the three players, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

We need to maximize the number of draws.

Let’s denote:

- Let d be the number of draws.

- Let w be the number of matches with a winner.

Then:

- Total matches: t = w + d.

- Total points: 2t = 2w + 2d.

But since in draws, both players get 1 point, and in wins, one player gets 2 points and the other gets 0.

To maximize d, we need to minimize w.

Constraints:

1. The sum of points must be even: p1 + p2 + p3 must be even.

2. The maximum points a player can have is 2 * (t), but considering the way points are distributed.

Wait, but in the program, there are checks like total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs. Why 3? Maybe it's a mistake.

Let me consider the possible number of matches.

Each match involves two players, and there are three players, so possible pairs are:

- Player 1 vs Player 2

- Player 1 vs Player 3

- Player 2 vs Player 3

Each pair can play any number of times, including zero.

So, the total number of matches t can be any non-negative integer such that 2t = p1 + p2 + p3.

Given that, the program checks if total_points % 2 != 0, which is correct.

Then, total_matchs = total_points // 2.

Next, it checks if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs.

I think the check total_matchs > 3 is unnecessary or perhaps a mistake. There's no inherent limit on the number of matches to 3. They could play any number of matches.

Wait, maybe the author intended something else.

Let me think about possible inconsistencies in the scores.

Possible inconsistencies:

- If p3 > total_matchs, that would mean one player has more points than the total matches played, which is impossible because a player can earn at most 2 points per match.

So, p3 <= total_matchs * 2 should hold.

But the program has p3 > total_matchs, which might be a mistake because p3 can be up to 2 * total_matchs.

Wait, p3 <= 2 * total_matchs should hold.

So, perhaps it's a mistake in the condition.

Let me check the example given:

Input:

7

0 0 0

0 1 1

1 1 1

1 1 2

3 3 3

3 4 5

1 1 10

Output:

0

1

-1

2

-1

6

2

Let's verify these one by one.

1. **0 0 0:**

   - No games were played. Correctly outputs 0.

2. **0 1 1:**

   - One game between player 2 and 3, resulting in a draw. Both get 1 point each. Correctly outputs 1.

3. **1 1 1:**

   - The program outputs -1, which is correct because the total points are 3, which is odd, but according to the program, it checks total_points % 2 != 0, which would catch this. Wait, but in the example output, it's -1, which matches.

   - Wait, in the problem description, it's (0,2,3), but in the example input, it's (0,1,1). Maybe a typo in the problem description.

4. **1 1 2:**

   - Total points: 4, which is even.

   - total_matchs = 2.

   - p3 = 2 <= total_matchs * 2 = 4, which is fine.

   - The program outputs 2, which seems correct.

5. **3 3 3:**

   - Total points: 9, which is odd. Should output -1, which matches.

6. **3 4 5:**

   - Total points: 12, which is even.

   - total_matchs = 6.

   - p3 = 5 <= 6 * 2 = 12, which is fine.

   - The program outputs 6, which might be correct.

7. **1 1 10:**

   - Total points: 12, which is even.

   - total_matchs = 6.

   - p3 = 10 <= 12.

   - The program outputs 2, which might be correct.

Given that the program seems to handle these cases correctly, but I need to verify the logic more thoroughly.

### Analyzing the Formula

The program calculates:

egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

Then, egalites // 2.

I need to understand where this formula comes from.

Let’s denote:

- Let a be the number of matches where player 1 and player 2 play.

- Let b be the number of matches where player 1 and player 3 play.

- Let c be the number of matches where player 2 and player 3 play.

Total matches: t = a + b + c.

Total points: 2t.

Now, points for each player:

- Player 1: points from matches with player 2 and player 3.

- Similarly for others.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let’s consider that in each match:

- If it's a draw, both players get 1 point.

- If there is a winner, one player gets 2 points, and the other gets 0.

So, for t matches, if d is the number of draws, then:

Total points = 2d + 2(w) = 2t, where w is the number of wins.

But we need to maximize d.

Constraints:

- p1 + p2 + p3 = 2t.

- p1, p2, p3 >= 0.

- p1 <= p2 <= p3.

Additionally, for each player, the points they have must be achievable given the matches they played.

This seems complex. Maybe the program's approach is correct, but I need to verify it.

### Checking the Program's Logic

Looking back at the program:

1. If total_points is odd, return -1.

2. Calculate total_matchs = total_points // 2.

3. If total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs, return -1.

   - I think the total_matchs > 3 is a mistake. There should be no restriction on the number of matches.

   - p3 > total_matchs would be incorrect because p3 can be up to 2 * total_matchs.

4. Calculate egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1).

   - This seems arbitrary. I need to understand where this comes from.

Perhaps there's a better way to approach this.

### Correct Approach

To find the maximum number of draws, we need to minimize the number of wins.

Each win contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other.

Each draw contributes 1 point to each player.

Given p1, p2, p3, we need to see if there exists a combination of wins and draws such that the points add up correctly.

To maximize draws, we should minimize wins.

Let’s denote:

- Let d be the number of draws.

- Let w be the number of wins.

Then:

- t = d + w.

- Total points: 2d + 2w = 2t.

Given p1, p2, p3, we need to distribute the points such that:

- p1 + p2 + p3 = 2t.

- p1, p2, p3 >= 0.

- p1 <= p2 <= p3.

Additionally, the points must be achievable given the matches played.

This seems too vague. Maybe I should look for necessary and sufficient conditions.

### Necessary Conditions

1. p1 + p2 + p3 must be even.

2. No player can have more points than the total matches played times 2.

   - p1 <= 2t, p2 <= 2t, p3 <= 2t.

3. Since p1 <= p2 <= p3, and considering the way points are assigned, there might be more conditions.

But I need a way to calculate the maximum number of draws.

### Trying to Derive the Formula

Let’s consider that in order to maximize draws, we need to maximize the number of matches where both players get 1 point each.

Given that, we need to see how many such matches can occur without violating the point constraints.

This seems too abstract. Maybe I should look for counterexamples where the program gives incorrect outputs.

### Looking for Counterexamples

Let me try some test cases.

**Test Case 1:**

p1=0, p2=0, p3=0.

- No games were played.

- Correctly outputs 0.

**Test Case 2:**

p1=0, p2=1, p3=1.

- One draw between player 2 and 3.

- Correctly outputs 1.

**Test Case 3:**

p1=1, p2=1, p3=1.

- Total points=3, which is odd.

- Correctly outputs -1.

**Test Case 4:**

p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

- Total points=4, which is even.

- total_matchs=2.

- According to the program, egalites=4 - 2*(2-1) - 2*(2-1)=4-2-2=0.

- Then egalites//2=0.

- But is this correct?

Wait, if p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, is it possible to have 0 draws?

Let’s see:

- If there are two matches:

  - Option 1: Both matches are draws: p1=2, p2=2 (if both draws involve p1 and p2), but p3=0, which doesn't match.

  - Option 2: One draw and one win:

    - Draw between p2 and p3: p2=1, p3=1.

    - Win between p1 and p3: p1=2, p3=1.

    - Total p1=2, p2=1, p3=2, which doesn't match.

  - Option 3: Two wins:

    - p1 vs p2: p1=2, p2=0.

    - p1 vs p3: p1=2, p3=0.

    - Total p1=4, p2=0, p3=0, which doesn't match.

  - Option 4: One win and one loss:

    - p1 vs p2: p1=2, p2=0.

    - p2 vs p3: p2=0, p3=2.

    - Total p1=2, p2=0, p3=2, which doesn't match.

  - Option 5: p1 vs p3: p1=2, p3=0.

    - p2 vs p3: p2=1, p3=1 (draw).

    - Total p1=2, p2=1, p3=1, which matches p1=1, p2=1, p3=2 if adjusted.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe in this case, it's impossible to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, hence the program should output -1, but it outputs 2.

Wait, in the example, it's (1,1,2) and outputs 2, but according to my analysis, it seems impossible.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me check the problem again.

Wait, in the problem description, it says p1 <= p2 <= p3, and in the example, for (1,1,2), it outputs 2, but according to the program, it's calculating egalites=4-2*(2-1)-2*(2-1)=4-2-2=0, then 0//2=0, but in the example, it's outputting 2, which contradicts the program's logic.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the program or in the explanation.

Wait, in the given program, for (1,1,2), it outputs 2, but according to the program's logic, it should output 0.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the program's logic.

Looking back at the program:

egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

Then egalites // 2.

In this case:

total_points = 4

p3 - p2 = 1

p3 - p1 = 1

So egalites = 4 - 2*1 - 2*1 = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0

0 // 2 = 0

But in the example, it's outputting 2, which suggests that perhaps the program has a typo or error.

Wait, in the given program, it's cas_de_test = [(0,0,0), (0,1,1), (0,2,3), (3,3,3), (3,4,5), (1,1,10), (0,0,6)], and outputs are [0,1,-1,2,-1,6,2].

But according to my calculation for (1,1,2), it should be 0, but in the example, it's 2.

Wait, perhaps the program is different from what's provided.

Wait, in the problem description, the third test case is (0,2,3), but in the example input, it's (0,1,1). Maybe confusion.

Wait, in the problem description, it says "Note that in the third example, it's impossible to achieve the scores, so the answer is -1."

But in the program, cas_de_test includes (1,1,10), which is a different case.

I need to reconcile this.

### Revisiting the Program

Looking back at the program:

- It defines t=7 and cas_de_test with 7 tuples.

- It calls func_1(t, cas_de_test) and prints the results.

- The function func_1 processes each tuple and appends the result to resultats.

Given that, and the output provided, I need to verify if the program's logic aligns with the expected outputs.

From the example:

- (0,0,0) -> 0

- (0,1,1) -> 1

- (0,2,3) -> -1

- (3,3,3) -> -1

- (3,4,5) -> 6

- (1,1,10) -> 2

- (0,0,6) -> 2

But according to my earlier analysis, some of these might be incorrect.

### Conclusion

Given the confusion and potential mistakes in the program's logic, I conclude that the program is incorrect. The formula used to calculate the number of draws does not seem to be accurate, and there are inconsistencies between the program's output and logical expectations.

Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
