Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to handle multiple test cases, each involving finding a permutation of length `n` with a specific Manhattan value `k`, or determining that no such permutation exists. The Manhattan value is defined as the sum of absolute differences between each element's value and its position in the permutation.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. A permutation of length `n` is a sequence containing each number from 1 to `n` exactly once. The Manhattan value is calculated as `|p1 - 1| + |p2 - 2| + ... + |pn - n|`. The task is to find such a permutation for given `n` and `k`, or say "No" if it's not possible.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be structured into several functions:

- `func_4()`: This seems to be the main driver function that reads input and coordinates other functions.

- `func_2()`: This function processes the input for one test case, checking if a solution is possible based on `n` and `k`.

- `func_1(n, k)`: This function generates the permutation based on `n` and adjusted `k`.

- `func_3(l)`: This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation if it exists.

The program reads the number of test cases `T` and then processes each test case by calling `func_4()`.

To verify the correctness of this program, I need to ensure that for every possible input within the given constraints, the program behaves as specified in the problem description.

Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Constraints and Requirements

- **Input:**

  - First line: integer `T` (number of test cases, 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4)

  - Next `T` lines: each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12)

- **Output:**

  - For each test case:

    - If a suitable permutation exists:

      - Print "Yes"

      - Print the permutation

    - Else:

      - Print "No"

- **Additional Notes:**

  - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

  - The program should handle large inputs efficiently.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Provided Program

Let's look at each function in the program:

#### `func_4()`

- Reads input for one test case using `func_2()`.

- If `n` is 0, prints "NO".

- Otherwise, generates the permutation using `func_1(n, k)` and prints it using `func_3(l)`.

#### `func_2(n, k)`

- Checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, returns (0, 0) since the Manhattan value must be even.

- Calculates the maximum possible `k` for given `n`:

  - If `n` is odd: `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`

  - If `n` is even: `max_k = n^2 // 2`

- If `k` exceeds `max_k`, returns (0, 0).

- Otherwise, returns `(n, k)`.

#### `func_1(n, k)`

- Adjusts `k` by integer division by 2 (`k = k // 2`).

- Initializes a list `l` with elements from 1 to `n`.

- Iterates from `n-1` to 0:

  - If `k` is 0, returns the list as is.

  - If `1 + i > k`, performs a specific insertion operation.

  - Otherwise, decreases `k` by `i - 1`, removes the last element, and inserts it at a specific position.

This function seems to be constructing the permutation by manipulating the list based on the value of `k`.

### Step 3: Verifying Correctness

To verify the correctness, I need to ensure that:

1. **Edge Cases are Handled:**

   - `n = 1`: Only permutation is [1]. `k` must be 0.

   - `k = 0`: The identity permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

   - `k` is maximum possible: Permutations that maximize the sum of absolute differences.

2. **General Cases:**

   - For various values of `n` and `k`, the generated permutation should have the correct Manhattan value.

3. **Invalid Cases:**

   - When `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, the program should correctly output "No".

### Step 4: Testing the Program

I'll consider some test cases to verify if the program behaves as expected.

#### Test Case 1:

- Input: `n = 3`, `k = 4`

- Expected Output:

  - "Yes"

  - A permutation with Manhattan value 4, e.g., [3, 1, 2]

- Program's Behavior:

  - `func_2(3, 4)`:

    - `k` is even.

    - For `n = 3` (odd), `max_k = (9 - 1) // 2 = 4`

    - Since `k <= max_k`, returns `(3, 4)`

  - `func_1(3, 4 // 2 = 2)`:

    - Initialize `l = [1, 2, 3]`

    - Iterate from `i = 2` to `0`:

      - `i = 2`:

        - `k = 2`

        - `1 + 2 = 3 > 2`: Insert `3` at position `-2` (which is index -2, i.e., second last position)

        - `l` becomes [1, 3, 2]

      - `i = 1`:

        - `k = 2 - (1 - 1) = 2`

        - But `k` is not less than `1 + 1 = 2`, so no operation

      - `i = 0`:

        - `k = 2`

        - Since `k != 0`, no operation

    - Return `[1, 3, 2]`

  - Manhattan value: `|1-1| + |3-2| + |2-3| = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2` ≠ 4

  - **Issue:** The generated permutation does not match the expected Manhattan value.

Given this discrepancy, it seems there's a problem with the logic in `func_1()`. The permutation [1, 3, 2] has a Manhattan value of 2, but the expected `k` is 4. This suggests that the function does not correctly generate a permutation with the desired `k`.

### Step 5: Investigating the Issue

Looking back at `func_1(n, k)`:

- It adjusts `k` by integer division by 2.

- It iterates from `i = n-1` to `0`:

  - If `k == 0`, return the list.

  - If `1 + i > k`, insert the last element at position `-k`.

  - Otherwise, decrease `k` by `i - 1`, remove the last element, and insert it at position `0`.

In the above test case:

- `n = 3`, `k = 4`, so `k //= 2` becomes `k = 2`

- `i = 2`:

  - `1 + 2 = 3 > 2`, so insert `3` at position `-2`, making `l = [1, 3, 2]`

- `i = 1`:

  - `k = 2 - (1 - 1) = 2`

  - `1 + 1 = 2 <= 2`, so remove last element (`2`), insert at position `0`, `l = [2, 1, 3]`

- `i = 0`:

  - `k = 2`

  - Since `k != 0`, no operation

- Final `l = [2, 1, 3]`, Manhattan value: `|2-1| + |1-2| + |3-3| = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2` ≠ 4

This indicates that the logic for constructing the permutation is flawed, as it doesn't achieve the desired `k`.

### Step 6: Considering Another Approach

Perhaps there's a better way to construct the permutation to achieve the desired `k`.

One possible approach is:

- Start with the identity permutation [1, 2, ..., n], which has a Manhattan value of 0.

- To increase the Manhattan value, swap elements to increase the sum of absolute differences.

- Each swap can increase the sum by a certain amount, depending on the positions and values involved.

However, implementing this efficiently, especially for large `n` and `k`, requires careful consideration of time and space constraints.

### Step 7: Conclusion

Given the discrepancy in the first test case itself, where the program outputs a permutation with Manhattan value 2 for `k=4`, it's clear that the program does not correctly generate permutations with the desired Manhattan values in all cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{False}} \]
