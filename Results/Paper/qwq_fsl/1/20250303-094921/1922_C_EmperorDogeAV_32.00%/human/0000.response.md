Alright, I've got this task here. I need to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every potential case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that even partial correctness isn't acceptable— it's all or nothing.

I've been provided with a few examples to understand how this works. Let's look at those first to get a sense of what's expected.

**Example 1:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program: A function that checks if a number is not prime by iterating from 2 to n-1 and seeing if any number divides n without a remainder.

- Example Answer: Correctness: **True**

This seems straightforward. The program appears to correctly identify non-prime numbers by checking for divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Example 2:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to count all substrings starting and ending with the same character.

- Program: A double loop that checks if s[i] == s[j+1] and counts such instances.

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**

I need to think about why this might be incorrect. Maybe there's an edge case where it doesn't count correctly, like when all characters are the same or for single-character substrings.

**Example 3:**

- Problem Description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in a list.

- Program: A binary search implementation with a while loop.

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**

Again, I need to consider why this might be incorrect. Perhaps the way it handles the mid index or the termination condition is flawed.

From these examples, it's clear that I need to be thorough in my analysis. I can't just look at the code and assume it's correct based on initial inspection. I need to think about various test cases and edge cases to ensure the program behaves as expected in all scenarios.

Now, moving on to my actual task:

**Problem Description:**

There are n cities on a number line, each with unique coordinates in ascending order. The task is to find the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another, given specific travel rules.

**Travel Rules:**

1. You can travel directly from city x to any other city y, paying the absolute difference in their coordinates in coins.

2. You can travel from city x to its closest city, paying only 1 coin.

The closest city for each city is uniquely defined, and no city has multiple closest cities.

**Input:**

- t: number of test cases

- For each test case:

- n: number of cities

- a: list of city coordinates in ascending order

- m: number of queries

- m pairs of cities (x, y) to find the minimum coins to travel from x to y

**Output:**

For each query, print the minimum number of coins required.

**Constraints:**

- t ≤ 10^4

- n ≤ 10^5

- Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 10^5

- m ≤ 10^5

- Sum of m over all test cases ≤ 10^5

**Given Program:**

The program reads input for multiple test cases, processes the city coordinates, calculates some prefix sums based on the closest cities, and then answers each query using these precomputed sums.

I need to verify if this program correctly computes the minimum coins for each query in every possible case.

**Approach to Verification:**

1. **Understand the Travel Rules:**

- Direct travel: Pay |a_x - a_y| coins.

- Indirect travel via closest cities: Pay 1 coin to travel to the closest city and repeat until reaching the target city, summing up the costs.

2. **Determine the Optimal Path:**

- The optimal path might be a combination of direct travel and using the cheap 1-coin travels to closest cities.

- Need to find a path from x to y that minimizes the total cost.

3. **Analyze the Given Program:**

- The program seems to compute arrays that indicate the direction to the closest city for each city.

- It then computes prefix sums for these directions.

- For each query, it calculates the cost based on these prefix sums.

4. **Check for Correctness:**

- Ensure that the program correctly identifies the closest city for each city.

- Verify that the prefix sums are correctly calculated and used to answer the queries.

- Consider edge cases, such as:

- Cities where the closest city is immediately adjacent.

- Cities where the closest city is not adjacent.

- Queries where direct travel is cheaper than indirect travel.

- Queries where indirect travel via closest cities is cheaper.

- Ensure that the program handles cases where the path to the target involves multiple hops via closest cities.

**Potential Issues:**

- Incorrect identification of closest cities.

- Miscalculation of prefix sums.

- Incorrect handling of reverse directions.

- Failure to handle cases where the direct path is cheaper than any path via closest cities.

**Testing the Program:**

To verify the program, I should think of various test cases and see if the program produces the correct output.

**Test Case 1:**

- n = 5

- a = [0, 8, 12, 15, 20]

- m = 5

- Queries:

- 1 4

- 1 5

- 3 4

- 3 2

- 5 1

- Expected Output:

- 3

- 8

- 1

- 4

- 14

I need to understand how the program processes this input and whether it arrives at the correct output.

**Understanding the Program:**

- The program reads t test cases.

- For each test case:

- Reads n and the list of city coordinates.

- Computes forward directions to closest cities.

- Reverses the list and computes backward directions.

- Computes prefix sums for forward and backward directions.

- Reads m queries and answers each query based on the prefix sums.

- The function `func_1` determines whether to move to the next city (1) or the previous city (distance to previous city) based on which is closer.

I need to verify if this logic correctly captures the minimum cost paths.

**Potential Flaw:**

- The program assumes that moving to the closest city and using prefix sums will always yield the minimum cost.

- However, this might not account for cases where direct travel is cheaper than indirect travel via closest cities.

**Example of Potential Failure:**

Consider n=3, cities at [0,5,10]

- Closest cities:

- City 1 (0): closest is city 2 (5)

- City 2 (5): closest is city 1 (0) or city 3 (10)? Assuming city 3 is closer.

- City 3 (10): closest is city 2 (5)

Queries:

- 1 3

Possible paths:

- Direct: |10 - 0| = 10 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), total 2 coins

According to the problem, the indirect path should be cheaper.

But what if the direct path is cheaper?

Let's adjust the example:

n=3, cities at [0,4,5]

- Closest cities:

- City 1 (0): city 2 (4)

- City 2 (4): city 3 (5)

- City 3 (5): city 2 (4)

Queries:

- 1 3

Possible paths:

- Direct: |5 - 0| = 5 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), total 2 coins

Indirect is cheaper.

Another case:

n=4, cities at [0,1,2,10]

- Closest cities:

- City 1 (0): city 2 (1)

- City 2 (1): city 3 (2)

- City 3 (2): city 2 (1) or city 4 (10)? Assuming city 4 is closer.

- City 4 (10): city 3 (2)

Queries:

- 1 4

Possible paths:

- Direct: |10 - 0| = 10 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), 3 -> 4 (1 coin), total 3 coins

Again, indirect is cheaper.

Wait, but what if the direct path is actually cheaper than some indirect paths?

Let's consider another example:

n=4, cities at [0,3,4,5]

- Closest cities:

- City 1 (0): city 2 (3)

- City 2 (3): city 3 (4)

- City 3 (4): city 4 (5)

- City 4 (5): city 3 (4)

Queries:

- 1 4

Possible paths:

- Direct: |5 - 0| = 5 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), 3 -> 4 (1 coin), total 3 coins

Still, indirect is cheaper.

Wait, in all these cases, indirect is cheaper. Is there a case where direct is cheaper?

Let's try:

n=2, cities at [0,1]

- Closest cities:

- City 1 (0): city 2 (1)

- City 2 (1): city 1 (0)

Queries:

- 1 2

Possible paths:

- Direct: |1 - 0| = 1 coin

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 (1 coin), same cost.

In this case, both paths cost the same.

But according to the problem, we should choose the minimum cost, so either path is acceptable.

But the program needs to choose the minimum possible, which is 1 coin.

Now, considering that, perhaps the program is correct, as it seems to be calculating the minimum path correctly in these examples.

Wait, but in the first example provided in the problem, for query 1 4, the output is 3, which corresponds to the indirect path via cities 2 and 3.

Similarly, for query 1 5, output is 8, which seems to be the direct path cost.

Wait, but according to the explanation, they used indirect paths for 1 to 4 and then from 4 to 5.

But in the output, for 1 to 5, it's 8, which might be indirect via 2,3,4 and then direct from 4 to 5.

Wait, but in the sample output, for 1 to 5, it's 8, which might be 3 (from 1 to 4) + 5 (from 4 to 5).

But according to the sample output, it's 8, which might be direct from 1 to 5.

Wait, I need to carefully understand the sample.

Wait, in the note, for the first query 1 to 4, they took indirect path with 3 coins.

For second query 1 to 5, they took indirect path to 4 with 3 coins and then direct from 4 to 5 with 5 coins, total 8 coins.

So, in this case, the direct path from 1 to 5 would be |20 - 0| = 20 coins, which is more than the 8 coins via indirect path.

Hence, the minimum is indeed 8.

Similarly, for other queries.

So, in this case, the program needs to correctly compute these minimum paths.

Looking back at the program, it seems to be computing prefix sums based on moving to forward or backward closest cities.

I need to ensure that this logic correctly captures the minimum cost for any query.

**Program Logic:**

- For each city, determine if its closest city is forward or backward.

- Compute prefix sums for these directions.

- For a query from x to y, if x < y, use forward prefix sums from x to y.

- If x > y, use backward prefix sums from x to y.

This seems to be based on the idea that moving to closest cities in a certain direction can be summed up using prefix sums.

But I need to verify if this always gives the minimum cost.

**Potential Issue:**

- The program might not consider the direct path cost between x and y.

- It only considers the cost of moving through closest cities.

- Hence, it might overlook cases where direct travel is cheaper than the indirect path via closest cities.

**Example to Test:**

Consider n=4, cities at [0,1,9,10]

- Closest cities:

- City 1 (0): city 2 (1)

- City 2 (1): city 1 (0) or city 3 (9)? Assuming city 3 is closer.

- City 3 (9): city 4 (10)

- City 4 (10): city 3 (9)

Query: 2 to 4

Possible paths:

- Direct: |10 - 1| = 9 coins

- Indirect: 2 -> 3 (1 coin), 3 -> 4 (1 coin), total 2 coins

Here, indirect is cheaper.

Another query: 1 to 4

- Direct: |10 - 0| = 10 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), 3 -> 4 (1 coin), total 3 coins

Indirect is cheaper.

Another query: 1 to 3

- Direct: |9 - 0| = 9 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), total 2 coins

Indirect is cheaper.

Seems like indirect is always cheaper in these cases.

Wait, but earlier I thought of a case where direct might be cheaper, but perhaps not.

Let me think differently.

Suppose n=3, cities at [0,1,100]

- Closest cities:

- City 1 (0): city 2 (1)

- City 2 (1): city 1 (0) or city 3 (100)? Assuming city 1 is closer.

- City 3 (100): city 2 (1)

Query: 1 to 3

Possible paths:

- Direct: |100 - 0| = 100 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 1 (1 coin), 1 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), total 4 coins

Wait, this seems suboptimal.

Wait, but city 2's closest city is city 1, so from city 2, you can go to city 1 for 1 coin, but that doesn't help in reaching city 3.

Wait, perhaps the correct indirect path is 1 -> 2 (1 coin), then from city 2, since its closest is city 1, but to reach city 3, it's better to go directly from city 2 to city 3, which would cost |100 - 1| = 99 coins.

So total cost would be 1 + 99 = 100 coins, which is same as direct path.

But in this case, direct path is equal to the indirect path.

But according to the problem, we should take the minimum, so either is fine.

But the program might not be considering direct paths at all.

Looking back at the program, it seems to only consider moving through closest cities and summing up the costs, without considering direct paths.

Hence, it might miss cases where direct paths are cheaper than some indirect paths.

Wait, but in the above example, direct path is equal to the indirect path, so no issue.

Another example:

n=4, cities at [0,2,3,100]

- Closest cities:

- City 1 (0): city 2 (2)

- City 2 (2): city 3 (3)

- City 3 (3): city 2 (2) or city 4 (100)? Assuming city 2 is closer.

- City 4 (100): city 3 (3)

Query: 1 to 4

Possible paths:

- Direct: |100 - 0| = 100 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), 3 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), 3 -> 4 (1 coin), total 5 coins

But wait, this is inefficient.

A better indirect path would be 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, costing 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins.

But direct is 100 coins, so indirect is better.

Another query: 2 to 4

- Direct: |100 - 2| = 98 coins

- Indirect: 2 -> 3 (1 coin), 3 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), 3 -> 4 (1 coin), total 4 coins

Again, indirect is better.

Seems like indirect is always better in these cases.

Wait, but what if the direct path is cheaper?

Let me think of another example.

Suppose n=3, cities at [0,1,2]

- Closest cities:

- City 1 (0): city 2 (1)

- City 2 (1): city 1 (0) or city 3 (2)? Assuming both are equally close, but according to the problem, closest city is unique. So perhaps this setup is invalid.

Hence, such a setup is invalid as per the problem constraints.

Another example:

n=4, cities at [0,1,2,3]

- Closest cities:

- City 1 (0): city 2 (1)

- City 2 (1): city 3 (2)

- City 3 (2): city 4 (3)

- City 4 (3): city 3 (2)

Query: 1 to 4

- Direct: |3 - 0| = 3 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, costing 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins

Both paths cost the same.

Hence, either path is acceptable.

But in this case, the direct path might be simpler, but the problem allows both.

Given that, the program needs to ensure it chooses the minimum cost, which in this case is equal.

Another query: 1 to 3

- Direct: |2 - 0| = 2 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 -> 3, costing 1 + 1 = 2 coins

Again, both paths cost the same.

Seems like in all these cases, the program's approach might be correct.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the program is indeed choosing the minimum cost path for all possible cases.

Looking back at the program, it computes prefix sums based on moving to closest cities in forward and backward directions.

Then, for each query, it calculates the difference in prefix sums to get the cost.

This seems to be capturing the cost of moving through closest cities.

But, as per the examples I considered, the direct path cost is sometimes equal to the indirect path cost.

According to the problem, we should choose the minimum cost.

Hence, if the program only considers the indirect path via closest cities and doesn't consider the direct path, it might fail in cases where the direct path is cheaper.

Wait, but in all the examples I thought of, the indirect path via closest cities is equal or better than the direct path.

Is there a case where the direct path is cheaper than the indirect path?

Let me think differently.

Suppose n=4, cities at [0,1,2,100]

Query: 2 to 4

- Direct: |100 - 1| = 99 coins

- Indirect: 2 -> 3 -> 4, costing 1 + 1 = 2 coins

Indirect is cheaper.

Another query: 1 to 4

- Direct: |100 - 0| = 100 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, costing 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins

Indirect is cheaper.

Another query: 1 to 3

- Direct: |2 - 0| = 2 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 -> 3, costing 1 + 1 = 2 coins

Equal.

Another query: 3 to 4

- Direct: |100 - 2| = 98 coins

- Indirect: 3 -> 4, costing 1 coin (since 4 is the closest city to 3)

Wait, is 4 the closest city to 3?

Given cities are [0,1,2,100], distances from city 3 (2):

- To city 1 (0): |2 - 0| = 2

- To city 2 (1): |2 - 1| = 1

- To city 4 (100): |2 - 100| = 98

Hence, closest city is city 2 (1).

Wait, so indirect path from 3 to 4 would be 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, which is not optimal.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, from city 3, closest city is city 2.

But to go from 3 to 4, it's better to go directly from 3 to 4, which costs 98 coins, or via city 2: 3 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), 3 -> 4 (1 coin), total 3 coins.

Hence, indirect is better.

But in this case, the program might compute the indirect path cost as 3 coins, which is correct.

Hence, it seems that in all these cases, the indirect path via closest cities is equal or better than the direct path.

Hence, perhaps the program is correct in always choosing the indirect path via closest cities.

But according to the problem, we need to choose the minimum between direct and indirect paths.

However, in all the examples I've thought of, the indirect path is equal or better than the direct path.

Is there a case where the direct path is cheaper than the indirect path?

Let me think of another example.

Suppose n=3, cities at [0,1,1000000000]

Query: 1 to 3

- Direct: |1000000000 - 0| = 1000000000 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 1 (1 coin), 1 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), total 4 coins

Indirect is much cheaper.

Another query: 2 to 3

- Direct: |1000000000 - 1| = 999999999 coins

- Indirect: 2 -> 1 (1 coin), 1 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), total 3 coins

Again, indirect is cheaper.

Hence, in these cases, indirect is significantly cheaper.

Is there any case where direct is cheaper?

Let me consider n=2, cities at [0,1]

Query: 1 to 2

- Direct: |1 - 0| = 1 coin

- Indirect: 1 -> 2, costing 1 coin

Equal.

Another case: n=2, cities at [0,1000000000]

Query: 1 to 2

- Direct: 1000000000 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2, costing 1 coin

Indirect is cheaper.

Wait, but according to the problem, we should choose the minimum cost, which in this case is 1 coin via indirect path.

Hence, the program needs to ensure that it's choosing the minimum between direct and indirect paths.

But in the given program, it seems to only consider the indirect path via closest cities and doesn't seem to consider the direct path at all.

This is a potential issue.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Sample Input:

1

5

0 8 12 15 20

5

1 4

1 5

3 4

3 2

5 1

Sample Output:

3

8

1

4

14

Let's verify these:

- Query 1 4: Cities 1(0) to 4(15)

- Direct: |15 - 0| = 15 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), 3 -> 4 (1 coin), total 3 coins

- Minimum is 3 coins, which matches the sample output.

- Query 1 5: Cities 1(0) to 5(20)

- Direct: |20 - 0| = 20 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, total 4 coins (but sample output is 8)

Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, according to the note, for query 1 5, it's 3 coins to go from 1 to 4, and then 5 coins from 4 to 5, totaling 8 coins.

Hence, it seems that the program is choosing a path that combines indirect and direct steps to minimize the cost.

Hence, in this case, it's not purely indirect via closest cities, but a combination of indirect and direct steps.

This suggests that my earlier assumption about the program only considering indirect paths via closest cities might be incorrect.

I need to revisit the program to understand how it computes the costs.

Looking back at the program:

- It computes forward directions to closest cities and backward directions.

- It computes prefix sums for these directions.

- For a query from x to y, if x < y, it uses forward prefix sums from x to y; if x > y, it uses backward prefix sums.

I need to understand how these prefix sums are calculated and used.

Looking at `func_1`:

- For each city i (from 0 to n-2), it checks if the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city and sets prog_cities[i] to 1 if forward is closer, else to the distance to the next city.

Wait, this seems unclear.

Wait, in the code:

```python

def func_1(cities, n):

    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)

    for i in range(n - 1):

        back = -99999999

        forward = 99999999

        if i > 0:

            back = cities[i - 1]

        if i < n - 1:

            forward = cities[i + 1]

        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):

            prog_cities[i] = 1

        else:

            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])

    return prog_cities

```

This function seems to determine, for each city i (except the last one), whether the closest city is forward or backward.

- If the forward city is closer, prog_cities[i] = 1.

- Else, prog_cities[i] = distance to the forward city.

Wait, but according to the problem, each city has a unique closest city, so this should be deterministic.

However, in the function, if the forward city is closer, it sets prog_cities[i] = 1, else sets it to the distance to the forward city.

This seems inconsistent.

Moreover, in the main function, it computes prefix sums for these values.

Then, for each query, it calculates the difference in prefix sums to get the cost.

This seems to be summing up the costs of moving through closest cities, but it's not clear how it incorporates the direct path costs.

Given that, perhaps the program is incorrectly ignoring the direct path option in some cases.

To verify, let's consider a test case where the direct path is cheaper than the indirect path.

Suppose n=3, cities at [0,1,1000000000]

Query: 1 to 3

- Direct: |1000000000 - 0| = 1000000000 coins

- Indirect: 1 -> 2 (1 coin), 2 -> 3 (1 coin), total 2 coins

Hence, indirect is cheaper.

Another query: 2 to 3

- Direct: |1000000000 - 1| = 999999999 coins

- Indirect: 2 -> 3 (1 coin)

Wait, according to the problem, you can travel to the closest city for 1 coin.

But, in this case, city 2's closest city is city 1, not city 3.

Wait, given cities [0,1,1000000000], closest cities would be:

- City 1 (0): city 2 (1)

- City 2 (1): city 1 (0) or city 3 (1000000000)? Assuming city 1 is closer.

- City 3 (1000000000): city 2 (1)

Hence, for city 2, closest city is city 1.

Hence, to go from city 2 to city 3, you would need to go city 2 -> city 1 (1 coin), then city 1 -> city 2 (1 coin), then city 2 -> city 1 (1 coin), city 1 -> city 2 (1 coin), and so on, which doesn't lead you to city 3.

Wait, this seems inefficient.

Hence, perhaps in such a case, the program needs to choose the direct path from city 2 to city 3, which costs 999999999 coins, or find a better path.

But according to the problem, you can travel directly between any two cities, paying the absolute difference in coordinates.

Hence, in this case, traveling directly from city 2 to city 3 costs 999999999 coins, while traveling via city 1 costs 1 + 1 + ... which won't help.

Wait, but according to the problem, you can travel directly or via closest cities.

Hence, the minimal cost is the minimum between direct travel and any path via closest cities.

In this case, direct is 999999999 coins, indirect via city 1 is not helpful.

Hence, the minimal cost should be 999999999 coins.

But according to the program's logic, it might choose the indirect path via city 1, which is not optimal.

Hence, this seems like a case where the program might fail.

Hence, the program is incorrect because it doesn't consider the direct path when the indirect path via closest cities is more expensive.

Hence, the Correctness is **False**.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities on a number line, considering both direct travel and travel via closest cities.

## Approach

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Each city has a unique position on a number line.
   - We can travel directly between any two cities, paying the absolute difference in their positions.
   - Alternatively, we can travel to the closest city for 1 coin and repeat this process.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - We need to choose the minimum cost between direct travel and indirect travel via closest cities.
   - Precompute the direction to the closest city for each city.
   - Use prefix sums to efficiently compute the cost of traveling through closest cities.

3. **Implementation**:
   - For each city, determine if the closest city is forward or backward.
   - Compute prefix sums for these directions.
   - For each query, calculate the minimum cost by comparing direct travel and traveling through closest cities using prefix sums.

## Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        cities[i] = int(cities[i])
    forward_cities = func_1(cities, n)
    cities.reverse()
    backward_cities = func_1(cities, n)
    pref_sum_f = [0]
    pref_sum_b = [0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        pref_sum_f.append(pref_sum_f[i] + forward_cities[i])
        pref_sum_b.append(pref_sum_b[i] + backward_cities[i])
    pref_sum_b.reverse()

## Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of cities and their positions.
   - Determine the closest city directions for forward and backward traversals.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - Compute prefix sums for forward and backward directions to efficiently calculate the cost of traveling through closest cities.

3. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, calculate both the direct travel cost and the indirect travel cost using prefix sums.
   - Print the minimum of these two costs.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Determine for each city whether the closest city is forward or backward.
   - Record this information in a list which is used to compute prefix sums.

By considering both direct and indirect travel options and choosing the minimum cost, this approach ensures the optimal solution for each query.
