Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The goal is to print "True" if the program meets the requirements for every possible input case and "False" otherwise. I need to think step-by-step and consider if there are any edge cases or scenarios where the program might fail.

Let's start by understanding the problem description. We are supposed to create a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25, such that:

1. There is no subsequence of the sequence that sums to a given integer k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n (inclusive), where v is not equal to k, there exists a subsequence of the sequence that sums to v.

Additionally, it's guaranteed that a solution always exists under the given constraints, and we need to output the sequence that satisfies these conditions.

Now, looking at the provided program, it seems to be a complete script that reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results accordingly. The main function is func_14(), which seems to handle the logic for generating the sequence based on the input values n and k.

First, I need to understand how the program generates the sequence. Let's look inside func_14():

- It takes inputs n and k.

- It converts n to its binary representation and calculates its length l.

- If k is 1, it handles it differently; otherwise, it follows another approach.

- It constructs a list ans, which seems to be the sequence to be returned.

- Finally, it returns the length of ans and the sequence itself.

I need to verify if this sequence satisfies the two conditions mentioned in the problem description for every possible n and k within the given constraints.

Let's consider the case when k = 1:

- The program sets ans = [2, 3], and then appends 2^i for i from 2 to l-1.

- We need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 1, and that every v from 1 to n (v ≠ 1) can be formed by some subsequence.

- Since all elements are at least 2, any subsequence sum will be at least 2, so no subsequence can sum to 1. That satisfies the first condition.

- For the second condition, with elements being powers of 2 starting from 2, they can form any sum that is a combination of these powers, which are all even numbers and sums thereof. However, since v can be any integer from 1 to n, and v ≠ 1, we need to ensure that odd v's can also be formed, which might not be possible with this sequence. Wait, but in this specific case, n=2 and k=2 in the example, but in general, for k=1 and n>=2, we need to see if this sequence can form all v from 1 to n except k=1.

- But wait, in the k=1 case, the sequence starts from 2, and all sums will be at least 2, so for v=1, which is k, there should be no subsequence summing to 1, which is satisfied. For v>=2 up to n, we need to check if all these v's can be formed.

- In the example where n=2, k=2, the output is [1], which sums to 1, but k=2, so it's allowed to have subsequences summing to 1 since k=2. Wait, this seems contradictory to the general approach in func_14().

Wait, perhaps I misread the function. Let's look again.

In func_14():

- If k == 1:

- If n == 2, return '1\n2', which is m=1 and sequence [2]

- Else, ans = [2, 3], then append 2**i for i from 2 to l-1

- Else:

- Convert k to binary, get its length lk

- Initialize ans with powers of 2 from 1 to lk-1

- Append (k - 1 - sum(ans))

- Append (k + 1)

- Append (2 * k + 1)

- Append 2**i for i from lk to l-1

This seems complicated. Maybe I should look at the examples provided in the problem to see if the program generates correct sequences.

Looking back at the example in the problem:

Input:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Output:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

Wait, but in the program, for k=1, it seems to handle it differently, but in the example, for n=6, k=1, the output is [2,3,4,5,6], which seems to avoid summing to 1, and for other v's, there are subsequences that sum to them.

I need to verify if the program generates sequences that satisfy the conditions for these examples.

Let's take the first example:

n=2, k=2

Output:

1

1

So, sequence is [1], which can sum to 1, but k=2, so it's allowed to have subsequences summing to 1 since k=2, but according to the problem, for v from 1 to n where v ≠ k, there should be a subsequence summing to v. Here, v=1 (since v ≠ k=2), and [1] sums to 1, which is correct. Also, there is no subsequence summing to k=2, which is correct.

Second example:

n=6, k=1

Output:

5

2 3 4 5 6

So, sequence is [2,3,4,5,6]

- No subsequence sums to 1, which is correct since k=1.

- For v from 1 to 6, except v=1, there should be subsequences summing to 2,3,4,5,6.

- 2: [2]

- 3: [3]

- 4: [4]

- 5: [5]

- 6: [6]

- So, all are covered.

Third example:

n=8, k=8

Output:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- No subsequence sums to 8, since the smallest sum is 1 and the largest is 7.

- For v from 1 to 8, except v=8, there should be subsequences summing to 1 through 7, which is satisfied by selecting 1 to 7 ones.

Fourth example:

n=9, k=3

Output:

4

7 1 4 1

Sequence is [7,1,4,1]

- No subsequence sums to 3.

- Let's check possible sums:

- 7

- 1

- 4

- 1

- 7+1=8

- 7+4=11

- 7+1+4=12

- 7+1+1=9

- 1+4=5

- 1+1=2

- 7+4+1+1=13

- So, possible sums: 1,2,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,13

- Missing sums: 3,6

- But v from 1 to 9, except v=3, need to be covered.

- So, 6 is missing.

- Wait, but according to the output, it's supposed to cover all v except k=3.

- But 6 is not covered in the sums above.

- Wait, maybe I missed some subsequences.

- Wait, [1,4,1] sums to 6.

- So, 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

- So, it's covered.

- Therefore, all v from 1 to 9 except v=3 are covered, and no subsequence sums to 3.

Fifth example:

n=10, k=7

Output:

4

1 2 8 3

Sequence is [1,2,8,3]

- No subsequence sums to 7.

- Possible sums:

- 1

- 2

- 8

- 3

- 1+2=3

- 1+8=9

- 1+3=4

- 2+8=10

- 2+3=5

- 8+3=11

- 1+2+8=11

- 1+2+3=6

- 1+8+3=12

- 2+8+3=13

- 1+2+8+3=14

- So, sums: 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14

- Missing sums: 7

- So, no subsequence sums to 7

- And all v from 1 to 10 except v=7 are covered.

So, in the examples provided, the program seems to generate correct sequences.

Now, I need to generalize this and see if the program always generates such sequences for any n and k within the constraints.

Looking back at func_14():

- If k == 1:

- Special handling: for n == 2, return [2]

- Else, start with [2,3] and append 2**i for i from 2 to l-1

- Not sure if this always works; need to verify.

- Else:

- Convert k to binary, get its length lk

- Initialize ans with powers of 2 from 1 to lk-1

- Append (k - 1 - sum(ans))

- Append (k + 1)

- Append (2 * k + 1)

- Append 2**i for i from lk to l-1

I need to understand if this logic ensures that no subsequence sums to k and that all other v from 1 to n (v ≠ k) can be formed.

One way to approach this is to consider the properties of the sequence generated.

First, including powers of 2 allows forming a wide range of sums, as binary representations correspond to unique combinations of powers of 2.

However, to exclude sums equal to k, we need to ensure that no combination of the sequence elements sums to k.

The way the sequence is constructed in the else part seems to include k+1 and 2*k+1, which are greater than k, and some adjustments based on sum(ans).

I need to verify if this construction always avoids sums equal to k while covering all other v from 1 to n.

Considering the constraints: n can be up to 10^6, and the sequence can have at most 25 elements, each up to 10^9.

Given that, the sequence needs to be carefully constructed to cover the required sums without hitting k.

Looking back at the examples, it seems to work, but I need to think of potential edge cases where it might fail.

Potential edge cases:

1. k = 1, n = 2: handled separately, seems correct.

2. k = n: need to ensure no subsequence sums to n, but all v from 1 to n-1 are covered.

3. k = n-1: need to ensure no subsequence sums to n-1, but all v from 1 to n except n-1 are covered.

4. k = floor(n/2): a central value, need to ensure no subsequence sums to floor(n/2), but all other v are covered.

5. n = 2, k = 2: handled correctly in the example.

6. n = 1: but n >=2 as per constraints.

7. n = 10^6, k = 1: large n, k=1, need to see if the sequence can cover all v from 2 to 10^6.

8. n = 10^6, k = 10^6: need to ensure no subsequence sums to 10^6, but all v from 1 to 999999 are covered.

I need to think about how the sequence is constructed in these cases.

Looking back at func_14():

- For k ==1:

- If n ==2, return [2]

- Else, start with [2,3] and append 2**i for i from 2 to l-1

- For k !=1:

- Append powers of 2 from 1 to lk-1

- Append (k -1 - sum(ans))

- Append (k +1)

- Append (2*k +1)

- Append 2**i for i from lk to l-1

I need to verify if this sequence can cover all v from 1 to n except k.

First, consider that the sequence includes powers of 2, which can form any sum that is a binary combination of those powers.

However, to exclude k, we need to ensure that no combination sums to k.

One way to do this is to include elements that cover all sums except k.

But including powers of 2 up to a certain point might miss some sums or include sums that equal k.

I think a better approach is to include elements that cover all sums except k.

But in the program, it seems to include some specific elements like k+1, 2*k+1, and adjustments based on sum(ans).

I need to see if this construction always works.

Let me consider a small example not provided in the sample input.

Suppose n=4, k=3

According to the problem, we need a sequence where:

- No subsequence sums to 3

- Subsequences can sum to 1,2,4

Let's see what the program outputs for this.

First, func_14():

- n=4, k=3

- k !=1, so:

- bk = bin(3)[2:] = '11', lk=2

- ans = [1] (since lk-1=1, powers of 2 from 1 to 1)

- ans.append(3 -1 -1) = ans.append(1)

- ans.append(4)

- ans.append(7)

- l = len(bin(4)[2:]) = 3

- append 2**2 =4, but 4 is already in ans

- So ans = [1,1,4,7]

Wait, but 1 is already in ans, so it appends another 1.

Now, check sums:

- 1

- 1

- 4

- 7

- 1+1=2

- 1+4=5

- 1+7=8

- 1+4+7=12

- 1+1+4=6

- 1+1+7=9

- 1+4+7=12

- 1+1+4+7=13

- So sums: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13

- Missing sums: 3, which is k=3

- And we need sums to 1,2,4, which are all covered.

So, it works for this case.

Another example: n=5, k=2

- k !=1

- bk='10', lk=2

- ans=[1]

- ans.append(2-1-1)=ans.append(0)

- ans.append(3)

- ans.append(5)

- l=len(bin(5)[2:])=3

- append 2**2=4

- So ans=[1,0,3,5,4]

- But 0 is allowed, but it doesn't contribute to any sum.

- Possible sums:

- 0

- 1

- 3

- 5

- 4

- 0+1=1

- 0+3=3

- 0+5=5

- 0+4=4

- 1+3=4

- 1+5=6

- 1+4=5

- 3+5=8

- 3+4=7

- 5+4=9

- 0+1+3=4

- 0+1+5=6

- 0+1+4=5

- 0+3+5=8

- 0+3+4=7

- 0+5+4=9

- 1+3+5=9

- 1+3+4=8

- 1+5+4=10

- 3+5+4=12

- 0+1+3+5=9

- 0+1+3+4=8

- 0+1+5+4=10

- 0+3+5+4=12

- 1+3+5+4=13

- So sums: 0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13

- Missing sums: 2, which is k=2

- But we need sums to 1,3,4,5, which are all covered.

- 0 is allowed, but it doesn't help in forming new sums beyond what's already possible.

So, it seems to work.

Another test case: n=7, k=4

- k !=1

- bk='100', lk=3

- ans=[1,2]

- ans.append(4-1-3)=ans.append(0)

- ans.append(5)

- ans.append(9)

- l=len(bin(7)[2:])=3

- append 2**3=8

- So ans=[1,2,0,5,9,8]

- Possible sums:

- 0

- 1

- 2

- 5

- 9

- 8

- 0+1=1

- 0+2=2

- 0+5=5

- 0+9=9

- 0+8=8

- 1+2=3

- 1+5=6

- 1+9=10

- 1+8=9

- 2+5=7

- 2+9=11

- 2+8=10

- 5+9=14

- 5+8=13

- 9+8=17

- 0+1+2=3

- 0+1+5=6

- 0+1+9=10

- 0+1+8=9

- 0+2+5=7

- 0+2+9=11

- 0+2+8=10

- 0+5+9=14

- 0+5+8=13

- 0+9+8=17

- 1+2+5=8

- 1+2+9=12

- 1+2+8=11

- 1+5+9=15

- 1+5+8=14

- 1+9+8=18

- 2+5+9=16

- 2+5+8=15

- 2+9+8=19

- 5+9+8=22

- 0+1+2+5=8

- 0+1+2+9=12

- 0+1+2+8=11

- 0+1+5+9=15

- 0+1+5+8=14

- 0+1+9+8=18

- 0+2+5+9=16

- 0+2+5+8=15

- 0+2+9+8=19

- 0+5+9+8=22

- 1+2+5+9=17

- 1+2+5+8=16

- 1+2+9+8=20

- 1+5+9+8=23

- 2+5+9+8=24

- 0+1+2+5+9=17

- 0+1+2+5+8=16

- 0+1+2+9+8=20

- 0+1+5+9+8=23

- 0+2+5+9+8=24

- 1+2+5+9+8=25

- 0+1+2+5+9+8=25

- So sums: 0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,22,23,24,25

- Missing sums: 4, which is k=4

- And we need sums to 1,2,3,5,6,7, which are all covered.

So, it seems to work.

Wait, but in this sequence, 0 is included, which doesn't add new sums beyond what's already possible with other elements.
