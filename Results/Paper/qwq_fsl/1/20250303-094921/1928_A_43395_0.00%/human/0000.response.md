Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. I need to determine if the program meets the requirements for every possible input case. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I have to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

First, I need to understand the problem description completely. Bob has a rectangle of size a × b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The goal is to determine if he can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90° rotation are considered the same.

So, the key points are:

1. Bob cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.

2. From these two smaller rectangles, he tries to form a new rectangle.

3. If the new rectangle is different from the original one (ignoring rotations), output "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

I need to make sure that the program provided correctly implements this logic for all possible inputs.

Now, let's look at the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

Hmm, this code seems a bit confusing. Let's try to understand what it's doing.

The function `func` reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers a and b. Then, it checks several conditions:

1. If both a and b are even, it prints 'yes'.

2. Else, if either (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b), it prints 'no'.

3. Else, if either (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0, it prints 'yes'.

4. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

First off, the condition `(a - b == -a, a)` looks suspicious. It seems like there might be a syntax error or misunderstanding here. Similarly for `(b - a == -b, b)`.

Also, the condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is odd because `(a - b) % 2` can only be 0 or 1 for integer values of a and b, so `(a - b) % 2 < 0` would never be true.

I think there might be some mistakes in the conditions. Let's try to reason about the problem correctly.

To solve this problem, we need to consider how Bob can cut the rectangle and then rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle.

Let's think about the cutting process:

- If Bob cuts parallel to the side of length a, he gets two rectangles of size (a × c) and (a × (b - c)), where c is the distance from one end.

- Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the side of length b, he gets two rectangles of size (d × b) and ((a - d) × b).

Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces.

Given that rectangles that are rotations of each other are considered the same, we need to check if the new rectangle formed is different from the original one in terms of its aspect ratio.

Wait, but the problem seems to consider rectangles different if their dimensions are not exactly the same or rotations of each other.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Bob has a rectangle of size a × b.

He makes a cut parallel to one side, say he cuts a row or a column.

Then, he has two smaller rectangles.

He can arrange these two smaller rectangles in two ways: side by side or one above the other.

- If he places them side by side, he might get a new rectangle with different dimensions.

- If he places them one above the other, again, different dimensions.

But considering the rotation, we need to account for the fact that rotating a rectangle by 90° makes it the same as another rectangle with swapped dimensions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the area.

The area of the original rectangle is a × b.

After cutting, the two smaller rectangles have areas c × d and e × f, but since they are formed by cutting the original rectangle, their areas should add up to a × b.

Wait, actually, when Bob cuts the rectangle into two parts, the total area remains the same, but the shapes change.

Then, when he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces, he is essentially trying to arrange these two pieces together to form a new rectangle.

The problem is to determine if this new rectangle has different dimensions from the original one, considering that rotations are allowed.

Given that, perhaps there is a mathematical way to determine if such a cut and rearrangement is possible without actually simulating it.

Looking back at the examples provided:

- For a 2×6 rectangle, it can be cut into two 2×3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 4×3 rectangle, which is different from 2×6.

- For a 2×1 rectangle, it can only be cut into two 1×1 rectangles, which can only form a 1×2 or 2×1 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original.

So, in the first case, a new different rectangle is possible, and in the second case, it's not.

Looking at the code, it seems to have conditions based on the parity of a and b, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Let me try to find a general condition for when such a transformation is possible.

Suppose we have a rectangle of size a × b.

Without loss of generality, assume a ≤ b.

Case 1: Cut parallel to the side of length a.

- Suppose we cut a row of height c, then the two pieces are a × c and a × (b - c).

- Now, we can try to arrange these two pieces side by side to form a new rectangle of size (a + a) × c, but that would be 2a × c, which may or may not be equal to a × b.

- Alternatively, we can place them one above the other, which would give a rectangle of size a × (c + (b - c)) = a × b, which is the same as the original.

- So, this doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the two pieces can be rotated before arranging them.

If we can rotate the pieces, then the a × c piece can be rotated to c × a, and similarly for the other piece.

So, if we have two pieces of size c × a and d × a, we can try to arrange them to form a new rectangle.

Similarly, if we cut parallel to the side of length b, we get two pieces of size e × b and f × b.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the total area.

The area of the original rectangle is a × b.

After cutting into two pieces and rearranging them, the total area remains the same.

So, the new rectangle must have area a × b.

Therefore, the possible dimensions of the new rectangle must be pairs of integers (x, y) such that x × y = a × b.

Moreover, the new rectangle should be different from the original one, meaning that (x, y) is not equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

So, the problem reduces to checking if there exists a pair (x, y) such that x × y = a × b, and (x, y) is not equal to (a, b) or (b, a), and x and y are integers.

But, since a and b are integers, x and y must be integers as well.

Moreover, since rotations are considered the same, we only need to consider unique pairs up to rotation.

So, the question is: does there exist a pair (x, y) where x ≤ y, x × y = a × b, and (x, y) is not equal to (a, b)?

If such a pair exists, then the answer is "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

Now, to determine this, we need to check if there's any way to factorize a × b into two integers x and y, such that x ≤ y, and (x, y) is not equal to (a, b).

But, this seems too broad because there could be multiple factorizations.

Perhaps I need to consider the specific way Bob cuts the rectangle.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the possible cuts and how the pieces can be rearranged.

Let's consider that when Bob cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles, he can choose to cut either along the length or the width.

Case 1: Cutting parallel to the side of length a.

- Suppose he cuts a strip of width c, then the two pieces are a × c and a × (b - c).

- Now, he can arrange these two pieces in two ways:

a. Place them side by side to form a rectangle of size a × (c + (b - c)) = a × b, which is the same as the original.

b. Place them one above the other to form a rectangle of size (a + a) × c = 2a × c.

But, 2a × c should be equal to a × b in area, so 2a × c = a × b ⇒ c = b / 2.

So, if b is even, c = b / 2, and the new rectangle would be 2a × (b / 2) = a × b, which is the same as the original.

Wait, but in the example, for 2×6, cutting into two 2×3 rectangles and forming a 4×3 rectangle, which is different from 2×6.

Wait, in this case, 2a × c = 4 × 3 = 12, which is equal to the original area, but the dimensions are different.

So, in this case, it's considered a different rectangle because 4×3 is not the same as 2×6, even though they have the same area.

Similarly, for 2×1, cutting into two 1×1 rectangles, and arranging them to form a 1×2 or 2×1 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original.

So, in this case, no new different rectangle is formed.

Therefore, the condition seems to be that if a and b share a common factor in a particular way, then a new different rectangle can be formed.

Wait, perhaps it's related to whether a and b have a common divisor greater than 1.

But in the example, 2×6 has gcd(2,6)=2, and indeed, a new rectangle can be formed.

Similarly, 3×2 has gcd(3,2)=1, but according to the sample input, it's "Yes", which contradicts.

Wait, no, in the sample input, 3 2 gives "Yes".

Wait, let's check the sample input again.

Sample Input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Sample Output:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

Wait, for 3 2, the output is "Yes", but gcd(3,2)=1.

So, it's not directly related to gcd.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a or b is even.

Looking back at the code, it seems to check if both a and b are even, or if their difference is even or odd.

But I need to think differently.

Let me consider that when Bob cuts the rectangle into two pieces, and then rearranges them, the new rectangle must have dimensions that are achievable by combining the two pieces in some way.

Given that, perhaps the new rectangle's dimensions are constrained by the dimensions of the pieces.

Wait, maybe it's about the possible perimeters or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2.

Wait, in the sample input:

- 1 1: No

- 2 1: No

- 2 6: Yes

- 3 2: Yes

- 2 2: Yes

- 2 4: Yes

- 6 3: No

Looking for a pattern:

- 1 1: Both odd, No

- 2 1: One even, one odd, No

- 2 6: Both even, Yes

- 3 2: One odd, one even, Yes

- 2 2: Both even, Yes

- 2 4: Both even, Yes

- 6 3: One even, one odd, No

From this, it seems that when at least one of a or b is even, it's "Yes", except for some cases like 2 1 and 6 3.

Wait, in 2 1, a is even, b is odd, and the output is "No".

Similarly, in 6 3, a is even, b is odd, and output is "No".

But in 3 2, a is odd, b is even, and output is "Yes".

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" when both a and b are even, or when one is even and the other is odd, but with some exceptions.

Wait, no, in 2 1, one is even, one is odd, and output is "No".

In 3 2, one is odd, one is even, and output is "Yes".

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" when a is even, regardless of b.

But in 2 1, a is even, b is odd, output is "No".

In 2 6, a is even, b is even, output is "Yes".

In 6 3, a is even, b is odd, output is "No".

This is confusing.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for a new rectangle to be formed, the two pieces must be able to be arranged in a way that their sides match up to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Given that, perhaps the cut must be in such a way that the resulting pieces can be combined differently to form a new rectangle.

Looking back at the example, for 2×6:

- Cut into two 2×3 rectangles.

- Arrange them side by side to form a 4×3 rectangle.

Similarly, for 3×2:

- Cut into two 3×1 rectangles.

- Arrange them side by side to form a 6×1 rectangle, which is different from the original 3×2.

For 2×2:

- Cut into two 1×2 rectangles.

- Arrange them side by side to form a 2×2 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

Wait, but according to the sample input, 2 2 gives "Yes", but above, arranging two 1×2 rectangles side by side forms a 2×2 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

Wait, maybe there's another way to arrange them.

If I arrange them one above the other, I get a 1×4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2×2.

So, in this case, a new different rectangle can be formed.

Similarly, for 2×4:

- Cut into two 2×2 rectangles.

- Arrange them side by side to form a 4×2 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

- Arrange them one above the other to form a 2×4 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

Wait, but according to the sample input, 2 4 gives "Yes", so perhaps there's another way.

Wait, if I cut the 2×4 rectangle differently, say cut it into a 2×1 and a 2×3 rectangle.

Then, arranging a 2×1 and a 2×3 rectangle together:

- Side by side: 2×4, same as original.

- One above the other: 4×1 and 4×3, which is different.

But 4×3 is different from 2×4, so "Yes".

For 6×3:

- Cut into two 3×3 rectangles.

- Arrange them side by side to form a 6×3 rectangle, same as original.

- Arrange them one above the other to form a 3×6 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

So, no new different rectangle can be formed.

Hence, "No".

From this, it seems that if there's at least one way to cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle with different dimensions, output "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

Now, to generalize this, perhaps it's about whether a or b is even.

If at least one of a or b is even, then it's possible to cut the rectangle into two pieces and rearrange them to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

But, in the sample input, 2 1 is "No", even though a is even.

Similarly, 6 3 is "No", even though a is even.

Wait, but in 2 1, cutting into two 1×1 rectangles and arranging them side by side gives a 1×2 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

Similarly, in 6 3, cutting into two 3×3 rectangles and arranging them side by side gives a 6×3 rectangle, same as original.

So, in these cases, no new different rectangle can be formed.

In contrast, for 2 2, cutting into two 1×2 rectangles and arranging them side by side gives a 2×2 rectangle, same as original, but arranging them one above the other gives a 1×4 rectangle, which is different.

Hence, "Yes".

Similarly, for 2 4, cutting into two 2×2 rectangles and arranging them side by side gives a 4×2 rectangle, which is the same as original, but cutting into two 2×1 and 2×3 rectangles and arranging them appropriately gives different rectangles.

Hence, "Yes".

So, perhaps the condition is that if both a and b are greater than 1, then it's "Yes", else "No".

But, in the sample input, 1 1 gives "No", which fits.

2 1 gives "No", even though a >1 and b=1.

2 6 gives "Yes", as a>1 and b>1.

3 2 gives "Yes", as a>1 and b>1.

2 2 gives "Yes", as a>1 and b>1.

2 4 gives "Yes", as a>1 and b>1.

6 3 gives "No", but a>1 and b>1.

Wait, doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to whether both a and b are greater than 1 and at least one of them is even.

But in 3 2, a=3 is odd, b=2 is even, and output is "Yes".

In 6 3, a=6 is even, b=3 is odd, and output is "No".

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if a and b are both greater than 1 and not both odd.

In 3 2, a=3 is odd, b=2 is even, not both odd, so "Yes".

In 6 3, a=6 is even, b=3 is odd, but output is "No".

This doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's "Yes" if a and b are both greater than 1 and a is even.

In 3 2, a=3 is odd, but output is "Yes".

So, doesn't fit.

This is tricky.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the greatest common divisor (GCD).

If GCD(a, b) > 1, then "Yes"; else, "No".

But in 3 2, GCD(3,2)=1, but output is "Yes".

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a and b share any common factors other than 1.

But in 3 2, they don't, yet output is "Yes".

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if a or b is even, except for specific cases like 2 1 and 6 3.

But in 2 1, a is even, but output is "No".

In 6 3, a is even, but output is "No".

In 3 2, a is odd, b is even, output is "Yes".

In 2 2, both even, output is "Yes".

In 2 4, both even, output is "Yes".

In 2 6, both even, output is "Yes".

In 1 1, both odd, output is "No".

So, perhaps it's "Yes" if a is greater than 2 and b is greater than 1, or b is greater than 2 and a is greater than 1.

Wait, but in 3 2, a=3>2, b=2>1, output is "Yes".

In 2 1, a=2>1, b=1, output is "No".

In 6 3, a=6>2, b=3>1, output is "No".

Hmm, still doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's "Yes" if a*b is even and not equal to 2.

In 2 1, a*b=2, which is even, but output is "No".

In 3 2, a*b=6, even, output is "Yes".

In 6 3, a*b=18, even, output is "No".

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe it's "Yes" if a or b is greater than 2.

In 3 2, a=3>2, output is "Yes".

In 2 1, a=2>1, b=1, output is "No".

In 6 3, a=6>2, b=3>2, output is "No".

Still doesn't fit.

This is confusing.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that to form a new rectangle, the two pieces must be able to be arranged in a way that their combined dimensions form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

Given that, perhaps the condition is that a and b are not both odd, and a and b are not (1, something).

Wait, in the sample input, 1 1 is "No", 2 1 is "No", 3 2 is "Yes".

So, perhaps it's "Yes" if neither a nor b is 1, and at least one of them is even.

But in 3 2, both are greater than 1, and at least one is even, output is "Yes".

In 2 1, a is greater than 1, b is 1, output is "No".

In 6 3, a and b are both greater than 1, and a is even, output is "No".

Still doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's "Yes" if a and b are not both odd and not both equal to 1.

In 1 1: both odd, output "No".

2 1: a even, b odd, output "No".

2 6: both even, output "Yes".

3 2: a odd, b even, output "Yes".

2 2: both even, output "Yes".

2 4: both even, output "Yes".

6 3: a even, b odd, output "No".

So, that doesn't hold for 2 1 and 6 3.

Alternatively, perhaps it's "Yes" if a and b are not equal to 1 and the area is divisible by 4.

In 2 1: area=2, not divisible by 4, output "No".

2 6: area=12, divisible by 4, output "Yes".

3 2: area=6, not divisible by 4, output "Yes".

Wait, doesn't fit.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to think about the number of ways to cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle.

Given that, perhaps it's "Yes" if there exists at least one way to cut and rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle different from the original one.

From the sample inputs, it seems that when a and b are both greater than 1 and at least one of them is even, it's "Yes", except for some specific cases like 2 1 and 6 3.

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if a and b are not co-prime.

But in 3 2, GCD is 1, output is "Yes".

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's "Yes" if a and b are not both odd or both equal to 1.

But in 2 1, a is even, b is odd, output is "No".

So, that doesn't fit.

This is really tricky.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach entirely.

Let me consider that to form a new rectangle, the two pieces must be able to be arranged in a way that their combined dimensions form a new rectangle with different dimensions from the original.

Given that, perhaps
