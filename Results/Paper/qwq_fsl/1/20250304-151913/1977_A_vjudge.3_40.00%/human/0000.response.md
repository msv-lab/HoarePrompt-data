Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. I need to determine whether the program meets all the requirements specified in the description. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that partial correctness isn't acceptable; the program must handle every potential case as described.

To approach this, I need to thoroughly understand both the problem description and the provided program. I should consider various scenarios and edge cases to ensure that the program behaves as expected in all situations.

Let's look at the problem description and the program given.

### Problem Description

Nikita has some cubes and wants to build a tower using them. He can perform two types of moves:

1. Add exactly one cube to the top of the tower.

2. Remove exactly one cube from the top of the tower.

The goal is to determine if, after a given number of moves `n`, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

### Input

- The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), the number of test cases.

- Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

### Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, otherwise "No".

### Example

Input:

```

3

3 3

2 4

5 3

```

Output:

```

Yes

No

Yes

```

### Explanation

1. **First Test Case (3 moves, 3 cubes):**

   - Add a cube: 1 cube.

   - Add a cube: 2 cubes.

   - Add a cube: 3 cubes.

   - So, "Yes".

2. **Second Test Case (2 moves, 4 cubes):**

   - It's impossible to have 4 cubes with only 2 moves.

   - Possible scenarios:

     - Add, Add: 2 cubes.

     - Add, Remove: 1 cube.

     - Remove, Add: Not allowed since you can't remove from an empty tower.

     - Remove, Remove: Not allowed for the same reason.

   - So, "No".

3. **Third Test Case (5 moves, 3 cubes):**

   - One possible sequence:

     - Add, Add, Add, Remove, Add: 3 cubes.

   - So, "Yes".

### Provided Program

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Analysis

I need to verify if this program correctly determines whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves for any given `n` and `m` within the specified constraints.

#### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**

   - We have `n` moves, each of which is either adding or removing one cube from the top.

   - We need to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

   - We need to consider the constraints of removing cubes only from a non-empty tower.

2. **Key Observations:**

   - The maximum number of cubes we can have is `n` (by adding a cube in each move).

   - The minimum number of cubes we can have is 0 (by removing a cube in each move, but only if the tower isn't empty).

   - The number of cubes can fluctuate during the process, but we need to ensure that we don't try to remove a cube when the tower is empty.

3. **Possible Scenarios:**

   - If `n == m`, it's achievable by only adding cubes.

   - If `m > n`, it's impossible since we can't have more cubes than the number of moves.

   - If `m == n - 1`, it might be achievable depending on the sequence of moves.

   - For other cases, we need a general way to determine possibility.

4. **General Solution:**

   - Each add operation increases the cube count by 1.

   - Each remove operation decreases the cube count by 1, but only if the tower has at least one cube.

   - Let’s denote the number of add operations as `a` and remove operations as `r`. Then, `a + r = n` and `m = a - r`.

   - Solving these equations: `a = (m + n) / 2` and `r = (n - m) / 2`.

   - For `a` and `r` to be integers and non-negative, `(m + n)` must be even, and `m + n >= 0` and `n - m >= 0`.

   - Additionally, we must ensure that at no point does the number of cubes become negative during the sequence of operations.

5. **Simplified Condition:**

   - From `a = (m + n)/2` and `r = (n - m)/2`, both `m + n` and `n - m` must be even, and `n >= m`.

   - However, considering the constraints of removing only from a non-empty tower, we need to ensure that the sequence of operations doesn't lead to a negative cube count.

   - A simpler condition is that `n >= m` and `n - m` is even.

### Verification

Let's verify the provided program against the general solution.

#### Provided Program Logic

1. If `n == m`, print "Yes".

2. Else if `m > n`, print "No".

3. Else if `m == n - 1`, print "Yes".

4. Else if `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0`, print "Yes".

5. Else if `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0`, print "Yes".

6. Else, print "No".

#### Potential Issues

1. **Case 1: `n == m`**

   - Correct: By adding a cube in each move.

2. **Case 2: `m > n`**

   - Correct: Impossible to have more cubes than moves.

3. **Case 3: `m == n - 1`**

   - Not always correct. For example, `n=2`, `m=1`:

     - Possible sequences:

       - Add, Remove: 1 cube.

       - Remove, Add: Invalid (can't remove from empty).

       - Add, Add: 2 cubes.

       - Remove, Remove: Invalid.

     - So, "Yes" is correct only if the sequence Add, Remove is possible.

4. **Case 4: `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0`**

   - This seems too broad. For example, `n=4`, `m=2`:

     - Possible sequence: Add, Add, Add, Remove.

     - So, "Yes" is correct.

   - But consider `n=4`, `m=0`:

     - Possible sequence: Add, Remove, Add, Remove.

     - So, "Yes" is correct.

5. **Case 5: `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0`**

   - For example, `n=3`, `m=1`:

     - Possible sequence: Add, Add, Remove.

     - So, "Yes" is correct.

6. **Else, print "No"**

   - This might incorrectly mark some cases as "No".

#### Edge Cases to Test

1. **n=1, m=0**

   - Sequence: Remove (invalid, can't remove from empty).

   - So, "No".

   - According to the program:

     - n != m (1 != 0).

     - m <= n (0 <= 1).

     - m != n - 1 (0 != 1 - 1 => 0 != 0, which is False).

     - m % 2 == 0 (0 is even), n % 2 == 1 (1 is odd) → don't match both even or both odd.

     - So, "No" is correct.

2. **n=2, m=0**

   - Possible sequence: Add, Remove.

   - So, "Yes".

   - According to the program:

     - n != m (2 != 0).

     - m <= n (0 <= 2).

     - m == n - 1 (0 == 1)? No.

     - m % 2 == 0 (0 even), n % 2 == 0 (2 even) → "Yes".

3. **n=3, m=2**

   - Possible sequence: Add, Add, Add, Remove.

   - But n=3, so can't have 4 moves.

   - Wait, that's invalid.

   - Correct sequence: Add, Add, Remove.

   - So, "Yes".

   - According to the program:

     - n != m (3 != 2).

     - m <= n (2 <= 3).

     - m == n - 1 (2 == 2)? No.

     - m % 2 == 0 (2 even), n % 2 == 1 (3 odd) → don't match both even or both odd.

     - So, "No" is incorrect.

   - Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

4. **n=4, m=2**

   - Possible sequence: Add, Add, Add, Remove.

   - So, "Yes".

   - According to the program:

     - n != m (4 != 2).

     - m <= n (2 <= 4).

     - m == n - 1 (2 == 3)? No.

     - m % 2 == 0 (2 even), n % 2 == 0 (4 even) → "Yes".

5. **n=5, m=3**

   - Possible sequence: Add, Add, Add, Add, Remove.

   - So, "Yes".

   - According to the program:

     - n != m (5 != 3).

     - m <= n (3 <= 5).

     - m == n - 1 (3 == 4)? No.

     - m % 2 == 1 (3 odd), n % 2 == 1 (5 odd) → "Yes".

6. **n=2, m=1**

   - Possible sequence: Add, Add, Remove.

   - But n=2 moves: Add, Remove → 1 cube.

   - So, "Yes".

   - According to the program:

     - n != m (2 != 1).

     - m <= n (1 <= 2).

     - m == n - 1 (1 == 1) → "Yes".

7. **n=1, m=1**

   - Sequence: Add.

   - So, "Yes".

   - According to the program:

     - n == m → "Yes".

8. **n=1, m=0**

   - Can't remove from empty → "No".

   - According to the program: "No".

9. **n=0, m=0**

   - Not applicable since n >=1.

10. **n=4, m=0**

    - Sequence: Add, Remove, Add, Remove.

    - So, "Yes".

    - According to the program:

      - n != m (4 != 0).

      - m <= n (0 <= 4).

      - m != n -1 (0 != 3).

      - m % 2 == 0 (0 even), n % 2 == 0 (4 even) → "Yes".

11. **n=3, m=1**

    - Sequence: Add, Add, Remove.

    - So, "Yes".

    - According to the program:

      - n != m (3 != 1).

      - m <= n (1 <= 3).

      - m == n -1 (1 == 2)? No.

      - m % 2 == 1 (1 odd), n % 2 == 1 (3 odd) → "Yes".

12. **n=5, m=1**

    - Sequence: Add, Add, Add, Remove, Remove.

    - So, "Yes".

    - According to the program:

      - n != m (5 != 1).

      - m <= n (1 <= 5).

      - m == n -1 (1 == 4)? No.

      - m % 2 == 1 (1 odd), n % 2 == 1 (5 odd) → "Yes".

13. **n=3, m=3**

    - Sequence: Add, Add, Add.

    - So, "Yes".

    - According to the program: n == m → "Yes".

14. **n=4, m=4**

    - Sequence: Add, Add, Add, Add.

    - So, "Yes".

    - According to the program: n == m → "Yes".

15. **n=3, m=0**

    - Sequence: Add, Remove, Remove.

    - But this would involve removing from an empty tower after Add, Remove.

    - Wait, after Add, Remove: 0 cubes.

    - Then, Remove from empty → invalid.

    - So, "No".

    - According to the program:

      - n != m (3 != 0).

      - m <= n (0 <= 3).

      - m == n -1 (0 == 2)? No.

      - m % 2 == 0 (0 even), n % 2 == 1 (3 odd) → don't match both even or both odd.

      - So, "No" is correct.

16. **n=5, m=5**

    - Sequence: Add, Add, Add, Add, Add.

    - So, "Yes".

    - According to the program: n == m → "Yes".

17. **n=2, m=2**

    - Sequence: Add, Add.

    - So, "Yes".

    - According to the program: n == m → "Yes".

18. **n=2, m=0**

    - Sequence: Add, Remove.

    - So, "Yes".

    - According to the program: m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0 → "Yes".

19. **n=3, m=2**

    - Sequence: Add, Add, Remove.

    - So, "Yes".

    - According to the program: m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 1 → doesn't match both even or both odd → "No" is incorrect.

20. **n=4, m=3**

    - Sequence: Add, Add, Add, Remove.

    - So, "Yes".

    - According to the program: m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 == 0 → doesn't match both even or both odd → "No" is incorrect.

### Conclusion

From the above analysis, there are cases where the program incorrectly answers "No" when the correct answer should be "Yes". For example:

- **n=3, m=2**

  - Possible sequence: Add, Add, Remove → 2 cubes.

  - Program outputs "No" because it doesn't fit any of the "Yes" conditions after `m == n -1`.

- **n=4, m=3**

  - Possible sequence: Add, Add, Add, Remove → 3 cubes.

  - Program outputs "No" for the same reason.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it doesn't cover all possible valid cases.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
