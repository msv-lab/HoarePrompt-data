Alright, I've been assigned the role of a program verifier. My task is to determine whether a given Python program correctly meets the requirements specified in the problem description. If the program is correct for all potential cases, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to ensure that the program handles all edge cases properly and doesn't have any logical errors.

First, let's understand the problem description. The Chaya tribe believes in n signs of the apocalypse, each occurring every a_i years. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning each sign must happen strictly after the previous one. I need to find out in which year the n-th sign will occur, leading to the apocalypse.

The program provided is as follows:

```python
t = int(input().strip())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, a))
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 0
        for ai in a:
            if current_year % ai == 0:
                next_year = current_year + ai
            else:
                next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        results.append(current_year)
    return results
```

I need to verify if this program correctly determines the year in which the n-th sign occurs, based on the given problem description.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. It reads the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs, n, and the list of periodicities, a.

3. It processes each test case using the function func_1.

4. In func_1, for each test case, it initializes current_year to 0.

5. For each sign's periodicity in the list a, it calculates the next year when the sign occurs:

- If current_year is a multiple of ai, it sets next_year to current_year + ai.

- Otherwise, it calculates the smallest year greater than current_year that is a multiple of ai.

6. It updates current_year to next_year and repeats this for all signs in the list.

7. Finally, it appends the current_year (which is the year the n-th sign occurs) to the results list.

8. It prints the results for each test case.

Now, I need to verify if this logic correctly implements the requirement that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one.

Looking back at the problem description:

- The tribe waits for each sign to occur in sequence.

- After the i-th sign occurs in year x, they start waiting for the (i+1)-th sign starting from year x+1.

So, for each sign, the next sign must occur in a year strictly after the current year.

Let's see if the program ensures that.

In the program:

- For each ai, it calculates the next year when the sign occurs, considering the current_year.

- If current_year is a multiple of ai, it sets next_year to current_year + ai.

- Otherwise, it calculates the smallest multiple of ai that is greater than current_year.

This seems correct because:

- If current_year is a multiple of ai, adding ai directly gives the next multiple.

- If not, it calculates the next multiple of ai that is greater than current_year.

This ensures that each sign occurs in a year that is strictly after the previous sign's year.

Let's check with the example provided in the problem:

Input:

4

6

3 2 4 5 9 18

5

1 2 3 4 5

5

1 1 1 1 1

6

50 30 711 200 503 1006

Output:

36

5

5

2012

Let's verify the first test case:

n=6, a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]

- Start with current_year=0

- For a1=3: 0%3==0 → next_year=0+3=3

- For a2=2: 3%2 !=0 → next_year=(3//2 +1)*2=2*2=4

- For a3=4: 4%4==0 → next_year=4+4=8

- For a4=5: 8%5 !=0 → next_year=(8//5 +1)*5=2*5=10

- For a5=9: 10%9 !=0 → next_year=(10//9 +1)*9=2*9=18

- For a6=18: 18%18==0 → next_year=18+18=36

So, the output is 36, which matches the example.

Similarly, for n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5]

- current_year=0

- a1=1: 0%1==0 → next_year=0+1=1

- a2=2: 1%2 !=0 → next_year=(1//2 +1)*2=1*2=2

- a3=3: 2%3 !=0 → next_year=(2//3 +1)*3=1*3=3

- a4=4: 3%4 !=0 → next_year=(3//4 +1)*4=1*4=4

- a5=5: 4%5 !=0 → next_year=(4//5 +1)*5=1*5=5

So, the output is 5, which matches the example.

For n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

- current_year=0

- a1=1: 0%1==0 → next_year=0+1=1

- a2=1: 1%1==0 → next_year=1+1=2

- a3=1: 2%1==0 → next_year=2+1=3

- a4=1: 3%1==0 → next_year=3+1=4

- a5=1: 4%1==0 → next_year=4+1=5

Output is 5, matching the example.

For n=6, a=[50,30,711,200,503,1006]

- current_year=0

- a1=50: 0%50==0 → next_year=0+50=50

- a2=30: 50%30 !=0 → next_year=(50//30 +1)*30=2*30=60

- a3=711: 60%711 !=0 → next_year=(60//711 +1)*711=1*711=711

- a4=200: 711%200 !=0 → next_year=(711//200 +1)*200=4*200=800

- a5=503: 800%503 !=0 → next_year=(800//503 +1)*503=2*503=1006

- a6=1006: 1006%1006==0 → next_year=1006+1006=2012

Output is 2012, matching the example.

So, the program works correctly for the given examples.

Now, I need to think about potential edge cases to ensure the program is correct in all scenarios.

Edge Case 1: n=1

If there's only one sign, the apocalypse year should be a1, since the single sign occurs every a1 years, starting from year 0.

For example:

n=1

a=[7]

Expected output: 7

According to the program:

- current_year=0

- a1=7: 0%7==0 → next_year=0+7=7

So, output=7. Correct.

Edge Case 2: All a_i=1

If all signs occur every year, then the apocalypse year should be n, since each sign occurs every year, and they must occur sequentially.

For example:

n=4

a=[1,1,1,1]

- current_year=0

- a1=1: 0%1==0 → next_year=0+1=1

- a2=1: 1%1==0 → next_year=1+1=2

- a3=1: 2%1==0 → next_year=2+1=3

- a4=1: 3%1==0 → next_year=3+1=4

Output=4. Correct.

Edge Case 3: a_i=1 and n=1

n=1

a=[1]

- current_year=0

- a1=1: 0%1==0 → next_year=0+1=1

Output=1. Correct.

Edge Case 4: a_i=0

But according to the problem, a_i >=1, so a_i=0 is invalid.

Edge Case 5: a_i=1000000 and n=1

n=1

a=[1000000]

- current_year=0

- a1=1000000: 0%1000000==0 → next_year=0+1000000=1000000

Output=1000000. Correct.

Edge Case 6: a_i=1 and n=100

n=100

a=[1]*100

- current_year=0

- For each a_i=1: current_year %1==0 → next_year=current_year+1

- So, next_year increments by 1 each time, resulting in next_year=n

Output=100. Correct.

Edge Case 7: a_i=2, n=2

n=2

a=[2,2]

- current_year=0

- a1=2: 0%2==0 → next_year=0+2=2

- a2=2: 2%2==0 → next_year=2+2=4

Output=4. Correct.

Edge Case 8: a_i=1 and a_i=2

n=2

a=[1,2]

- current_year=0

- a1=1: 0%1==0 → next_year=0+1=1

- a2=2: 1%2 !=0 → next_year=(1//2 +1)*2=1*2=2

Output=2. Correct.

Edge Case 9: a_i=2 and a_i=1

n=2

a=[2,1]

- current_year=0

- a1=2: 0%2==0 → next_year=0+2=2

- a2=1: 2%1==0 → next_year=2+1=3

Output=3. Correct.

Edge Case 10: a_i=0 (invalid, as per problem constraints)

Since a_i >=1, this case is invalid.

Edge Case 11: a_i=1 and n=0 (invalid, n >=1)

According to the problem, n >=1, so n=0 is invalid.

Edge Case 12: a_i=1000000 and n=100

n=100

a=[1000000]*100

- current_year=0

- For each a_i=1000000: current_year %1000000==0 → next_year=current_year+1000000

- After 100 iterations, next_year=100*1000000=100000000

Output=100000000. Correct.

Edge Case 13: a_i=1 and a_i=1000000

n=2

a=[1,1000000]

- current_year=0

- a1=1: 0%1==0 → next_year=0+1=1

- a2=1000000: 1%1000000 !=0 → next_year=(1//1000000 +1)*1000000=1*1000000=1000000

Output=1000000. Correct.

Edge Case 14: a_i=1000000 and a_i=1

n=2

a=[1000000,1]

- current_year=0

- a1=1000000: 0%1000000==0 → next_year=0+1000000=1000000

- a2=1: 1000000%1==0 → next_year=1000000+1=1000001

Output=1000001. Correct.

Edge Case 15: a_i=2 and a_i=3

n=2

a=[2,3]

- current_year=0

- a1=2: 0%2==0 → next_year=0+2=2

- a2=3: 2%3 !=0 → next_year=(2//3 +1)*3=1*3=3

Output=3. Correct.

Edge Case 16: a_i=3 and a_i=2

n=2

a=[3,2]

- current_year=0

- a1=3: 0%3==0 → next_year=0+3=3

- a2=2: 3%2 !=0 → next_year=(3//2 +1)*2=2*2=4

Output=4. Correct.

Edge Case 17: a_i=1 and a_i=1

n=2

a=[1,1]

- current_year=0

- a1=1: 0%1==0 → next_year=0+1=1

- a2=1: 1%1==0 → next_year=1+1=2

Output=2. Correct.

Edge Case 18: a_i=1 and a_i=2 and a_i=3

n=3

a=[1,2,3]

- current_year=0

- a1=1: 0%1==0 → next_year=0+1=1

- a2=2: 1%2 !=0 → next_year=(1//2 +1)*2=1*2=2

- a3=3: 2%3 !=0 → next_year=(2//3 +1)*3=1*3=3

Output=3. Correct.

Edge Case 19: a_i=2 and a_i=3 and a_i=2

n=3

a=[2,3,2]

- current_year=0

- a1=2: 0%2==0 → next_year=0+2=2

- a2=3: 2%3 !=0 → next_year=(2//3 +1)*3=1*3=3

- a3=2: 3%2 !=0 → next_year=(3//2 +1)*2=2*2=4

Output=4. Correct.

Edge Case 20: a_i=7 and a_i=5 and a_i=3

n=3

a=[7,5,3]

- current_year=0

- a1=7: 0%7==0 → next_year=0+7=7

- a2=5: 7%5 !=0 → next_year=(7//5 +1)*5=2*5=10

- a3=3: 10%3 !=0 → next_year=(10//3 +1)*3=4*3=12

Output=12. Correct.

After considering various edge cases, including minimum and maximum values for n and a_i, the program seems to handle all scenarios correctly. It properly calculates the next year for each sign, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
