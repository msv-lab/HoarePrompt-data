Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to reconstruct a permutation based on a given array 'a', where each element a_i is defined as the MEX of the prefix of the permutation up to that point minus the permutation element itself. The problem guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists for the given input, and my job is to determine if the provided program correctly achieves this for all possible valid inputs.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem thoroughly. We have a permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, and an array a where each a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i. The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in that set. For example, MEX(1,2,3) is 0, and MEX(3,1,0) is 2.

The task is to reconstruct p given a. The program provided seems to do this by iterating from the end of the array to the beginning, calculating each p_i based on the current MEX and a_i.

Let's look at the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))
```

So, the program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the array a. It initializes a result list with None values. It starts with mex set to n and iterates backwards through the array a. For each a_i, it calculates p_i as mex - a_i and updates mex if mex is greater than p_i.

Wait, but according to the problem, a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i, so p_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - a_i. But in the code, it's res[i] = mex - a_i, and then if mex > mex - a_i, mex = mex - a_i.

Hmm, that seems plausible, but I need to verify if this logic correctly reconstructs p.

Let me think about how MEX works in this context. For each prefix p_1 to p_i, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in that prefix. So, as we build the permutation, the MEX changes based on what numbers we've used so far.

The program is iterating backwards, which might be a bit counterintuitive at first, but perhaps it's a way to keep track of the MEX correctly.

Let me consider the example provided:

Input:

3

5

1 1 -2 1 2

5

1 1 1 1 1

3

-2 1 2

Output:

0 1 4 2 3

0 1 2 3 4

2 0 1

So, for the first test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

The corresponding p is [0,1,4,2,3]

Let's verify:

- For i=1: MEX(0) is 1, so a1 = 1 - 0 = 1

- For i=2: MEX(0,1) is 2, a2 = 2 - 1 = 1

- For i=3: MEX(0,1,4) is 2, a3 = 2 - 4 = -2

- For i=4: MEX(0,1,4,2) is 3, a4 = 3 - 2 = 1

- For i=5: MEX(0,1,4,2,3) is 5, a5 = 5 - 3 = 2

Which matches the given a.

Now, does the program correctly generate this p?

Let's simulate the program's logic:

Initialize res = [None, None, None, None, None], mex = 5

i=4, a[4]=2, res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3, since 5 > 3, mex=3

i=3, a[3]=1, res[3]=3 - 1=2, since 3 > 2, mex=2

i=2, a[2]=-2, res[2]=2 - (-2)=4, since 2 > 4 is False, mex remains 2

i=1, a[1]=1, res[1]=2 - 1=1, since 2 > 1, mex=1

i=0, a[0]=1, res[0]=1 - 1=0, since 1 > 0, mex=0

So, res = [0,1,4,2,3], which matches the example.

Another test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

Corresponding p=[0,1,2,3,4]

Let's verify:

- MEX(0)=1-0=1

- MEX(0,1)=2-1=1

- MEX(0,1,2)=3-2=1

- MEX(0,1,2,3)=4-3=1

- MEX(0,1,2,3,4)=5-4=1

Which matches a.

Simulate the program:

res=[None,None,None,None,None], mex=5

i=4, a[4]=1, res[4]=5-1=4, 5>4, mex=4

i=3, a[3]=1, res[3]=4-1=3, 4>3, mex=3

i=2, a[2]=1, res[2]=3-1=2, 3>2, mex=2

i=1, a[1]=1, res[1]=2-1=1, 2>1, mex=1

i=0, a[0]=1, res[0]=1-1=0, 1>0, mex=0

So, res=[0,1,2,3,4], correct.

Third test case:

n=3, a=[-2,1,2]

Corresponding p=[2,0,1]

Verify:

- MEX(2)=0-2=-2

- MEX(2,0)=1-0=1

- MEX(2,0,1)=3-1=2

Which matches a.

Simulate program:

res=[None,None,None], mex=3

i=2, a[2]=2, res[2]=3-2=1, 3>1, mex=1

i=1, a[1]=1, res[1]=1-1=0, 1>0, mex=0

i=0, a[0]=-2, res[0]=0 - (-2)=2, 0>2 is False, mex remains 0

So, res=[2,0,1], correct.

Okay, so the program works for these examples. But I need to ensure it works for all possible cases.

Let me think about the logic. The program iterates from the end to the start, calculating p_i as mex - a_i, and updating mex if mex > p_i.

Wait, but in the first test case, when i=2, a[2]=-2, p_i=4, and mex=2. Then, mex > p_i is 2 > 4 is False, so mex remains 2. But in the next iteration, i=1, a[1]=1, p_i=1, mex=2 >1, so mex=1.

Is there a general rule here?

I need to understand what mex represents at each step.

In the algorithm, mex seems to be the MEX of the prefix up to that point, but calculated backwards.

Wait, maybe mex in the program represents the MEX after processing up to that point.

Let me try to think differently. Let's consider that at each step, when we set p_i = mex - a_i, and then update mex if necessary.

Wait, perhaps it's maintaining the invariant that mex is the MEX of the prefix up to that point.

But in the first test case, at i=4, p_i=3, a_i=2, mex=5, so p_i=5-2=3, then mex=3 since 5>3.

Then at i=3, p_i=2, a_i=1, mex=3, p_i=3-1=2, mex=2 since 3>2.

At i=2, p_i=4, a_i=-2, mex=2, p_i=2 - (-2)=4, but 2>4 is False, so mex remains 2.

At i=1, p_i=1, a_i=1, mex=2, p_i=2-1=1, mex=1 since 2>1.

At i=0, p_i=0, a_i=1, mex=1, p_i=1-1=0, mex=0 since 1>0.

So, it seems that mex is being updated to the actual MEX of the prefix up to that point.

Wait, but in the step i=2, p_i=4, which is greater than mex=2, but in reality, the MEX should be 2, and p_i=4, which is consistent because a_i=-2, which is MEX - p_i =2 -4=-2.

So, the update mex = mex - a_i when mex > p_i ?

Wait, no, in the code, it's if mex > mex - a_i, which is equivalent to if a_i > 0, then mex = mex - a_i.

Wait, no, mex - a_i could be less than mex even if a_i is negative.

Wait, let's see: if mex > mex - a_i, which simplifies to a_i > 0, then mex = mex - a_i.

So, if a_i > 0, mex decreases by a_i.

But in the first test case, at i=4, a_i=2 >0, so mex=5 -2=3.

Then at i=3, a_i=1 >0, mex=3 -1=2.

At i=2, a_i=-2 <=0, so mex remains 2.

At i=1, a_i=1 >0, mex=2 -1=1.

At i=0, a_i=1 >0, mex=1 -1=0.

Which matches the simulation earlier.

So, the update rule is: if a_i >0, mex = mex - a_i.

But is this correct?

Let me think about what MEX should be at each step.

At step i, MEX is the MEX of p_1 to p_i.

Then a_i = MEX - p_i.

So, p_i = MEX - a_i.

Then, for the next step, MEX of p_1 to p_{i+1} is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_{i+1}.

If p_{i+1} is less than the current MEX, then the new MEX remains the same.

If p_{i+1} is equal to the current MEX, then the new MEX increases by 1.

Wait, no, if p_{i+1} is equal to the current MEX, then the new MEX is the next integer.

Wait, more precisely:

- Let current MEX be m.

- If p_{i+1} < m, then the new MEX is still m, because m was not in p_1 to p_i, and p_{i+1} < m, so m is still not in p_1 to p_{i+1}.

- If p_{i+1} == m, then the new MEX is m+1.

- If p_{i+1} > m, then the new MEX is m, because all numbers less than m are already in p_1 to p_i, and p_{i+1} > m, so m is still the MEX.

Wait, no, if p_{i+1} > m, and m was not in p_1 to p_i, but p_{i+1} is greater than m, then m is still not in p_1 to p_{i+1}, so MEX remains m.

Wait, actually, MEX only increases when p_{i+1} == m.

In all other cases, MEX remains m.

Wait, let's think about it:

- Initially, MEX is 0.

- As we add elements, if we add the current MEX, MEX increases by 1.

- If we add any other number, MEX remains the same.

So, MEX increases only when we add the current MEX to the permutation.

Given that, in the program, mex is being updated as mex = mex - a_i when a_i >0.

Wait, a_i = MEX - p_i.

So, p_i = MEX - a_i.

Then, if a_i >0, meaning MEX - p_i >0, which implies p_i < MEX.

If p_i < MEX, then the new MEX remains MEX.

If p_i == MEX, then a_i = MEX - MEX =0.

If p_i > MEX, which is possible since permutation includes numbers from 0 to n-1, and MEX can be up to n.

Wait, in the first test case, at i=2, p_i=4, MEX=2, a_i=-2.

So, p_i > MEX.

In this case, the new MEX remains the same.

Wait, according to the earlier logic, MEX only increases if p_i == MEX.

Otherwise, it remains the same.

So, in the program, when a_i >0, which means p_i < MEX, then mex = mex - a_i.

Wait, but in the first test case, at i=4, a_i=2 >0, so mex =5 -2=3.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, if p_i < MEX, MEX remains the same.

But here, mex is being updated to mex - a_i, which is 5 -2=3.

Wait, that seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps there's another way to look at it.

Let me consider that mex in the program represents the MEX after processing up to that point.

Wait, perhaps mex in the program is the MEX after processing up to i, inclusive.

Wait, in the first iteration, i=4, a_i=2, p_i=3, mex=5.

Then, mex =5 -2=3.

Then, for i=3, a_i=1, p_i=2, mex=3 -1=2.

Then i=2, a_i=-2, p_i=4, mex=2.

Since mex > p_i is 2 >4 is False, so mex remains 2.

Then i=1, a_i=1, p_i=1, mex=2 -1=1.

Then i=0, a_i=1, p_i=0, mex=1 -1=0.

So, in this way, mex seems to be correctly tracking the MEX after each step.

Wait, but according to the problem, MEX is for p_1 to p_i, so it's the MEX up to that point.

In the program, mex seems to be the MEX after processing up to that point.

Wait, perhaps it's the MEX after processing up to i, inclusive.

Wait, but in the first iteration, i=4, p_i=3, a_i=2, mex=5 -2=3.

Then, for i=3, a_i=1, p_i=2, mex=2 -1=1.

Wait, but in reality, after processing i=4, MEX should be MEX(p1 to p4).

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that mex in the program is the current MEX before processing the current p_i.

So, initially, mex =n.

Wait, but n is not necessarily the initial MEX.

Wait, the initial MEX before any elements are added is 0.

Wait, but in the program, mex is initialized to n.

That seems off.

Wait, perhaps mex in the program is the current MEX before processing the current p_i.

So, at i=4, mex=5, p_i=3, a_i=2, then mex =5 -2=3.

Then, for i=3, mex=3, p_i=2, a_i=1, mex=3 -1=2.

Then i=2, mex=2, p_i=4, a_i=-2, mex=2 (since 2 >4 is False).

Then i=1, mex=2, p_i=1, a_i=1, mex=2 -1=1.

Then i=0, mex=1, p_i=0, a_i=1, mex=1 -1=0.

So, it seems like mex is being updated correctly as the MEX before processing each p_i.

Wait, but in the first step, mex=5, which is not the initial MEX.

Wait, perhaps mex in the program is supposed to be the current MEX before adding p_i.

But in the first step, mex=5, which doesn't align with the initial MEX being 0.

Wait, maybe mex in the program is the number of elements not yet placed.

Wait, n=5, mex=5, and as we place elements, mex decreases.

Wait, but in the first test case, after placing p4=3, mex=3.

Then placing p3=2, mex=2, and so on.

Wait, perhaps mex represents the current MEX before adding p_i.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think about the algorithm differently.

Given that a_i = MEX(p1 to pi) - p_i, and we need to find p_i.

So, p_i = MEX(p1 to pi) - a_i.

But MEX(p1 to pi) is not known until we know p_i.

This seems like a circular dependency.

However, in the program, it's calculating p_i as mex - a_i, and then updating mex based on whether mex > p_i.

Wait, perhaps it's maintaining the correct MEX at each step.

Let me consider that at each step, mex is the MEX of p1 to p_{i-1}.

Then, p_i = mex - a_i.

Then, if mex > p_i, update mex to p_i.

Wait, but in the first test case, at i=4, mex=5, p_i=3, since 5 >3, mex=3.

Then at i=3, mex=3, p_i=2, since 3 >2, mex=2.

At i=2, mex=2, p_i=4, since 2 >4 is False, mex remains 2.

At i=1, mex=2, p_i=1, since 2 >1, mex=1.

At i=0, mex=1, p_i=0, since 1 >0, mex=0.

Which seems consistent.

So, the update rule is: mex = min(mex, p_i).

Wait, but in the code, it's if mex > mex - a_i, which is equivalent to if a_i >0, then mex = mex - a_i.

But in reality, mex should be updated to the actual MEX after adding p_i.

Which, as I thought earlier, only increases if p_i == mex, otherwise remains the same.

Wait, but in the program, it's updating mex to mex - a_i when a_i >0.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to look at it.

Let me consider that mex in the program is the MEX before adding p_i.

Then, p_i = mex - a_i.

Then, if mex > p_i, it means p_i < mex, so the new MEX remains mex.

Else, if p_i == mex, the new MEX is mex +1.

But in the program, it's updating mex to mex - a_i when a_i >0, which is p_i < mex.

Wait, so when p_i < mex, mex remains the same.

When p_i >= mex, mex remains the same.

Wait, but in the code, it's only updating mex when mex > mex - a_i, which is when a_i >0.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent to updating mex to p_i when p_i < mex.

Wait, I'm getting tangled up.

Let me try to think about another test case.

Suppose n=1, a=[0]

Then, p=[0], since MEX(0)=1, a1=1-0=1, but according to the problem, a_i = MEX - p_i.

Wait, but in this case, a1=1-0=1, but the problem says a_i = MEX - p_i, and in this case, a=[0], which would imply MEX - p1=0, so MEX=p1.

But p1=0, MEX=1, which would make a1=1-0=1, but according to the input a=[0], which doesn't match.

Wait, but the problem says that the input is given in such a way that at least one valid p exists, so perhaps a=[0] is not possible for n=1.

Wait, for n=1, p=[0], a1=1-0=1, but if a=[0], then p1=1-0=1, but p1 must be 0, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I have a misunderstanding.

Wait, according to the problem, a_i = MEX(p1 to pi) - p_i.

For n=1, p1=0, MEX(p1)=1, so a1=1-0=1.

So, a=[1].

Similarly, for n=2:

p=[0,1], a1=1-0=1, a2=2-1=1, a=[1,1]

Or p=[1,0], a1=1-1=0, a2=2-0=2, a=[0,2]

So, for n=2, possible a are [1,1] and [0,2].

Given that, let's see what the program does.

Take a=[1,1], n=2.

res=[None,None], mex=2

i=1, a1=1, res[1]=2-1=1, mex=2>1, so mex=1

i=0, a0=1, res[0]=1-1=0, mex=1>0, so mex=0

So, res=[0,1], correct.

Another a=[0,2], n=2.

res=[None,None], mex=2

i=1, a1=2, res[1]=2-2=0, since mex=2 >0, mex=0

i=0, a0=0, res[0]=0-0=0, since 0>0 is False, mex remains 0

So, res=[0,0], but this is invalid because it's not a permutation.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's guaranteed that at least one valid p exists, but the input might allow multiple p.

Wait, in this case, p=[1,0] is a valid permutation with a=[0,2], but the program outputs [0,0], which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's guaranteed that at least one valid p exists, but perhaps the program doesn't always output the correct p.

Wait, but in this case, p=[1,0] is valid, but the program outputs [0,0], which is invalid.

So, is this a case where the program fails?

Wait, but the problem says that the input is given in such a way that at least one valid p exists, so perhaps a=[0,2] for n=2 is invalid because it doesn't correspond to any permutation.

Wait, but p=[1,0] gives a=[0,2], which seems valid.

Wait, let's check:

For p=[1,0], a1=MEX(1)=0-1= -1, but according to the problem, a_i = MEX - p_i.

Wait, MEX(p1 to pi) is MEX(1)=0, so a1=0-1= -1.

But in earlier examples, a_i = MEX - p_i, and in the first test case, a_i=1, which is MEX - p_i.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the first test case, a_i=1,1,-2,1,2, which corresponds to MEX - p_i.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm calculating a_i.

Wait, perhaps MEX is being considered differently.

Wait, perhaps MEX is the MEX of p1 to pi, which is correct.

But in the n=2, p=[1,0], a1=MEX(1)=0 -1= -1, a2=MEX(1,0)=2 -0=2, so a=[-1,2].

But in my earlier assumption, I thought a=[0,2], which is incorrect.

So, perhaps the problem has a_i >= -n, but in this case, a1=-1, which is allowed.

So, perhaps a=[-1,2] is possible, but a=[0,2] corresponds to p=[1,0], which gives a=[-1,2], not [0,2].

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, for p=[1,0], a1=0-1= -1, a2=2-0=2, so a=[-1,2].

So, a=[0,2] doesn't correspond to any p, hence if the input is a=[0,2], it's invalid.

But according to the problem, it's guaranteed that at least one valid p exists, so perhaps a=[0,2] is not possible.

Wait, but in the earlier test cases, a can be negative.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect because in some cases, it outputs invalid permutations.

Wait, in the earlier simulation with a=[1,1], it outputs [0,1], which is correct.

With a=[-1,2], it should output [1,0].

Let me simulate it:

n=2, a=[-1,2]

res=[None,None], mex=2

i=1, a1=2, res[1]=2-2=0, mex=2>0, so mex=0

i=0, a0=-1, res[0]=0 - (-1)=1, mex=0>1 is False, so mex remains 0

So, res=[1,0], which is correct.

Earlier, with a=[1,1], it output [0,1], which is correct.

With a=[0,2], which should correspond to p=[something], but according to earlier calculation, a=[0,2] would require p such that a1=0- p1=0, so p1=0, and a2= MEX(p1,p2) - p2= MEX(0,p2) - p2= (1 if p2!=1) - p2.

If p2=1, MEX=2, a2=2-1=1, which is not 2.

If p2=0, but p1=0, p2 must be different.

Wait, n=2, p must be permutation of [0,1].

If p=[0,1], a=[1,1]

If p=[1,0], a=[-1,2]

So, for a=[0,2], is there a p that satisfies?

Wait, suppose p=[something], but p must be a permutation of [0,1].

For p=[0,1], a=[1,1]

For p=[1,0], a=[-1,2]

So, a=[0,2] doesn't correspond to any p, but according to the problem, inputs are given such that at least one p exists, so a=[0,2] for n=2 is invalid.

Hence, perhaps the program is correct.

Wait, but in the simulation with a=[0,2], it outputs [0,0], which is invalid, but since a=[0,2] isn't supposed to be a valid input, the program might still be correct.

Wait, but the problem says that for the given inputs, at least one p exists, so we don't need to handle invalid a.

Hence, in such cases, we can assume that a corresponds to at least one p.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

Wait, but in the simulation with a=[0,2], which shouldn't be possible, the program outputs [0,0], which is invalid, but since such a shouldn't exist, it's acceptable.

Hence, perhaps the program is correct.

Let me think about another test case.

n=3, a=[-2,1,2]

Corresponding p=[2,0,1]

Verify:

- MEX(2)=0-2=-2

- MEX(2,0)=1-0=1

- MEX(2,0,1)=3-1=2

Which matches a.

Simulate the program:

res=[None,None,None], mex=3

i=2, a2=2, res[2]=3-2=1, mex=3>1, so mex=1

i=1, a1=1, res[1]=1-1=0, mex=1>0, so mex=0

i=0, a0=-2, res[0]=0 - (-2)=2, mex=0>2 is False, so mex remains 0

So, res=[2,0,1], correct.

Another test case:

n=4, a=[1,1,1,1]

Corresponding p=[0,1,2,3]

Verify:

- MEX(0)=1-0=1

- MEX(0,1)=2-1=1

- MEX(0,1,2)=3-2=1

- MEX(0,1,2,3)=4-3=1

Which matches a.

Simulate the program:

res=[None,None,None,None], mex=4

i=3, a3=1, res[3]=4-1=3, mex=4>3, so mex=3

i=2, a2=1, res[2]=3-1=2, mex=3>2, so mex=2

i=1, a1=1, res[1]=2-1=1, mex=2>1, so mex=1

i=0, a0=1, res[0]=1-1=0, mex=1>0, so mex=0

So, res=[0,1,2,3], correct.

Another test case:

n=4, a=[-1,0,1,2]

What should be p?

Let's calculate:

Suppose p=[1,0,3,2]

Verify:

- MEX(1)=0-1=-1

- MEX(1,0)=2-0=2, but a2=0, which doesn't match.

Wait, incorrect.

Wait, find p such that:

a1=MEX(p1)-p1=-1 => MEX(p1)=p1-1

a2=MEX(p1,p2)-p2=0

a3=MEX(p1,p2,p3)-p3=1

a4=MEX(p1,p2,p3,p4)-p4=2

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps p=[1,2,0,3]

Check:

- MEX(1)=0-1=-1 => a1=-1

- MEX(1,2)=0-2=-2 !=0

Wait, doesn't match a2=0.

Wait, perhaps p=[1,0,3,2]

Check:

- MEX(1)=0-1=-1 => a1=-1

- MEX(1,0)=2-0=2 !=0

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps p=[2,0,1,3]

Check:

- MEX(2)=0-2=-2 !=-1

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps p=[3,0,1,2]

Check:

- MEX(3)=0-3=-3 !=-1

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps p=[1,3,0,2]

Check:

- MEX(1)=0-1=-1 => a1=-1

- MEX(1,3)=0-3=-3 !=0

Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps a=[-1,0,1,2] doesn't correspond to any p, which would violate the problem's guarantee.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's guaranteed that at least one p exists for the given a.

So, perhaps a=[-1,0,1,2] isn't possible.

Hence, I can't use this as a test case.

Therefore, perhaps the program is correct.

Wait, but I need to make sure that for all possible valid a, the program outputs the correct p.

Given that, and considering the examples and simulations I've done, it seems that the program correctly reconstructs p from a.

Hence, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
