Alright, I've been assigned this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether it's possible to adjust the radii of given disks in a plane, under certain conditions, such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases, without causing any overlaps except for tangencies that already exist.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. We have n disks, each with integer coordinates for their centers and positive integer radii. No two disks overlap in a positive area, but they can be tangent to each other. The task is to see if we can change their radii in such a way that:

1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.

2. No two disks overlap in a positive area.

3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

The new radii can be any positive real numbers, and the centers remain fixed.

The output should be "YES" if it's possible to achieve this, and "NO" otherwise.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be written in Python, but there are some issues with the code presentation. It starts with a function call `func_1()` and then defines `func_1`. There are lists like `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` being used, and there's a `dfs` function defined inside `func_1` that seems to perform a depth-first search.

I need to understand what this code is doing and whether it correctly solves the problem as described.

First, I should note that the problem involves disks in a plane with integer coordinates and radii, and the constraints involve tangency and non-overlapping conditions.

From the problem statement, it seems like we need to model the relationships between the disks. Specifically, if two disks are tangent, they should remain tangent after adjusting their radii. Also, no two disks should overlap in a positive area after the adjustment.

I recall that in geometry, two circles are tangent if the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii (for externally tangent circles) or the absolute difference of their radii (for internally tangent circles). But in this problem, since radii are positive and centers are fixed, I believe we're dealing with external tangency, where the distance between centers equals the sum of radii.

Given that, the condition for two disks being tangent is that the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii.

Now, the problem allows us to change the radii as long as the tangency conditions are preserved and no new overlaps are created.

I need to think about what this implies.

If two disks are tangent, their sum of radii equals the distance between their centers. So, if we change one radius, we need to adjust the other accordingly to maintain that sum.

Wait, but the problem says that disks that were tangent remain tangent, and no two disks overlap in a positive area.

Moreover, the sum of all radii must strictly decrease.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints.

I need to find new radii for each disk such that:

- For every pair of tangent disks, their new radii sum to the distance between their centers.

- For every pair of non-tangent disks, their new radii do not sum to more than the distance between their centers.

- The sum of all new radii is strictly less than the sum of the original radii.

This sounds similar to a system of linear equations with inequality constraints.

In the code provided, it seems like the approach is to model this as a graph where disks are nodes, and tangent relationships are edges. Then, perform a depth-first search (DFS) to check some conditions.

Let me look closer at the code.

The code defines `func_1` which reads input values for n disks, their centers (x, y), and radii r.

It initializes arrays `visited`, `coef` with False and None respectively.

Then, it iterates through each disk and for each unvisited disk, it sets `coef[i] = 1`, initializes `tot = 0` and `bipartite = True`, and calls `dfs(i)`.

After the DFS, it checks if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not zero, and sets `ok` to True if so.

Finally, it prints "YES" if `ok` is True, else "NO".

The `dfs` function seems to perform a DFS traversal, marking nodes as visited, assigning `coef[j] = -coef[i]`, and recursively calling DFS on j.

It also checks for bipartiteness by ensuring that for each edge (i,j), `coef[j] == -coef[i]`.

Wait a minute, this seems like a standard algorithm to check if a graph is bipartite.

In graph theory, a graph is bipartite if its nodes can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two graph nodes connected by an edge are in the same set.

The way this is implemented is by assigning coefficients of 1 and -1 to nodes and ensuring that adjacent nodes have opposite coefficients.

But what does bipartiteness have to do with the problem of adjusting radii under the given constraints?

I need to think differently.

Maybe the problem can be modeled using graph theory, where disks are nodes, and edges represent tangency constraints.

If two disks are tangent, their radii must satisfy the condition r_i + r_j == d_ij, where d_ij is the distance between their centers.

For non-tangent disks, r_i + r_j <= d_ij to avoid positive area overlaps.

We need to find new radii that satisfy all these constraints and also have a strictly smaller sum than the original sum of radii.

This sounds like a system of linear equations and inequalities.

In particular, the tangency constraints are equality constraints, and the non-tangency constraints are inequality constraints.

To check if such a system has a solution where the sum of radii is strictly less than the original sum, we might need to use linear programming or some other optimization technique.

However, implementing such a thing from scratch in Python seems unlikely, especially given the constraints on n (up to 1000), which would make complex computations infeasible without optimization.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to be using a bipartite graph checking approach.

I wonder if there's a relationship between the bipartiteness of the tangency graph and the possibility of adjusting radii as required.

Perhaps if the tangency graph is bipartite, it's possible to adjust the radii in the desired manner.

But I'm not sure about that.

Let me consider some examples.

Take the first sample input:

5

0 2 1

0 0 1

4 -3 4

11 0 3

11 5 2

The output is "YES", meaning it's possible to adjust the radii as required.

Suppose I try to adjust the radii as suggested in the explanation: decrease the radii of the first and third disk by 0.5 and increase the second disk's radius by 0.5. This way, the sum decreases by 0.5.

I need to ensure that all tangency conditions are preserved and no new overlaps are created.

In this case, it seems to work.

Now, look at the second sample:

4

2 2 2

7 2 3

7 7 2

2 7 3

Output: "NO"

In this case, it's not possible to adjust the radii as required.

Looking at the code, it seems to perform a DFS to check if the tangency graph is bipartite and if some condition on `tot` is met.

But I need to understand why bipartiteness is relevant here.

Maybe the idea is to assign radii adjustments in such a way that for each connected component in the tangency graph, the adjustments form a valid system.

If the tangency graph is bipartite, it might be possible to adjust radii in a way that satisfies the conditions.

But I need to think more formally.

Let me consider the tangency constraints.

For two tangent disks i and j, we have r_i + r_j = d_ij, where d_ij is the fixed distance between centers.

These are equality constraints.

For non-tangent disks, r_i + r_j <= d_ij.

These are inequality constraints.

We need to find new r_i's that satisfy all these constraints and also sum(r_i) < sum(original r_i).

This seems like a system of linear equations and inequalities.

In linear programming terms, we can set up the problem to minimize the sum of r_i's under the given constraints and check if the minimum sum is strictly less than the original sum.

However, implementing a linear programming solver in Python for this problem seems unlikely, especially given the time constraints.

So perhaps there's a simpler way to approach this problem.

Let me consider the equality constraints first.

The equality constraints form a system of equations that can be represented as a graph, where disks are nodes and tangency relationships are edges.

Each edge corresponds to an equation r_i + r_j = d_ij.

I recall that in graph theory, if we have such equality constraints, we can fix the value of one variable and solve for the others in a connected component.

In this case, for a connected component, if we fix r_k in the component, then all other r_i's are determined by the equations.

But in this problem, radii can be any positive real numbers, so we have to ensure that all r_i's remain positive.

Moreover, we have the inequality constraints for non-adjacent pairs.

This seems complicated.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be checking if the tangency graph is bipartite.

If the tangency graph is bipartite, perhaps it's possible to adjust the radii in a way that satisfies the conditions.

But I need to verify this.

Suppose the tangency graph is bipartite.

Then, we can divide the disks into two sets, say A and B, such that all tangency edges are between A and B.

Then, perhaps we can decrease the radii of disks in A and increase the radii of disks in B accordingly, while maintaining the tangency conditions.

But we also need to ensure that no new overlaps are created, meaning that for non-adjacent disks, r_i + r_j <= d_ij.

Moreover, the sum of radii should strictly decrease.

I need to think about whether this is possible when the tangency graph is bipartite.

But first, I need to confirm if the provided code correctly checks for bipartiteness.

In the DFS function, it assigns `coef[j] = -coef[i]` for each adjacent node j of i.

This is a standard way to check bipartiteness.

If at any point it finds that `coef[j] != -coef[i]`, it sets `bipartite = False`.

So, it correctly checks if the graph is bipartite.

Now, the variable `tot` is incremented by `coef[i]` for each node visited.

I'm not sure what `tot` represents in this context.

Maybe it's related to the difference in the number of nodes in the two partitions.

But I need to understand its purpose.

In the problem, we need to check if it's possible to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases strictly, while maintaining tangency where it exists and no overlaps elsewhere.

The code seems to be checking if there's at least one connected component in the tangency graph that is bipartite and has `tot != 0`.

If such a component exists, it sets `ok = True`, and prints "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

I need to determine if this logic correctly solves the problem.

Let me consider a simple case.

Suppose there are two disks that are tangent to each other.

Their centers are at (0,0) and (2,0), with original radii 1 and 1.

So, d_ij = 2, and r_i + r_j = 2.

We need to adjust the radii such that r_i + r_j = 2, and sum(r_i) < 2.

This is only possible if we can set r_i and r_j such that r_i + r_j = 2 and r_i + r_j < 2, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't happen.

Wait, r_i + r_j = 2 and r_i + r_j < 2 is a contradiction.

So, in this case, it's impossible to adjust the radii as required.

Therefore, the program should output "NO".

According to the code, for two tangent disks, they form a connected component with two nodes.

In a bipartite graph with two nodes connected by an edge, it's bipartite, and `tot` would be 1 + (-1) = 0.

So, `tot == 0`, hence `ok` remains False, and it prints "NO", which is correct.

Now, consider three disks forming a triangle, all pairwise tangent.

This would form a connected component with three nodes and three edges.

In this case, the graph is not bipartite (since it's a cycle of odd length), so `bipartite` would be False, leading to `ok` being False, and output "NO".

But is this correct in the context of the problem?

In this scenario, with three disks all pairwise tangent, adjusting their radii while maintaining tangency is constrained.

Suppose the original radii are r1, r2, r3, with r1 + r2 = d12, r2 + r3 = d23, r1 + r3 = d13.

To adjust the radii, any changes must satisfy these equations.

This forms a system of equations:

r1 + r2 = d12

r2 + r3 = d23

r1 + r3 = d13

This system has a unique solution for r1, r2, r3, given the distances d12, d23, d13.

Therefore, there's only one possible set of radii that satisfy these tangency conditions.

If we cannot decrease the sum of radii in this case, then it's impossible, which aligns with the code's behavior (since the component is not bipartite, `ok` remains False).

Now, consider a graph where the tangency graph is bipartite.

In such a case, the code sets `ok` to True if `bipartite` is True and `tot != 0`.

But what is `tot`?

`tot` is the sum of `coef[i]` for all nodes in the component.

Since `coef[i]` is either 1 or -1, `tot` is the difference between the number of nodes in one partition and the other.

If the graph is bipartite, and the component has an unequal number of nodes in the two partitions, `tot` won't be zero.

In this case, it's possible to adjust the radii by increasing radii in one partition and decreasing in the other, while maintaining the tangency conditions.

This could potentially lead to a decrease in the sum of radii.

Hence, the code seems to be correctly identifying such scenarios.

Wait, but I need to think carefully.

Suppose we have a bipartite graph with partitions A and B, and |A| > |B|.

Then, `tot` would be |A| - |B| > 0.

In this case, we can decrease the radii of disks in A and increase the radii of disks in B accordingly, while maintaining the tangency conditions.

Moreover, since |A| > |B|, the total sum of radii can be decreased.

Similarly, if |B| > |A|, we can do the opposite.

This seems plausible.

However, we also need to ensure that no new overlaps are created, meaning that for non-adjacent disks, r_i + r_j <= d_ij.

This condition needs to be satisfied after adjusting the radii.

I'm not sure if the bipartite check alone ensures this.

Perhaps the problem assumes that the original configuration has no overlaps, and the adjustments only affect the radii in a way that maintains or reduces distances, but I need to verify this.

Looking back at the first sample input, which has output "YES", and the second has "NO", I need to see if the code correctly identifies these cases.

In the first sample, the tangency graph likely forms a bipartite graph with an unequal number of nodes in partitions, allowing for radii adjustments that decrease the sum.

In the second sample, perhaps the tangency graph is not bipartite, or the partitions are equal in size, making it impossible to decrease the sum while maintaining tangency and no overlaps.

Therefore, the code seems to be correctly implementing this logic.

But to be thorough, I need to think of potential counterexamples where the code might give incorrect results.

Suppose we have a tangency graph that is bipartite, with partitions of unequal size, and adjusting radii as described leads to new overlaps.

In such a case, the code would output "YES", but in reality, it's not possible without causing overlaps.

Is this possible?

Let me try to construct such a case.

Consider three disks forming a line, where disk A is tangent to disk B, and disk B is tangent to disk C, but A and C are not tangent.

The tangency graph is a path, which is bipartite.

Suppose partitions A and C are in one set, and B is in the other.

Then, |A| + |C| > |B|, so `tot != 0`.

According to the code, `ok` would be True, and it would output "YES".

But, if we decrease the radii of A and C and increase the radius of B, we need to ensure that A and C do not overlap each other after the adjustment.

Since A and C are not tangent, their new radii must satisfy r_A + r_C <= d_AC.

If, after adjusting the radii, r_A + r_C > d_AC, then they would overlap, which is not allowed.

Therefore, in such a case, even though the graph is bipartite and `tot != 0`, it might not be possible to adjust the radii without causing overlaps.

This suggests that the code's logic might be incomplete, as it doesn't check whether the adjusted radii satisfy the non-tangency constraints.

Hence, there might be cases where the code outputs "YES" but it's actually not possible to adjust the radii as required.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To confirm this, I need to find a specific example where the code says "YES" but it's actually "NO".

Let's construct such an example.

Consider three disks:

Disk A at (0,0) with r=1

Disk B at (2,0) with r=1

Disk C at (4,0) with r=1

Tangencies:

A is tangent to B (distance 2, r_A + r_B = 2)

B is tangent to C (distance 2, r_B + r_C = 2)

A and C are not tangent (distance 4, r_A + r_C <= 4)

The tangency graph is a path: A-B-C, which is bipartite.

Partitions: A and C in one set, B in the other.

`tot = 1 (A) + (-1) (B) + 1 (C) = 1 != 0`

So, the code would set `ok = True` and output "YES".

Now, let's see if it's actually possible to adjust the radii.

Let’s say we decrease r_A and r_C by some amount, and increase r_B by another amount, while maintaining the tangency conditions:

r_A + r_B = 2

r_B + r_C = 2

Suppose we set r_A = 0.5, r_C = 0.5, then r_B = 1.5 to satisfy r_B + r_C = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5.

But then, r_A + r_C = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1, which is less than d_AC = 4, so no overlap.

Moreover, the sum of radii is 0.5 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 2.5, which is less than the original sum of 3.

Wait, but in this case, it seems possible.

Maybe I need to adjust the radii more drastically.

Suppose we set r_A = 0.1, r_C = 0.1, then r_B = 1.9.

Sum of radii is 0.1 + 1.9 + 0.1 = 2.1, which is less than original sum of 3.

And r_A + r_C = 0.2 < d_AC = 4, so no overlap.

Seems fine.

Is there a way to make it invalid?

Let’s try setting r_A = 0.5, r_C = 0.5, r_B = 1.5 as before.

Sum is 2.5 < 3.

No overlap between A and C.

Seems valid.

Wait, maybe I need to think of a different configuration.

Let’s consider four disks:

A at (0,0) with r=1

B at (2,0) with r=1

C at (4,0) with r=1

D at (6,0) with r=1

Tangencies:

A-B, B-C, C-D

Tangency graph: A-B-C-D, a path, which is bipartite.

Partitions: A and C in one set, B and D in the other.

`tot = 1 (A) + (-1) (B) + 1 (C) + (-1) (D) = 0`

In this case, `tot == 0`, so `ok` remains False, and output "NO".

But according to the earlier logic, we can adjust radii by decreasing A and C, increasing B and D, while maintaining the tangency conditions.

For example:

Set r_A = 0.5, r_C = 0.5, r_B = 1.5, r_D = 1.5

Sum is 0.5 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 1.5 = 4 < original sum of 4.

But wait, original sum is 4, new sum is also 4, which is not strictly less.

Wait, 0.5 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 1.5 = 4, which is not strictly less than original sum of 4.

Wait, but in the code, if `tot == 0`, then `ok` remains False, which is correct in this case because we cannot strictly decrease the sum.

Hence, the code correctly identifies this case as "NO".

So, in this case, the code is correct.

But earlier, in the three-disk example, `tot != 0`, so `ok = True`, and it's actually possible to decrease the sum strictly.

Hence, the code seems correct in these cases.

Let me think of another scenario.

Suppose we have a cycle with four disks:

A at (0,0), r=1

B at (2,0), r=1

C at (2,2), r=1

D at (0,2), r=1

Tangencies: A-B, B-C, C-D, D-A

This forms a cycle, which is bipartite since it's a cycle of even length.

Partitions: A and C in one set, B and D in the other.

`tot = 1 (A) + (-1) (B) + 1 (C) + (-1) (D) = 0`

Hence, `ok` remains False, and output "NO".

In this case, is it possible to adjust radii to strictly decrease the sum?

Given the constraints:

r_A + r_B = 2

r_B + r_C = 2

r_C + r_D = 2

r_D + r_A = 2

This system implies that r_A = r_C and r_B = r_D.

Hence, the sum s = 2*r_A + 2*r_B

From the equations, r_A + r_B = 2

Hence, s = 2*(r_A + r_B) = 4

So, the sum is always 4, cannot be decreased.

Hence, "NO" is the correct output, which matches the code's behavior.

Another example: a star shape with one central disk tangent to several others.

Suppose one central disk E at (0,0) with r=1, and four surrounding disks A at (1,0), B at (0,1), C at (-1,0), D at (0,-1), each with r=1, tangent to E and to their neighbors.

Tangencies: E-A, E-B, E-C, E-D, A-B, B-C, C-D, D-A

This forms a graph where E is connected to A, B, C, D, and A, B, C, D are connected in a cycle.

This graph is not bipartite because there are odd cycles (the cycle A-B-C-D-A).

Hence, the code would set `bipartite = False`, `ok` remains False, output "NO".

In this case, it's not possible to adjust radii to strictly decrease the sum while maintaining tangency and no overlaps.

Hence, the code is correct again.

Wait, but in this configuration, is it really impossible to decrease the sum?

Let's see.

From the tangency conditions:

r_E + r_A = 2

r_E + r_B = 2

r_E + r_C = 2

r_E + r_D = 2

r_A + r_B = sqrt(2)^2 = 2

Similarly for r_B + r_C, r_C + r_D, r_D + r_A.

From r_E + r_A = 2 and r_A + r_B = 2, and r_B + r_C = 2, and r_C + r_D = 2, and r_D + r_A = 2.

This system implies that r_A = r_B = r_C = r_D, and r_E = 2 - r_A.

Then, sum s = r_E + 4*r_A = (2 - r_A) + 4*r_A = 2 + 3*r_A

To minimize s, we need to minimize r_A, but r_A must be positive.

Original sum is with r_A = 1, s = 2 + 3*1 = 5.

If we set r_A = epsilon > 0, then s = 2 + 3*epsilon, which is strictly less than 5 as epsilon approaches 0.

But, we need to check if this satisfies all tangency conditions and no overlaps.

Wait, but r_A must be positive, and r_E = 2 - r_A > 0, so r_A < 2.

Hence, s can be made arbitrarily close to 2, by setting r_A very small.

But in this case, the sum s = 2 + 3*r_A can be made less than 5, yes.

Wait, but according to the code, since the graph is not bipartite, it would output "NO", but in reality, it seems possible to decrease the sum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in modeling the constraints.

Wait, in this configuration, besides the tangency constraints, we have to ensure that non-tangent disks do not overlap.

In this case, for example, A and C are not directly tangent (assuming they are only tangent to E and their neighbors), so r_A + r_C <= d_Ac = 2.

Given that r_A = r_C, we have 2*r_A <= 2, so r_A <=1.

Similarly, r_A + r_C <=2, which is already satisfied since r_A <=1.

Hence, in this case, s = 2 + 3*r_A, with r_A <=1.

So, the minimal sum is when r_A approaches 0, s approaches 2.

Hence, it's possible to decrease the sum from 5 to arbitrarily close to 2.

But according to the code, since the graph is not bipartite, it would output "NO", which is incorrect in this case.

Hence, this seems to be a counterexample where the code outputs "NO" but it should be "YES".

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in this configuration, the tangency graph is not bipartite because of the odd cycle, so the code correctly outputs "NO".

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be possible to decrease the sum.

Is there a mistake in my reasoning?

Wait, perhaps I need to check the tangency constraints more carefully.

Given that A is tangent to E and to B and to D, similarly for the others.

The tangency graph is E connected to A,B,C,D, and A,B,C,D form a cycle.

This graph is not bipartite because of the odd cycle A-B-C-D-A.

Hence, the code correctly identifies it as "NO".

But is it really impossible to decrease the sum?

Wait, perhaps not.

Given the constraints:

r_E + r_A = 2

r_E + r_B = 2

r_E + r_C = 2

r_E + r_D = 2

r_A + r_B = 2

r_B + r_C = 2

r_C + r_D = 2

r_D + r_A = 2

From these, we can see that r_A = r_B = r_C = r_D, and r_E = 2 - r_A.

Then, sum s = r_E + 4*r_A = (2 - r_A) + 4*r_A = 2 + 3*r_A

To minimize s, we need to minimize r_A, but r_A must be positive.

Hence, s can be made arbitrarily close to 2, but never equal to or less than 2, since r_A >0.

But in the problem statement, radii can be arbitrary positive real numbers, so we can set r_A to be arbitrarily small, making s arbitrarily close to 2.

However, s can never be less than 2, because as r_A approaches 0, s approaches 2.

Hence, it's not possible to have s < 5 in this case, because s approaches 2, which is less than 5, but the minimal sum is 2, which is less than 5.

Wait, but in the original configuration, sum is 5, and we can adjust to sum arbitrarily close to 2, which is strictly less than 5.

Hence, it should be "YES", but the code outputs "NO".

Therefore, the code is incorrect in this case.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I miscounted the sum.

Original sum is r_E + r_A + r_B + r_C + r_D = (2 - r_A) + 4*r_A = 2 + 3*r_A

With r_A =1, s=5.

If we set r_A = epsilon, s=2 + 3*epsilon, which is less than 5 for any epsilon >0.

Hence, s can be made less than 5.

But according to the code, since the graph is not bipartite, it outputs "NO", which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
