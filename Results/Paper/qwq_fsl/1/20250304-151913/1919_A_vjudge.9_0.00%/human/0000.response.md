Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

Let's start by understanding the problem and the provided program.

### Problem Description

Alice and Bob are playing a game with their wallets containing coins. Alice has `a` coins, and Bob has `b` coins. They take turns, with Alice starting first. In each turn, the player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep the current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. Both play optimally.

### Program Code

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

### Analysis

The program seems straightforward. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, passes them to `func_1`, and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results.

The logic in `func_1` is that if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

### Task

I need to determine if this logic is correct for all possible values of `a` and `b`. If there's any case where this logic fails, then the program is incorrect.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Game Mechanics:**
   - Players alternate turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep the current one, then remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game continues until a player cannot make a move (i.e., their current wallet has 0 coins and they choose not to swap).

2. **Determine the Winning Strategy:**
   - Since both play optimally, we need to find a pattern or mathematical relationship that determines the winner based on the initial values of `a` and `b`.

3. **Verify the Provided Logic:**
   - The provided program claims that if `a + b` is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
   - I need to verify if this is always true.

### Step-by-Step Verification

1. **Base Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** `a = 1, b = 1`
     - According to the program: `1 + 1 = 2` (even), so Bob wins.
     - According to the example output: Bob
     - Matches.
   - **Case 2:** `a = 1, b = 4`
     - According to the program: `1 + 4 = 5` (odd), so Alice wins.
     - According to the example output: Alice
     - Matches.

2. **General Pattern:**
   - The program suggests that the sum of `a` and `b` determines the winner.
   - I need to see if this holds for more cases.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 3:** `a = 0, b = 1`
     - Alice cannot make a move initially since her wallet has 0 coins. So, Bob wins.
     - According to the program: `0 + 1 = 1` (odd), so Alice wins.
     - This contradicts the expected outcome. Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait a minute, but in the problem statement, it says "both players have at least 1 coin". So, `a` and `b` are at least 1. Therefore, `a = 0` might not be a valid input.

Let me check the problem description again:

"1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9"

So, both `a` and `b` are at least 1. Therefore, the case `a = 0` is invalid.

4. **Other Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 4:** `a = 1, b = 1`
     - As above, matches.
   - **Case 5:** `a = 2, b = 2`
     - Sum is 4 (even), so Bob wins.
     - Let's simulate:
       - Alice's turn: swap or not. If she swaps, a=2, b=2. She removes 1, a=1, b=2.
       - Bob's turn: swap or not. If he swaps, a=2, b=1. He removes 1, a=2, b=0.
       - Alice's turn: swap or not. If she swaps, a=0, b=2. She cannot remove from a=0, so she loses.
       - So, Bob wins.
     - Matches the program's output.
   - **Case 6:** `a = 2, b = 3`
     - Sum is 5 (odd), so Alice wins.
     - Let's simulate:
       - Alice's turn: swap or not. If she swaps, a=3, b=2. She removes 1, a=3, b=1.
       - Bob's turn: swap or not. If he swaps, a=1, b=3. He removes 1, a=0, b=3.
       - Alice's turn: swap or not. If she swaps, a=3, b=0. She removes 1, a=2, b=0.
       - Bob's turn: swap or not. If he swaps, a=0, b=2. He cannot remove from a=0, so he loses.
       - So, Alice wins.
     - Matches the program's output.

5. **Large Values:**
   - **Case 7:** `a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000`
     - Sum is 2000000000 (even), so Bob wins.
     - According to the example output: Bob
     - Matches.

6. **Different Parity:**
   - **Case 8:** `a = 5, b = 3`
     - Sum is 8 (even), so Bob wins.
     - According to the example output: Bob
     - Matches.
   - **Case 9:** `a = 4, b = 5`
     - Sum is 9 (odd), so Alice wins.
     - According to the example output: Alice
     - Matches.

7. **One Player Has Only One Coin:**
   - **Case 10:** `a = 1, b = 4`
     - Sum is 5 (odd), so Alice wins.
     - According to the example output: Alice
     - Matches.

### Conclusion

After testing multiple cases, including base cases, edge cases, and large values, the program's logic seems to hold. The sum of `a` and `b` determines the winner correctly in all tested scenarios.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{True}}\]
