You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given n positive integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n and three positive
integers n_a, n_b, n_c satisfying n_a+n_b+n_c = n .

You want to split the n positive integers into three groups, so that:

  * The first group contains n_a numbers, the second group contains n_b numbers, the third group contains n_c numbers.
  * Let s_a be the sum of the numbers in the first group, s_b be the sum in the second group, and s_c be the sum in the third group. Then s_a, s_b, s_c are the sides of a triangle with positive area.

Determine if this is possible. If this is possible, find one way to do so.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1\le t\le 100\,000 ) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the t
test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains the integers n, n_a, n_b, n_c (3
\leq n \leq 200\,000, 1\leq n_a,n_b,n_c \leq n-2, n_a+n_b+n_c = n ) — the
number of integers to split into three groups, and the desired sizes of the
three groups.

The second line of each test case contains n integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n (1
\leq x_i \leq 10^{9} ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed
200\,000 .

Output

For each test case, print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to split the numbers
into three groups satisfying all the conditions. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO}
.

If such a split exists, then describe the three groups as follows.

On the next line, print n_a integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n_a} — the numbers
in the first group.

On the next line, print n_b integers b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{n_b} — the numbers
in the second group.

On the next line, print n_c integers c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{n_c} — the numbers
in the third group.

These n_a+n_b+n_c=n integers should be a permutation of x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n
, and they should satisfy the conditions from the statement.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    6 2 2 2
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5 3 1 1
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    6 2 2 2
    
    1 1 1 1 1 3
    
    8 1 2 5
    
    16 1 1 1 1 1 1 12

Output

    YES
    1 1 
    1 1 
    1 1 
    NO
    NO
    YES
    16 
    12 1 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, we can put two 1 s into each group: the sum in each
group would be 2 , and there exists a triangle with positive area and sides 2
, 2 , 2 .

In the second and third test cases, it can be shown that there is no such way
to split numbers into groups.

In the fourth test case, we can put number 16 into the first group, with sum
16 , numbers 12 and 1 into the second group, with sum 13 , and the remaining
five 1 s into the third group, with sum 5 , as there exists a triangle with
positive area and sides 16, 13, 5 .
Program:
```
t = int(input())
out = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, na, nb, nc) = map(int, input().split())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_2(n, na, nb, nc, x)
    if result == 'NO':
        out.append('NO')
    else:
        out.append(['YES', result[1], result[2], result[3]])
for result in out:
    if result == 'NO':
        print(result)
    else:
        print(result[0])
        for group in result[1:]:
            print(' '.join(map(str, group)))

def func_1(a, b, c):
    return a + b > c and a + c > b and (b + c > a)

def func_2(n, na, nb, nc, numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    (group_a, group_b, group_c) = ([], [], [])
    (sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) = (0, 0, 0)

    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c):
        return ('YES', group_a, group_b, group_c)
    else:
        return 'NO'

def distribute_number(num):
    nonlocal sum_a, sum_b, sum_c
    if len(group_a) < na or (len(group_a) == na and sum_a <= min(sum_b, sum_c)):
        group_a.append(num)
        sum_a += num
    elif len(group_b) < nb or (len(group_b) == nb and sum_b <= min(sum_a, sum_c)):
        group_b.append(num)
        sum_b += num
    else:
        group_c.append(num)
        sum_c += num


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
