Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

Let's start by understanding the problem description. Bob has a rectangle of size a × b. He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle using these two smaller rectangles, possibly rotating them. The goal is to determine if he can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90° rotation are considered the same.

The program provided is supposed to handle multiple test cases, each with two integers a and b representing the dimensions of the rectangle. For each test case, it should output "Yes" if Bob can form another rectangle, and "No" otherwise.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. Let's break it down:

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:** Bob can make a cut parallel to one of the sides, meaning he can either cut along the length or the width.

   - If he cuts parallel to the width, he gets two rectangles of size a × (b - k), where k is the length of the cut.

   - If he cuts parallel to the length, he gets two rectangles of size (a - k) × b.

2. **Forming a New Rectangle:** From the two smaller rectangles, Bob can arrange them to form a new rectangle. He can rotate these smaller rectangles as he wishes.

The key point is to determine if the two smaller rectangles can be arranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rotations don't create distinct rectangles.

Let's consider some examples to understand this better.

**Example 1:**

- Input: 1 1

- Output: No

Explanation: A 1×1 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles because the smallest cut would result in at least one rectangle having a dimension of zero, which is invalid.

**Example 2:**

- Input: 2 1

- Output: No

Explanation: Cutting a 2×1 rectangle results in two 1×1 rectangles. These can only be arranged to form a 1×2 or 2×1 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

**Example 3:**

- Input: 2 6

- Output: Yes

Explanation: Cutting a 2×6 rectangle into two 2×3 rectangles allows forming a 4×3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2×6.

From these examples, it seems that the program needs to check if it's possible to cut the rectangle in such a way that the two resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it correctly implements this logic.

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

This function reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the dimensions a and b. It then applies a series of conditions to decide whether to print "yes" or "no".

Let's analyze these conditions one by one.

1. **if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:**

   - If both a and b are even, it prints "yes".

   - This suggests that if both dimensions are even, it's possible to form a new rectangle.

2. **elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):**

   - This condition seems problematic. The expressions (a - b == -a, a) and (b - a == -b, b) are tuples, and checking if a tuple is truthy doesn't make much sense in this context.

   - Perhaps this was intended to check if a - b equals -a or a, and similarly for b - a, but it's not written correctly.

3. **elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:**

   - This checks if the difference (a - b) modulo 2 is greater than 0 or less than 0.

   - However, the modulo operation always returns a non-negative number, so (a - b) % 2 is either 0 or 1.

   - Therefore, (a - b) % 2 > 0 is possible, but (a - b) % 2 < 0 is never true, since modulo results are non-negative.

4. **else:**

   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "no".

Given these observations, the program seems to have logical flaws, particularly in the second condition. I need to determine if these flaws affect the correctness of the program.

To verify the program's correctness, I should consider various test cases and see if the program's output matches the expected result based on the problem description.

Let's consider the examples provided in the problem description:

1. **Input: 1 1**

   - Expected Output: No

   - Program's Behavior: Both a and b are odd, so it goes to the else clause and prints "no". Correct.

2. **Input: 2 1**

   - Expected Output: No

   - Program's Behavior: a is even, b is odd, so it doesn't match the first condition. The second condition is unclear, but assuming it's incorrect, it might fall through to the else clause and print "no". Correct in this case, but not necessarily generalizable.

3. **Input: 2 6**

   - Expected Output: Yes

   - Program's Behavior: Both a and b are even, so it prints "yes". Correct.

4. **Input: 3 2**

   - Expected Output: Yes

   - Program's Behavior: a is odd, b is even. It doesn't match the first condition. The second condition is unclear, but assuming it's incorrect, it might reach the third condition. (3 - 2) % 2 = 1 > 0, so it prints "yes". Correct.

5. **Input: 2 2**

   - Expected Output: Yes

   - Program's Behavior: Both a and b are even, so it prints "yes". Correct.

6. **Input: 2 4**

   - Expected Output: Yes

   - Program's Behavior: Both a and b are even, so it prints "yes". Correct.

7. **Input: 6 3**

   - Expected Output: No

   - Program's Behavior: a is even, b is odd, so it doesn't match the first condition. The second condition is unclear, but assuming it's incorrect, it might fall through to the else clause and print "no". Correct in this case.

From these examples, the program seems to produce the correct output. However, I need to consider more edge cases to ensure its correctness.

Let's think about some additional test cases:

**Test Case 1:**

- Input: 1 2

- Expected Output: No

  - Cutting a 1×2 rectangle results in two 1×1 rectangles, which can only form a 1×2 or 2×1 rectangle, same as the original.

- Program's Behavior: a is odd, b is even. It doesn't match the first condition. The second condition is unclear, but assuming it's incorrect, it might reach the third condition. (1 - 2) % 2 = 1 > 0, so it prints "yes". This is incorrect; it should print "no".

Wait, according to the program, for input 1 2, it should print "yes" based on the third condition, but according to the problem, it should print "no". This is a discrepancy.

**Test Case 2:**

- Input: 3 3

- Expected Output: Yes

  - Cutting a 3×3 square into two 3×1.5 rectangles is not possible since dimensions must be integers. So, it can't be cut into two integer-sided rectangles, hence "No".

  - Wait, but according to the problem, cutting a 1×1 rectangle is invalid, but for 3×3, cutting into two 3×1 rectangles is possible. From two 3×1 rectangles, you can form a 1×6 or 2×3 rectangle, which is different from the original 3×3.

  - So, expected output should be "Yes".

- Program's Behavior: Both a and b are odd, so it goes to the else clause and prints "no". This is incorrect; it should print "Yes".

Another discrepancy.

**Test Case 3:**

- Input: 4 4

- Expected Output: Yes

- Program's Behavior: Both a and b are even, so it prints "yes". Correct.

**Test Case 4:**

- Input: 5 2

- Expected Output: No

  - Cutting a 5×2 rectangle into two 5×1 rectangles. From these, you can form a 5×2 or 2×5 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

- Program's Behavior: a is odd, b is even. It doesn't match the first condition. The second condition is unclear, but assuming it's incorrect, it might reach the third condition. (5 - 2) % 2 = 1 > 0, so it prints "yes". This is incorrect; it should print "no".

Yet another discrepancy.

From these additional test cases, it's clear that the program doesn't handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the third condition is flawed because (a - b) % 2 > 0 will be true in many cases where the program should actually print "no".

Moreover, the second condition is poorly written and doesn't seem to serve any logical purpose in this context.

Given these observations, I can conclude that the program is incorrect because there are cases where it produces the wrong output.

**Correctness: False**

**Explanation:**

The program incorrectly classifies some cases where it should print "no" as "yes". For example, for input 1 2, it prints "yes" but should print "no". Similarly, for input 3 3, it prints "no" but should print "yes". These discrepancies indicate that the program does not correctly implement the required logic for all possible cases.

**Suggested Improvement:**

To correctly solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

A correct approach would involve checking if there exists a way to split either dimension into two parts such that the resulting smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is not equivalent to the original one under rotation.

One way to achieve this is:

1. Check if either dimension is even.

2. If both dimensions are even, it's always possible to form a new rectangle.

3. If one dimension is even and the other is odd, check if the even dimension can be split in a way that allows forming a new rectangle.

4. If both dimensions are odd, it's generally not possible to form a new rectangle, except for specific cases where the rectangles can be rotated and arranged differently.

However, a more precise condition needs to be derived to handle all cases correctly.

Given the time constraints, I'll stop here and conclude that the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
