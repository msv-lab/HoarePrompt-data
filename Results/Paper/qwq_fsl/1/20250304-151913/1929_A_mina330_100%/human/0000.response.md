Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible input case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

Let's start by understanding the problem and the provided program.

### Problem Description

Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange the array to maximize its "beauty." The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.

My task is to determine if the given program correctly achieves this goal for any input that adheres to the specified constraints.

### Provided Program

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

### Approach to Verification

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the array after rearrangement.
   - The array can be rearranged in any order.
   - Constraints:
     - Number of test cases, t: 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
     - Array length, n: 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
     - Array elements, a_i: 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9

2. **Analyze the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - Reads the array length, n.
     - Reads the array elements.
     - Sorts the array.
     - Prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array.

3. **Determine if the Program Meets the Requirements:**
   - Need to verify if sorting the array and taking the difference between the maximum and minimum elements always yields the maximum possible beauty as defined.

### Detailed Analysis

First, let's understand what the beauty of the array is.

The beauty is defined as:

\[
\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) = a_n - a_1
\]

So, the beauty is simply \(a_n - a_1\), where \(a_n\) is the last element in the rearranged array and \(a_1\) is the first element.

Given this, the program's approach of sorting the array and taking the difference between the last and first elements seems correct.

Wait, but let's verify this step by step.

#### Step-by-Step Verification

1. **Sum Simplification:**
   - The sum \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\) telescopes to \(a_n - a_1\).
   - Therefore, the beauty is always \(a_n - a_1\) regardless of the arrangement.

2. **Rearrangement Impact:**
   - Since the beauty depends only on the first and last elements after rearrangement, the order of the middle elements doesn't affect the beauty.

3. **Program's Approach:**
   - The program sorts the array and computes the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is \(a_{\text{max}} - a_{\text{min}}\).
   - This seems to align with the simplified beauty formula.

4. **Potential Misunderstandings:**
   - One might think that arranging the array in a specific order could yield a higher beauty, but the telescoping sum shows that it only depends on the first and last elements.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - All elements are the same: beauty should be 0, which matches \(a_{\text{max}} - a_{\text{min}} = 0\).
   - Array with two elements: beauty is simply the difference between them.
   - Array with elements in any order: the beauty is always the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

Given this analysis, it seems the program correctly captures the essence of the problem.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the problem description, understanding the requirements, and analyzing the provided program, I conclude that the program correctly achieves the goal for every possible input case within the specified constraints.

Therefore, the correctness is **True**.

**Explanation:**

The beauty of the array, as defined, simplifies to the difference between the last and first elements in the rearranged array. The program sorts the array and computes this difference, which aligns with the simplified formula. Since this approach holds for all possible inputs within the given constraints, the program is correct.
