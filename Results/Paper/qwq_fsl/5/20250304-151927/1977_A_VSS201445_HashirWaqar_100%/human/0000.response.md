Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. I need to determine whether the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". The key here is to ensure that the program works for every potential case, and if it fails even for a single case, it's considered incorrect.

I've been given three examples to understand how this works. Let's look at them one by one.

**Example 1:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:

  ```python

  def is_not_prime(n):

      if n < 2:

          return True

      for i in range(2, n):

          if n % i == 0:

              return True

      return False

  ```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **True**

  So, in this case, the function is supposed to identify non-prime numbers. The function returns True for numbers less than 2 and for numbers that have divisors other than 1 and themselves. For prime numbers, it returns False. This seems correct based on the problem description.

**Example 2:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with the same characters.

- Program:

  ```python

  def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):

      count = 0

      for i in range(len(s)-1):

          for j in range(i, len(s)-1):

              if s[i] == s[j+1]:

                  count += 1

      return count

  ```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**

  Here, the function is supposed to count substrings that start and end with the same character. However, the program seems to have a logical error in the loops. It's possible that it's not counting all possible substrings correctly, especially those of length 1. This might be why it's considered incorrect.

**Example 3:**

- Problem Description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in a list.

- Program:

  ```python

  def binary_search(arr, target):

      left = 0

      right = len(arr) - 1

      while left < right:

          mid = (left + right) // 2

          if arr[mid] == target:

              return mid

          elif arr[mid] < target:

              left = mid

          else:

              right = mid - 1

      if arr[left] == target:

          return left

      return -1

  ```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**

  In this binary search implementation, there might be an issue with the way the search space is halved. Specifically, when arr[mid] < target, setting left = mid might not be correct because mid could still be equal to left. This could lead to an infinite loop or incorrect results. Hence, it's marked as incorrect.

From these examples, I understand that I need to thoroughly check if the given program adheres to the problem description for all possible cases. Even a single case where it fails will make the entire program incorrect.

Now, moving on to my task:

**Problem Description:**

- Nikita has some cubes and wants to build a tower using them.

- Initially, the tower has no cubes.

- In one move, Nikita can either add one cube to the top or remove one cube from the top.

- After n moves, we need to check if it's possible to have exactly m cubes in the tower.

- Input: t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), each with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

- Output: For each test case, output "Yes" if it's possible to have m cubes after n moves, otherwise "No".

**Given Program:**

```python

def func():

    for _ in range(int(input())):

        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())

        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:

            print('YES')

        else:

            print('NO')

```

I need to verify if this program correctly determines whether it's possible to have m cubes after n moves.

First, I need to understand the logic behind the problem.

- Each move can either add or remove one cube.

- We need to see if, after n moves, we can end up with exactly m cubes.

Let's think about this step by step.

1. **Maximum cubes possible:** If Nikita adds a cube in every move, the maximum number of cubes he can have is n.

2. **Minimum cubes possible:** If Nikita removes a cube in every move, starting from 0, he can't have negative cubes, so the minimum is 0.

3. **Possible values:** Since each move can add or remove one cube, the number of cubes can fluctuate. However, the key is to see the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference between n and m.

Let's consider the difference between n and m: d = n - m.

- If d is even, it might be possible, depending on the values.

- If d is odd, it might not be possible.

But I need to verify this properly.

Let's consider some examples:

**Test Case 1:**

- n = 3, m = 3

- Possible sequence: Add, Add, Add

- Result: 3 cubes

- Output: Yes

**Test Case 2:**

- n = 2, m = 4

- Possible sequence: Add, Add, Add, Add (but only 2 moves allowed)

- Wait, but he can only make 2 moves.

- Maximum cubes possible is 2 (Add, Add)

- So, m = 4 is impossible with n = 2 moves.

- Output: No

**Test Case 3:**

- n = 5, m = 3

- One possible sequence: Add, Add, Add, Remove, Add

- After 5 moves: 3 cubes

- Output: Yes

Now, looking at the given program:

- It checks if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0.

- If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES'; else, 'NO'.

Let's see if this logic holds.

**Condition Analysis:**

1. **n >= m:** This makes sense because to have m cubes after n moves, the maximum cubes you can have is n (by adding in every move). So, m cannot be greater than n.

2. **(n - m) % 2 == 0:** This seems to check the parity of the difference between n and m.

Let's understand why this condition is necessary.

- Each add operation increases the cube count by 1.

- Each remove operation decreases the cube count by 1, but only if there is at least one cube.

- So, the net effect of one add and one remove is zero change in cube count.

- Therefore, the difference between n (total moves) and m (final cubes) should be even because each pair of add and remove operations cancels out.

Wait, but this needs more thought.

Let's consider:

- Let a be the number of add operations.

- Let r be the number of remove operations.

- Then, a + r = n (total moves)

- The final number of cubes is a - r (since each add increases by 1 and each remove decreases by 1)

- We want a - r = m

- From a + r = n and a - r = m, we can solve for a and r.

- Adding the two equations: 2a = n + m => a = (n + m)/2

- Subtracting the two equations: 2r = n - m => r = (n - m)/2

- For a and r to be integers (since you can't have fractional operations), both (n + m) and (n - m) must be even.

But the given program only checks if (n - m) is even and n >= m.

Is this sufficient?

Let's see.

- If n - m is even, then r = (n - m)/2 is an integer.

- Also, a = (n + m)/2 should be an integer.

- So, for both a and r to be integers, (n + m) should also be even.

- But the given program doesn't check if (n + m) is even.

Wait, but if n - m is even, and n + m is even, then both a and r are integers.

If n - m is even, but n + m is odd, then a and r would not be integers.

But in this case, the program would still consider it valid, which might not be correct.

Wait, no. Let's think differently.

- If n - m is even, and n >= m, then both a and r are integers.

- Because a = (n + m)/2 and r = (n - m)/2.

- If n - m is even, and n >= m, then both a and r are integers.

- Hence, it should be correct.

But let's verify with some test cases.

**Test Case 4:**

- n = 4, m = 2

- n - m = 2, which is even.

- a = (4 + 2)/2 = 3

- r = (4 - 2)/2 = 1

- Total moves: 3 add + 1 remove = 4 moves

- Final cubes: 3 - 1 = 2

- Output: Yes

**Test Case 5:**

- n = 3, m = 2

- n - m = 1, which is odd.

- Program would say No.

- Let's see:

- a + r = 3

- a - r = 2

- Solving: a = 2.5, r = 0.5

- Not integers, so not possible.

- Indeed, not possible in reality.

**Test Case 6:**

- n = 5, m = 1

- n - m = 4, which is even.

- a = (5 + 1)/2 = 3

- r = (5 - 1)/2 = 2

- Total moves: 3 add + 2 remove = 5 moves

- Final cubes: 3 - 2 = 1

- Output: Yes

**Test Case 7:**

- n = 1, m = 1

- n - m = 0, which is even.

- a = (1 + 1)/2 = 1

- r = (1 - 1)/2 = 0

- Total moves: 1 add + 0 remove = 1 move

- Final cubes: 1 - 0 = 1

- Output: Yes

**Test Case 8:**

- n = 1, m = 0

- n - m = 1, which is odd.

- Program says No.

- Let's see:

- a + r = 1

- a - r = 0

- Solving: a = 0.5, r = 0.5

- Not integers, not possible.

- Indeed, not possible because with one move, you can either add or remove, but starting from 0, you can't remove, so only option is to add one cube.

- So, m = 0 is not achievable in one move.

- Output: No

**Test Case 9:**

- n = 2, m = 0

- n - m = 2, which is even.

- a = (2 + 0)/2 = 1

- r = (2 - 0)/2 = 1

- Total moves: 1 add + 1 remove = 2 moves

- Final cubes: 1 - 1 = 0

- Output: Yes

**Test Case 10:**

- n = 3, m = 3

- n - m = 0, which is even.

- a = (3 + 3)/2 = 3

- r = (3 - 3)/2 = 0

- Total moves: 3 add + 0 remove = 3 moves

- Final cubes: 3 - 0 = 3

- Output: Yes

**Test Case 11:**

- n = 3, m = 4

- n - m = -1, which is odd.

- Program would say No.

- Indeed, not possible because n < m.

- Output: No

Wait, but n can be less than m, as long as n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0.

Wait, if n < m, then n - m is negative, but if it's even, the program would still say Yes.

But is that possible?

Let's see.

**Test Case 12:**

- n = 2, m = 4

- n - m = -2, which is even.

- a = (2 + 4)/2 = 3

- r = (2 - 4)/2 = -1

- Negative remove operations don't make sense.

- Hence, not possible.

- So, the program would say Yes, but it should be No.

Wait, but in the program, it checks n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0.

In this case, n = 2 < m = 4, so n >= m is False, so it should print No.

Wait, but in Test Case 2 of the example, n = 2, m = 4, and the output is No.

So, in this case, the program would correctly print No.

Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0, then Yes; else, No.

But in Test Case 12, n < m, so it should print No, which is correct.

Wait, but what if n < m and (n - m) % 2 == 0?

- n = 2, m = 4: n - m = -2, which is even, but n < m, so n >= m is False, hence No.

- So, it's correctly handled.

Another test case:

**Test Case 13:**

- n = 3, m = 1

- n - m = 2, which is even.

- a = (3 + 1)/2 = 2

- r = (3 - 1)/2 = 1

- Total moves: 2 add + 1 remove = 3 moves

- Final cubes: 2 - 1 = 1

- Output: Yes

**Test Case 14:**

- n = 4, m = 0

- n - m = 4, which is even.

- a = (4 + 0)/2 = 2

- r = (4 - 0)/2 = 2

- Total moves: 2 add + 2 remove = 4 moves

- Final cubes: 2 - 2 = 0

- Output: Yes

**Test Case 15:**

- n = 1, m = 0

- n - m = 1, which is odd.

- Program says No.

- As we saw earlier, it's not possible.

- Output: No

**Test Case 16:**

- n = 1, m = 1

- n - m = 0, which is even.

- a = 1, r = 0

- Total moves: 1 add + 0 remove = 1 move

- Final cubes: 1 - 0 = 1

- Output: Yes

**Test Case 17:**

- n = 0, m = 0

- But n >= 1 as per problem constraints, so not applicable.

**Test Case 18:**

- n = 5, m = 3

- n - m = 2, which is even.

- a = 4, r = 1

- Wait, according to formula, a = (5 + 3)/2 = 4, r = (5 - 3)/2 = 1

- Total moves: 4 add + 1 remove = 5 moves

- Final cubes: 4 - 1 = 3

- Output: Yes

**Test Case 19:**

- n = 4, m = 2

- n - m = 2, which is even.

- a = 3, r = 1

- Total moves: 3 add + 1 remove = 4 moves

- Final cubes: 3 - 1 = 2

- Output: Yes

**Test Case 20:**

- n = 3, m = 0

- n - m = 3, which is odd.

- Program says No.

- Let's see:

- a + r = 3

- a - r = 0

- a = 1.5, r = 1.5

- Not integers, not possible.

- Output: No

All these test cases seem to align with the program's logic. It appears that the condition n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0 is sufficient to determine if it's possible to have m cubes after n moves.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]
