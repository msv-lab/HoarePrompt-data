Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The program is supposed to help Vasya create an array of n integers from a given list of m integers, such that the total difference D between Vasya's array and Petya's array is maximized. The total difference D is defined as the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two arrays.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. Petya has an array a of n integers, and Vasya has to create an array c of n integers from a given list of m integers b (where m >= n). The goal is to choose and arrange n integers from b to form c in such a way that the sum of absolute differences between a and c is as large as possible.

So, the program should take multiple test cases as input. Each test case starts with two integers n and m, followed by the array a of n integers, and then the array b of m integers. For each test case, the program should output a single integer, which is the maximum possible D.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to handle multiple test cases in a loop, as indicated by the input() calls inside the loop. The function func() is defined to encapsulate this logic.

Let's walk through the program step by step.

1. The function func() is defined, and it seems to handle all test cases.

2. It starts by reading the number of test cases, t, using int(input()).

3. For each test case:

a. Read n and m using map(int, input().split()).

b. Read array a of n integers.

c. Read array c of m integers (note: the variable name is c, which might be confusing since in the problem description, Vasya's array is c, and b is the list of m integers to choose from. In the code, it's using c for b, which could be a typo or confusion in variable names).

d. There's a condition: if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and a[0] == c[0], then print 0 and continue. This seems to handle the special case where all elements in a and c are the same, in which case the maximum D would indeed be 0, since any arrangement would result in zero difference.

e. Next, it sorts a and c in specific ways: a is sorted in ascending order, and c is sorted in descending order.

f. Then, it initializes variables i, j, and ans to 0.

g. It iterates k from 0 to len(a)-1:

i. Computes t1 as the absolute difference between a[i] and c[i].

ii. Computes t2 as the absolute difference between a[len(a)-j] and c[len(c)-j].

iii. If t2 > t1, increment j by 1.

iv. Else, increment i by 1.

v. Add the maximum of t1 and t2 to ans.

h. Finally, print ans.

Wait a minute, there are a few things here that need clarification.

First, the variable names: in the problem description, b is the list of m integers from which to choose n integers to form c. In the code, the list of m integers is read into variable c, which might be confusing, but I'll proceed with that.

Second, the sorting: a is sorted in ascending order, and c is sorted in descending order. This seems like a strategy to maximize the differences by pairing smallest a with largest c, and so on.

Third, the logic inside the loop where it computes t1 and t2 and decides whether to increment i or j based on which difference is larger. This part is a bit tricky to understand.

Let me think about a simpler approach to maximize D.

To maximize the sum of absolute differences, we need to choose c in such a way that each c[i] is as different as possible from a[i]. One intuitive way is to sort a and c in such a way that their elements are paired with maximum possible difference.

For example, sort a in ascending order and c in descending order, and then compute the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements. This should give the maximum possible D.

Wait, is that correct?

Let's consider an example:

Suppose a = [1, 2, 3], sorted ascending: [1, 2, 3]

Suppose c = [6, 5, 4], sorted descending: [6, 5, 4]

Then D = |1-6| + |2-5| + |3-4| = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9

Alternatively, if we sorted c in ascending order: [4, 5, 6]

Then D = |1-4| + |2-5| + |3-6| = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which is the same.

Wait, in this case, it's the same. But is this always the case?

Let's try another example:

a = [1, 2, 3], sorted ascending: [1, 2, 3]

c = [1, 2, 3], sorted descending: [3, 2, 1]

D = |1-3| + |2-2| + |3-1| = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4

Which is less than if we sorted c in ascending order: [1, 2, 3]

D = |1-1| + |2-2| + |3-3| = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

Wait, but according to the problem, we need to maximize D, so sorting a ascending and c descending seems better in this case.

But in the first example, both ways gave the same D.

Let me check the first example in the problem description.

Input:

9

4 6

6 1 2 4

3 5 1 7 2 3

...

Output:

16

According to the explanation, one possible c is [1,5,7,2], and D = |6-1| + |1-5| + |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 16.

Is there a way to get a larger D?

Let's sort a: [1,2,4,6]

Sort c in descending order: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Choose the top 4: [7,5,3,3]

Then D = |1-7| + |2-5| + |4-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 13, which is less than 16.

Wait, so in this case, sorting a ascending and c descending gives D=13, which is less than the D=16 achieved by choosing [1,5,7,2].

Hmm, so the initial approach of sorting a ascending and c descending doesn't always give the maximum D.

Therefore, the program's logic seems more involved.

Looking back at the code:

After sorting a ascending and c descending, it initializes i and j to 0 and 1 respectively, and iterates through a loop where it computes t1 and t2, and based on their values, increments i or j, and adds the maximum of t1 and t2 to ans.

This seems like a greedy approach to select elements from c to pair with elements from a, in a way that maximizes the total difference.

But it's not clear to me why this specific logic would always work.

Let me think of another approach.

An alternative way to maximize D is to assign the largest possible c[j] to the smallest a[i], and the smallest c[j] to the largest a[i], ensuring that each c[j] is used only once.

Wait, but c can have duplicates, so we need to be careful.

Actually, since we can choose any n elements from m, and arrange them in any order, the problem reduces to selecting n elements from b and arranging them in such a way that the sum of absolute differences with a is maximized.

This sounds like we need to pair the smallest a with the largest possible c, the second smallest a with the second largest possible c, and so on.

Wait, but actually, to maximize the difference, we should pair the smallest a with the largest c, and the largest a with the smallest c.

Wait, no. To maximize the difference, for each a[i], we should choose c[j] that maximizes |a[i] - c[j]|.

But since we can arrange c in any order, we can independently choose c[j] for each a[i] to maximize |a[i] - c[j]|.

Wait, but there's a constraint that c must be a permutation of n elements chosen from b.

Actually, since we can arrange c in any order, the pairing between a and c is arbitrary, meaning we can pair a[i] with any c[j], and arrange c[j] in any order.

Therefore, to maximize the sum of |a[i] - c[j]|, we should pair each a[i] with the c[j] that maximizes |a[i] - c[j]|, considering the constraints of choosing n distinct elements from b.

Wait, but since c can be arranged in any order, it's equivalent to assigning each a[i] to the c[j] that maximizes |a[i] - c[j]|, with the constraint that each c[j] is used only once.

This sounds like an assignment problem, where we need to assign each a[i] to a unique c[j] to maximize the sum of |a[i] - c[j]|.

In assignment problems, the Hungarian algorithm can be used, but it's too slow for the given constraints (n up to 2e5 per test case).

Is there a smarter way?

Let me consider sorting a and c in opposite orders.

Suppose we sort a in ascending order and c in descending order.

Then, pairing a[i] with c[i] would give us the maximum possible |a[i] - c[i]| for each i, assuming that c is sorted in descending order.

Wait, but in the first example, this approach didn't give the maximum D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating it.

Let me recalculate.

First test case:

a = [6,1,2,4], sorted a = [1,2,4,6]

c = [3,5,1,7,2,3], sorted c descending = [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Choose the top 4 from c: [7,5,3,3]

Pair them with a: [1,2,4,6] with [7,5,3,3]

D = |1-7| + |2-5| + |4-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 13, which is less than the D=16 achieved by pairing [1,5,7,2] as in the explanation.

So, there must be a better way than just pairing sorted a with sorted c in opposite orders.

Wait, perhaps we need to select a subset of c that allows us to pair a[i] with c[j] in a way that maximizes the sum of |a[i] - c[j]|.

This seems complicated.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to be attempting a greedy approach where it tries to choose for each a[i], the c[j] that maximizes |a[i] - c[j]|, considering the remaining elements in c.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me look at the code again.

After sorting a ascending and c descending, it initializes i and j to 0 and 1 respectively, and iterates through a loop where it computes t1 and t2, and based on their values, increments i or j, and adds the maximum of t1 and t2 to ans.

This seems unclear to me.

Maybe I should consider a different approach.

Let me consider that to maximize the sum of |a[i] - c[j]|, I need to select c[j] for each a[i] such that |a[i] - c[j]| is maximized, given the constraints.

But since c is a permutation of n elements chosen from b, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as follows:

- To maximize the sum of |a[i] - c[i]|, I need to select c[i] for each a[i] such that |a[i] - c[i]| is as large as possible, with the constraint that all c[i] are distinct and come from b.

This sounds like assigning to each a[i] the c[j] that is farthest from a[i], but with the constraint that each c[j] is used only once.

This is similar to assigning tasks to workers with maximum cost, which is again an assignment problem.

But solving it directly would be too slow for n up to 2e5.

Is there a smarter way?

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort b in ascending order.

- Then, for each a[i], we can choose either the smallest possible c[j] or the largest possible c[j] that hasn't been used yet, whichever gives the maximum |a[i] - c[j]|.

- To maximize the sum, we can pair the smallest a[i] with the largest unused c[j], and the largest a[i] with the smallest unused c[j].

Wait, that might work.

Let me try with the first example.

a = [1,2,4,6], sorted.

b = [1,2,3,3,5,7], sorted.

We can choose c as [1,2,3,7].

Then pair:

- a[0]=1 with c[3]=7: |1-7|=6

- a[1]=2 with c[0]=1: |2-1|=1

- a[2]=4 with c[1]=2: |4-2|=2

- a[3]=6 with c[2]=3: |6-3|=3

Total D=6+1+2+3=12, which matches the third example in the problem description.

But in the first example, the output is 16, which is higher than 12.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose different elements.

Wait, in the first example, they chose c=[1,5,7,2], which gives D=16.

But according to this approach, choosing c=[1,2,3,7] gives D=12, which is less.

So, perhaps this approach isn't optimal.

Wait, maybe I need to choose c in a different way.

Let me try choosing c=[7,5,3,3].

Pair a=[1,2,4,6] with c=[7,5,3,3]:

D=|1-7| + |2-5| + |4-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 13, which is still less than 16.

So, perhaps there's a better way to choose c.

Wait, in the explanation, they chose c=[1,5,7,2], which is not sorted in any particular order.

So, perhaps just sorting a and c in opposite orders doesn't always give the maximum D.

Maybe I need to consider a different strategy.

Let me consider that for each a[i], I should choose the c[j] that is as far as possible from a[i], either the smallest or the largest in b.

But since I have to choose n elements, I need to select a combination that maximizes the sum.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps another way is to consider that the maximum possible D is achieved when for each a[i], c[i] is either the smallest or the largest element in b that hasn't been used yet.

So, for each a[i], choose c[i] to be the element from b that maximizes |a[i] - c[i]|, ensuring that each c[i] is unique.

This sounds similar to a greedy algorithm where for each a[i], we choose the c[j] that maximizes |a[i] - c[j]|, and mark it as used.

But implementing this directly would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 2e5.

Is there a way to optimize this?

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort a and b.

Then, for each a[i], I can binary search in b to find the element that is farthest from a[i], and select that.

But since I have to choose n distinct elements, I need to make sure that once I select a c[j], it's not selected again.

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can use two pointers, one pointing to the smallest unused element in b and one to the largest unused element in b.

Then, for each a[i], I choose between the smallest and largest remaining elements in b, whichever gives the larger |a[i] - c[j]|.

This sounds promising.

Let me try with the first example.

a = [1,2,4,6], sorted.

b = [1,2,3,3,5,7], sorted.

Initialize two pointers: left=0, right=5.

For a[0]=1:

- Choose between b[left]=1 and b[right]=7.

- |1-1|=0, |1-7|=6.

- Choose b[right]=7, D +=6.

- Mark b[right]=7 as used, move right-=1.

For a[1]=2:

- Choose between b[left]=1 and b[right]=5.

- |2-1|=1, |2-5|=3.

- Choose b[right]=5, D +=3.

- Mark b[right]=5 as used, move right-=1.

For a[2]=4:

- Choose between b[left]=1 and b[right]=3.

- |4-1|=3, |4-3|=1.

- Choose b[left]=1, D +=3.

- Mark b[left]=1 as used, move left+=1.

For a[3]=6:

- Choose between b[left]=2 and b[right]=3.

- |6-2|=4, |6-3|=3.

- Choose b[left]=2, D +=4.

- Mark b[left]=2 as used.

Total D=6+3+3+4=16, which matches the first example.

Great, this seems to work.

So, the algorithm is:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort b in ascending order.

- Initialize two pointers, left=0 and right=m-1.

- For each a[i] in sorted a:

- Compute |a[i] - b[left]| and |a[i] - b[right]|.

- Choose the one that gives the larger difference, add it to D.

- Mark that b[j] as used by moving the pointer (left+=1 or right-=1).

This ensures that for each a[i], we choose the c[j] that maximizes |a[i] - c[j]| from the available elements in b.

This approach is O(n log n) for sorting a, O(m log m) for sorting b, and O(n) for the selection, which is acceptable given the constraints.

Now, looking back at the provided program, it seems to be attempting something similar, but I need to verify if it correctly implements this logic.

In the program:

- It sorts a ascending: a.sort()

- It sorts c descending: c.sort(reverse=True)

- Then, it initializes i=0, j=1, ans=0

- For each k in range(n):

- t1 = |a[i] - c[i]|

- t2 = |a[len(a)-j] - c[len(c)-j]|

- If t2 > t1, increment j by 1

- Else, increment i by 1

- Add max(t1, t2) to ans

This seems different from the approach I just described.

In my approach, for each a[i], I choose between the current smallest and largest available in b, and pick the one that gives the larger difference.

In the provided program, it seems to be comparing t1 and t2, where t1 is the difference between a[i] and c[i], and t2 is the difference between a[len(a)-j] and c[len(c)-j].

Then, based on which is larger, it increments i or j.

This seems unclear to me.

Let me try to apply this logic to the first example.

First example:

a = [6,1,2,4], sorted a = [1,2,4,6]

c = [3,5,1,7,2,3], sorted descending c = [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Initialize i=0, j=1, ans=0

For k=0:

t1 = |a[0] - c[0]| = |1-7| = 6

t2 = |a[4-1=3] - c[6-1=5]| = |6-1|=5

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 1

ans += 6

For k=1:

t1 = |a[1] - c[1]| = |2-5|=3

t2 = |a[4-2=2] - c[6-2=4]| = |4-2|=2

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 2

ans += 3 (total ans=9)

For k=2:

t1 = |a[2] - c[2]| = |4-3|=1

t2 = |a[4-3=1] - c[6-3=3]| = |2-3|=1

Since t2 == t1, presumably increment i to 3

ans +=1 (total ans=10)

For k=3:

t1 = |a[3] - c[3]| = |6-3|=3

t2 = |a[4-4=0] - c[6-4=2]| = |1-3|=2

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 4

ans +=3 (total ans=13)

But according to the explanation, D should be 16.

So, the program seems to be giving D=13, which is less than the possible 16.

Therefore, the program seems to be incorrect.

Wait, but in the explanation, they achieved D=16 by choosing c=[1,5,7,2].

Let me see what the program chooses.

From the steps above:

k=0: choose c[0]=7, paired with a[0]=1, D+=6, i=1

k=1: choose c[1]=5, paired with a[1]=2, D+=3, i=2

k=2: choose c[2]=3, paired with a[2]=4, D+=1, i=3

k=3: choose c[3]=3, paired with a[3]=6, D+=3, i=4

So, c chosen is [7,5,3,3], which gives D=13.

But in the explanation, they chose c=[1,5,7,2], which gives D=16.

So, the program's approach is missing this higher D.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the output, it's printing 16 for the first test case.

Wait, perhaps the program is doing something else.

Wait, in the code, it's printing ans, which in my calculation was 13, but according to the sample output, it's 16.

So, maybe my calculation is wrong.

Let me check again.

Wait, in the first iteration:

t1 = |1-7|=6

t2 = |6-1|=5

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 1

ans +=6

Second iteration:

t1 = |2-5|=3

t2 = |4-2|=2

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 2

ans +=3 (total 9)

Third iteration:

t1 = |4-3|=1

t2 = |2-3|=1

Since t2 == t1, maybe increment i to 3

ans +=1 (total 10)

Fourth iteration:

t1 = |6-3|=3

t2 = |1-3|=2

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 4

ans +=3 (total 13)

But according to the sample output, it's 16.

So, either my calculation is wrong or the program is doing something different.

Wait, perhaps the program is not choosing c in the way I thought.

Wait, maybe the program is incorrect, or maybe I'm misunderstanding it.

Let me look at another test case.

Second test case:

3 4

1 1 1

1 1 1 1

According to the program, since len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and a[0]==c[0], it prints 0, which is correct.

Third test case:

5 5

1 2 3 4 5

1 2 3 4 5

Sorted a: [1,2,3,4,5]

Sorted c descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

Choose c=[5,4,3,2,1]

D=|1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| + |4-2| + |5-1| =4+2+0+2+4=12, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, it works.

Another test case:

2 6

5 8

8 7 5 8 2 10

Sorted a: [5,8]

Sorted c descending: [10,8,8,7,5,2]

Choose c=[10,2]

D=|5-10| + |8-2| =5 +6=11, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

4 6

8 10 6 4

3 10 6 1 8 9

Sorted a: [4,6,8,10]

Sorted c descending: [10,9,8,6,3,1]

Choose c=[10,9,8,1]

D=|4-10| + |6-9| + |8-8| + |10-1|=6+3+0+9=18, but the sample output is 25, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps my approach is still not optimal.

Wait, in this test case, the sample output is 25, but my approach gives 18, which is less.

So, the program must be doing something else to achieve a higher D.

Therefore, my earlier approach is insufficient, and there must be a better way to select c to maximize D.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps, instead of pairing the smallest a with the largest c and so on, I need to consider all possible pairings and select the one that gives the maximum sum of differences.

But that's too computationally expensive.

Is there a way to maximize the sum of |a[i] - c[j]| by selecting a subset of c and permuting it appropriately?

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the maximum sum of |a[i] - c[j]| is equal to the sum of the maximum |a[i] - c[j]| for each a[i], with c[j] chosen optimally.

But again, this seems similar to the earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of matching each a[i] to the c[j] that is farthest from it, but in a way that avoids conflicts.

This sounds like a maximum weight matching problem, where the weights are the absolute differences.

But again, for large n, this is not feasible.

Is there a property of the absolute difference that I can exploit here?

Wait, perhaps I can consider splitting a into two parts: one to be matched with the smallest elements of c, and the other with the largest elements of c.

For example, for elements of a that are smaller than elements in c, match them with the largest possible c, and for elements of a that are larger than elements in c, match them with the smallest possible c.

Let me try this with the first example.

a = [1,2,4,6]

c = [1,2,3,3,5,7]

For a[i]=1: closest to c=1, but to maximize difference, choose c=7.

For a[i]=2: choose c=7 or c=1. |2-7|=5, |2-1|=1. Choose c=7.

But c=7 is already chosen for a=1, so choose c=5: |2-5|=3.

For a[i]=4: choose c=1: |4-1|=3.

For a[i]=6: choose c=1: |6-1|=5.

Total D=5+3+3+5=16, which matches the sample.

But in my earlier approach using two pointers, I got D=13.

So, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.

Let me consider that for each a[i], I should choose the c[j] that maximizes |a[i] - c[j]|, considering the previously chosen c[j].

This seems like a greedy approach, but it might not always be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can sort a and c, and then decide for each a[i] whether to pair with the current smallest or largest c[j], based on which gives a larger difference.

Wait, maybe I can use a two-pointer approach where I have one pointer at the start of c (smallest) and one at the end (largest), and for each a[i], I choose the one that gives the larger difference.

Let me try this with the first example.

a = [1,2,4,6]

c = [1,2,3,3,5,7]

Initialize left=0, right=5

For a[0]=1:

Choose between c[left]=1 and c[right]=7

|1-1|=0, |1-7|=6 → choose c[right]=7, D+=6

Move right to 4

For a[1]=2:

Choose between c[left]=1 and c[right]=5

|2-1|=1, |2-5|=3 → choose c[right]=5, D+=3

Move right to 3

For a[2]=4:

Choose between c[left]=1 and c[right]=3

|4-1|=3, |4-3|=1 → choose c[left]=1, D+=3

Move left to 1

For a[3]=6:

Choose between c[left]=2 and c[right]=3

|6-2|=4, |6-3|=3 → choose c[left]=2, D+=4

Total D=6+3+3+4=16, which matches the sample.

Great, this seems to work.

So, the algorithm is:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort c in ascending order.

- Initialize two pointers: left=0 and right=m-1.

- For each a[i] in sorted a:

- Compute diff1 = |a[i] - c[left]|

- Compute diff2 = |a[i] - c[right]|

- If diff1 > diff2:

- Choose c[left], add diff1 to D, move left +=1

- Else:

- Choose c[right], add diff2 to D, move right -=1

This ensures that for each a[i], we choose the c[j] that gives the maximum possible difference, considering the remaining elements in c.

This approach is efficient, with a time complexity of O(m log m) for sorting c, and O(n log n) for sorting a, which is acceptable for n and m up to 2e5.

Now, looking back at the provided program, it seems to be attempting something similar but with some differences.

In the program:

- It sorts a in ascending order: a.sort()

- It sorts c in descending order: c.sort(reverse=True)

- It initializes i=0, j=1, ans=0

- For each k in range(n):

- t1 = |a[i] - c[i]|

- t2 = |a[len(a)-j] - c[len(c)-j]|

- If t2 > t1:

- j +=1

- Else:

- i +=1

- ans += max(t1, t2)

This seems different from the two-pointer approach I just described.

In my approach, for each a[i], I choose between c[left] and c[right], pick the one with the larger difference, add it to D, and move the corresponding pointer.

In the provided program, it seems to be comparing t1 and t2, where t1 is |a[i] - c[i]| and t2 is |a[n-j] - c[m-j]|, and based on which is larger, it increments i or j.

This seems unclear to me, and in my earlier example, it gave D=13 instead of 16.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the indices.

Let me try again with the first example.

a = [1,2,4,6]

c = [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Initialize i=0, j=1, ans=0

For k=0:

t1 = |a[0] - c[0]| = |1-7|=6

t2 = |a[4-1=3] - c[6-1=5]| = |6-1|=5

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 1

ans +=6

For k=1:

t1 = |a[1] - c[1]| = |2-5|=3

t2 = |a[4-2=2] - c[6-2=4]| = |4-2|=2

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 2

ans +=3 (total=9)

For k=2:

t1 = |a[2] - c[2]| = |4-3|=1

t2 = |a[4-3=1] - c[6-3=3]| = |2-3|=1

Since t2 == t1, perhaps increment j to 2

ans +=1 (total=10)

For k=3:

t1 = |a[3] - c[3]| = |6-3|=3

t2 = |a[4-4=0] - c[6-4=2]| = |1-3|=2

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 3

ans +=3 (total=13)

But according to the sample, D=16.

So, it seems like the program is not correctly implementing the logic to achieve the maximum D.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding of the code.

Let me look at the code again:

for k in range(len(a)):

t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])

t2 = abs(a[len(a)-j] - c[len(c)-j])

if t2 > t1:

j +=1

else:

i +=1

ans += max(t1, t2)

In the first iteration:

k=0, i=0, j=1

t1 = |a[0]-c[0]| = |1-7|=6

t2 = |a[4-1=3]-c[6-1=5]| = |6-1|=5

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 1

ans +=6

Second iteration:

k=1, i=1, j=1

t1 = |a[1]-c[1]| = |2-5|=3

t2 = |a[4-1=3]-c[6-1=5]| = |6-1|=5

Since t2 > t1, increment j to 2

ans +=5 (total=11)

Third iteration:

k=2, i=1, j=2

t1 = |a[1]-c[1]| = |2-5|=3

t2 = |a[4-2=2]-c[6-2=4]| = |4-2|=2

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 2

ans +=3 (total=14)

Fourth iteration:

k=3, i=2, j=2

t1 = |a[2]-c[2]| = |4-3|=1

t2 = |a[4-2=2]-c[6-2=4]| = |4-2|=2

Since t2 > t1, increment j to 3

ans +=2 (total=16)

So, in this case, ans=16, which matches the sample output.

Wait, earlier I had ans=13, but now it's 16. I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation.

So, perhaps the program is correct after all.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had ans=13, but according to this, it's 16.

Let me check where I went wrong.

First iteration:

k=0, i=0, j=1

t1=6, t2=5

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 1

ans +=6 (ans=6)

Second iteration:

k=1, i=1, j=1

t1=|2-5|=3, t2=|6-1|=5

Since t2 > t1, increment j to 2

ans +=5 (ans=11)

Third iteration:

k=2, i=1, j=2

t1=|2-5|=3, t2=|4-2|=2

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 2

ans +=3 (ans=14)

Fourth iteration:

k=3, i=2, j=2

t1=|4-3|=1, t2=|2-3|=1

Since t2 == t1, perhaps increment j to 3

ans +=1 (ans=15)

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, it's 16.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the indices.

Wait, in the fourth iteration, k=3, i=2, j=2

t1=|4-3|=1

t2=|a[4-2=2]-c[6-2=4]| = |4-2|=2

Since t2 > t1, increment j to 3

ans +=2 (ans=16)

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in this case, ans=16, which matches the sample output.

Earlier, I must have miscounted the indices.

Therefore, the program seems to be working correctly for this test case.

Let me check another test case.

Test case:

n=2, m=6

a=[5,8]

c=[8,7,5,8,2,10]

Sort a: [5,8]

Sort c descending: [10,8,8,7,5,2]

Initialize i=0, j=1, ans=0

First iteration:

k=0, i=0, j=1

t1=|5-10|=5

t2=|8-2|=6

Since t2 > t1, increment j to 2

ans +=6 (ans=6)

Second iteration:

k=1, i=0, j=2

t1=|5-10|=5

t2=|8-5|=3

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 1

ans +=5 (ans=11)

Total D=11, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=4, m=6

a=[8,10,6,4]

c=[3,10,6,1,8,9]

Sort a: [4,6,8,10]

Sort c descending: [10,9,8,6,3,1]

Initialize i=0, j=1, ans=0

First iteration:

k=0, i=0, j=1

t1=|4-10|=6

t2=|10-1|=9

Since t2 > t1, increment j to 2

ans +=9 (ans=9)

Second iteration:

k=1, i=0, j=2

t1=|4-10|=6

t2=|8-3|=5

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 1

ans +=6 (ans=15)

Third iteration:

k=2, i=1, j=2

t1=|6-9|=3

t2=|8-3|=5

Since t2 > t1, increment j to 3

ans +=5 (ans=20)

Fourth iteration:

k=3, i=1, j=3

t1=|6-9|=3

t2=|6-1|=5

Since t2 > t1, increment j to 4

ans +=5 (ans=25)

Total D=25, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, it works correctly.

Another test case:

n=3, m=5

a=[6,5,2]

c=[1,7,9,7,2]

Sort a: [2,5,6]

Sort c descending: [9,7,7,2,1]

Initialize i=0, j=1, ans=0

First iteration:

k=0, i=0, j=1

t1=|2-9|=7

t2=|6-1|=5

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 1

ans +=7 (ans=7)

Second iteration:

k=1, i=1, j=1

t1=|5-7|=2

t2=|6-1|=5

Since t2 > t1, increment j to 2

ans +=5 (ans=12)

Third iteration:

k=2, i=1, j=2

t1=|5-7|=2

t2=|5-2|=3

Since t2 > t1, increment j to 3

ans +=3 (ans=15)

Total D=15, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=5
