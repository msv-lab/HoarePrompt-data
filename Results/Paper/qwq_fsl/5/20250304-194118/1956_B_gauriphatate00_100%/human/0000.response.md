Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The goal is to determine whether the program meets the requirements as specified in the description. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that partial correctness isn't accepted; the program must handle every potential case correctly to be considered true.

I've been provided with some examples to understand how this works. In Example 1, the problem is to identify non-prime numbers, and the provided program seems to correctly implement this, so the correctness is True. In Example 2, the task is to count substrings that start and end with the same character, but the program provided might have flaws, leading to Correctness False. Similarly, in Example 3, the binary search function might not be implemented correctly, resulting in Correctness False.

Now, for my task, the problem description is quite involved. It's a card game between me and Nene, where we have a deck of 2n cards, each card has an integer from 1 to n, and each integer appears exactly twice. The deck is divided equally between me and Nene, so each gets n cards.

The game proceeds with 2n turns, alternating between me and Nene, starting with me. In each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, and if there's already a card with the same number on the table, they get a point. Then, the selected card is placed on the table.

Nene is smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

Given my hand of cards, I need to determine the maximum number of points I can get by playing optimally.

Input:

- The first line contains t (number of test cases).

- For each test case:

- The first line is n (number of cards each player has).

- The second line is a list of n integers representing the cards in my hand.

Constraints:

- 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5

- Each integer in my hand is between 1 and n, and each integer appears at most twice.

Total sum of n across all test cases ≤ 2*10^5.

Output:

For each test case, output a single integer representing the maximum points I can get.

Example:

Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

Output:

1

2

1

0

0

In the first test case, explanation is provided detailing the game flow and how I end up with 1 point.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```

t = int(input())

results = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

result = func_1(a, n)

results.append(result)

for res in results:

print(res)

def func_1(a, n):

count_a = {}

for num in a:

if num in count_a:

count_a[num] += 1

else:

count_a[num] = 1

max_score = 0

for num in range(1, n + 1):

if num in count_a:

if count_a[num] == 2:

max_score += 1

return max_score

```

So, the program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the list of cards in my hand. It calls func_1 to compute the result and stores it, then prints all results at the end.

func_1 counts the frequency of each number in my hand and then checks how many numbers appear exactly twice in my hand. It sums these up to get max_score, which is returned.

Wait a minute, is this logic correct?

Let me think about the problem again.

The goal is to maximize my score, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, I need to consider the sequence in which we play our cards, keeping in mind that Nene is smart and will play to her advantage.

In the game, cards are played in turns, alternating between me and Nene, and the scoring depends on whether a card's number is already on the table.

I need to think about how the order of playing cards affects the scoring.

Let's consider that for a number that appears twice in my hand, if I play both, I can get a point from the second one, provided that Nene hasn't played her card with that number in between.

Similarly, for numbers where I have only one card, I might need to consider when Nene plays her card with the same number.

It seems more complicated than just counting how many numbers appear twice in my hand.

Wait, in the provided program, it's simply counting how many numbers appear twice in my hand and using that as the score. Is that sufficient?

Let me look at the first test case:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

According to the program, in my hand, 1 appears twice, and others appear once. So, max_score=1.

Which matches the sample output and the explanation.

In the second test case:

n=8

My cards:7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Nene's cards would have the remaining cards:3,6,3,6,4,1,2,7

Wait, hold on, each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice. So, for n=8, numbers 1 to 8 each appear twice in the entire deck.

So, Nene's cards would be the other instances of the numbers not in my hand.

In my hand:7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, Nene has:3,6,3,6,4,1,2,7

Wait, but 4 appears twice in my hand (one 4), so Nene has one 4.

Wait, no, wait, in my hand, 4 appears once, 1 appears once, 2 appears once, 7 appears once, 8 appears twice, 5 appears twice.

So, Nene has the other instances:

For 1, she has one 1; for 2, one 2; for 4, one 4; for 5, one 5; for 7, one 7; for 8, one 8; and for 3 and 6, which appear twice in her hand.

Wait, in my hand:7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, my hand: 7(1),4(1),1(1),2(1),8(2),5(2)

Nene's hand:7(1),4(1),1(1),2(1),8(1),5(1),3(2),6(2)

Wait, but in the problem, it's guaranteed that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire deck.

So, in my hand, for each number, it can appear up to twice, but since there are only n cards per player, and 2n cards in total, with each number appearing exactly twice.

So, in my hand, for each number, it can appear 0,1, or 2 times, but in total, across both hands, each number appears exactly twice.

In this test case, according to the program, in my hand, 8 appears twice, 5 appears twice, and others appear once. So, max_score=2, which matches the sample output.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let me think of another test case.

Test case:

n=3

My hand:1,2,3

Nene's hand:1,2,3

According to the program, in my hand, all numbers appear once, so max_score=0, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=1

My hand:1

Nene's hand:1

According to the program, in my hand, 1 appears once, so max_score=0, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but let's think about another scenario.

Suppose n=2

My hand:1,1

Nene's hand:2,2

According to the program, in my hand, 1 appears twice, so max_score=1.

Is that correct?

Let's simulate the game:

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point (since table is empty)

- Turn 2: Nene plays 2, no point

- Turn 3: I play 1, now there is already a 1 on the table, so I get 1 point

- Turn 4: Nene plays 2, now there is already a 2 on the table, so she gets 1 point

So, I get 1 point, which matches the program's output.

Another scenario:

n=2

My hand:1,2

Nene's hand:1,2

According to the program, in my hand, both numbers appear once, so max_score=0.

Simulate the game:

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 1, gets 1 point

- Turn 3: I play 2, no point

- Turn 4: Nene plays 2, gets 1 point

So, I get 0 points, which matches the program's logic.

Another test case:

n=5

My hand:1,1,2,3,4

Nene's hand:2,3,4,5,5

According to the program, in my hand, 1 appears twice, others appear once, so max_score=1.

Simulate the game:

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 5, no point

- Turn 3: I play 1, get 1 point (since 1 is already on the table)

- Turn 4: Nene plays 2, no point

- Turn 5: I play 2, get 1 point (since 2 is already on the table)

- Turn 6: Nene plays 3, no point

- Turn 7: I play 3, get 1 point

- Turn 8: Nene plays 4, no point

- Turn 9: I play 4, get 1 point

- Turn 10: Nene plays 5, get 1 point

Wait, according to this simulation, I get 3 points, but according to the program, it would return 1, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about Nene's optimal play.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, in this scenario, Nene would play to prevent me from getting points.

In turn 2, Nene could play 2 instead of 5, to prevent me from getting a point when I play 2.

Let's try:

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 2, no point

- Turn 3: I play 1, get 1 point

- Turn 4: Nene plays 3, no point

- Turn 5: I play 2, get 1 point (since 2 is already on the table)

- Turn 6: Nene plays 4, no point

- Turn 7: I play 3, get 1 point

- Turn 8: Nene plays 5, no point

- Turn 9: I play 4, get 1 point

- Turn 10: Nene plays 5, get 1 point

Wait, I still get 3 points, which contradicts the program's logic of returning 1.

Wait, maybe Nene can play differently to minimize my points.

Alternative play:

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 2, no point

- Turn 3: I play 1, get 1 point

- Turn 4: Nene plays 3, no point

- Turn 5: I play 4, no point

- Turn 6: Nene plays 5, no point

- Turn 7: I play 2, get 1 point

- Turn 8: Nene plays 3, get 1 point

- Turn 9: I play 3, get 1 point

- Turn 10: Nene plays 4, get 1 point

Wait, I still get 3 points.

Another try:

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 2, no point

- Turn 3: I play 1, get 1 point

- Turn 4: Nene plays 4, no point

- Turn 5: I play 2, get 1 point

- Turn 6: Nene plays 3, no point

- Turn 7: I play 3, get 1 point

- Turn 8: Nene plays 5, no point

- Turn 9: I play 4, get 1 point

- Turn 10: Nene plays 5, get 1 point

Again, I get 3 points.

Wait, maybe Nene can interleave her plays to minimize my points.

Wait, perhaps in some plays, I can get fewer points.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something about Nene's optimal strategy.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the program's logic is correct, and in the example I just thought about, I can't get more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in simulating.

Let me try again.

Suppose n=5

My hand:1,1,2,3,4

Nene's hand:2,3,4,5,5

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, in her turns, she will try to play cards that either allow her to score points or prevent me from scoring points.

Let's see:

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 5, no point

- Turn 3: I play 1, get 1 point

- Turn 4: Nene plays 2, no point

- Turn 5: I play 2, get 1 point

- Turn 6: Nene plays 3, no point

- Turn 7: I play 3, get 1 point

- Turn 8: Nene plays 4, no point

- Turn 9: I play 4, get 1 point

- Turn 10: Nene plays 5, get 1 point

So, I get 3 points.

Is there a way for Nene to play so that I get only 1 point?

Let's try:

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 2, no point

- Turn 3: I play 1, get 1 point

- Turn 4: Nene plays 3, no point

- Turn 5: I play 2, get 1 point

- Turn 6: Nene plays 4, no point

- Turn 7: I play 3, get 1 point

- Turn 8: Nene plays 5, no point

- Turn 9: I play 4, get 1 point

- Turn 10: Nene plays 5, get 1 point

Again, I get 3 points.

Another attempt:

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 2, no point

- Turn 3: I play 1, get 1 point

- Turn 4: Nene plays 4, no point

- Turn 5: I play 2, get 1 point

- Turn 6: Nene plays 5, no point

- Turn 7: I play 3, get 0 points (since 3 is not on the table yet)

- Turn 8: Nene plays 3, get 1 point

- Turn 9: I play 4, get 1 point

- Turn 10: Nene plays 5, get 1 point

In this case, I get 2 points.

Still more than the program's output of 1.

Wait, maybe Nene can force me to get only 1 point.

Let me try:

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 2, no point

- Turn 3: I play 1, get 1 point

- Turn 4: Nene plays 3, no point

- Turn 5: I play 4, no point

- Turn 6: Nene plays 5, no point

- Turn 7: I play 2, get 1 point

- Turn 8: Nene plays 3, get 1 point

- Turn 9: I play 3, get 1 point

- Turn 10: Nene plays 4, get 1 point

Again, I get 2 points.

Wait, perhaps in some sequences, I can only get 1 point.

Wait, maybe if Nene plays in a way to maximize her points and minimize mine, but I'm not seeing it right now.

Alternatively, maybe the program's logic is correct, and in reality, I can only get 1 point in this scenario.

But in the simulations above, it seems like I can get more.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the program's logic is that for each number I have two cards of, I can get one point, assuming Nene plays optimally to prevent me from getting more.

In the first test case, n=4, I have two 1's, so I get 1 point.

In the second test case, n=8, I have two 8's and two 5's, so I get 2 points.

In the third test case, n=8, I have one of each except two 4's, but in the simulation, I might get more, but perhaps not.

Wait, in the third test case:

n=8

My hand:7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, I have two 4's, others appear once.

According to the program, max_score=1.

Is that correct?

Let's simulate:

Nene's hand:3,6,3,6,4,1,2,7

Wait, no, in my hand:7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, my hand:7(1),1(1),4(2),5(1),3(1),2(1),6(1)

Nene's hand:7(1),1(1),4(1),5(1),3(2),2(1),6(1)

Wait, but each number should appear exactly twice in total.

So, my hand:7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

Nene's hand:7,1,4,5,3,2,6,8

Wait, n=8, so numbers from 1 to 8.

Wait, but in my hand, I have 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6, which are numbers 1 to 7, and 4 appears twice.

So, Nene has the other instances:7,1,4,5,3,2,6,8

Wait, but 8 is not in my hand, so Nene has one 8.

Wait, n=8, so numbers 1 to 8, each appearing twice.

In my hand, I have:

7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, Nene has:

7,1,4,5,3,2,6,8

Wait, but 4 appears twice in my hand, so Nene has only one 4.

Wait, no, in my hand, 4 appears twice, so Nene has only one 4.

Wait, but in total, there are two 4's.

Similarly, in my hand, 7 appears once, so Nene has one 7, and so on.

So, Nene's hand:7,1,4,5,3,2,6,8

Now, according to the program, in my hand, only 4 appears twice, so max_score=1.

Let's simulate the game:

- Turn 1: I play 4, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 7, no point

- Turn 3: I play 4, get 1 point (since 4 is already on the table)

- Turn 4: Nene plays 1, no point

- Turn 5: I play 1, get 1 point (since 1 is already on the table)

- Turn 6: Nene plays 5, no point

- Turn 7: I play 5, get 1 point

- Turn 8: Nene plays 3, no point

- Turn 9: I play 3, get 1 point

- Turn 0: Nene plays 2, no point

- Turn 11: I play 2, get 1 point

- Turn 12: Nene plays 6, no point

- Turn 13: I play 6, get 1 point

- Turn 14: Nene plays 8, no point

Wait, but n=8, so 16 turns, but this is getting too long.

In this simulation, I get multiple points, but according to the program, it's 1.

This suggests that the program's logic might be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe in optimal play, Nene can prevent me from getting more than one point.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the logic is that for each pair I have, I can guarantee one point, and for single cards, I can't get any points.

So, in the first test case, I have one pair (two 1's), so I get one point.

In the second test case, I have two pairs (two 8's and two 5's), so I get two points.

In the third test case, I have one pair (two 4's), so I get one point.

In the fourth test case, n=3, my hand:1,2,3, no pairs, so I get zero points.

In the fifth test case, n=1, my hand:1, no pair, so I get zero points.

This seems consistent with the sample output.

But in my earlier simulation, it seems like I can get more points, but maybe that's because Nene isn't playing optimally.

Wait, perhaps Nene can play in a way that minimizes my points beyond just considering my pairs.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I have a pair, and Nene has single cards.

If I play the pair cards one after the other, I get one point.

But if I have multiple pairs, I can get points for each pair.

But in reality, Nene can interleave her plays to prevent me from getting points from my pairs.

Wait, but in the earlier test case where n=5, my hand:1,1,2,3,4, according to the program, I should get one point, but in simulation, I get more.

Perhaps the program's logic is incomplete or incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the program's logic is correct, and I'm misunderstanding Nene's optimal play.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose that for each pair I have, I can guarantee one point, and for single cards, I can't guarantee any points because Nene can play her cards in a way to prevent me from getting points from singles.

In the first test case, I have one pair (two 1's), so I get one point.

In the second test case, I have two pairs (two 8's and two 5's), so I get two points.

In the third test case, I have one pair (two 4's), so I get one point.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, no pairs, so zero points.

Is this always true?

Let me think of a case where I have one pair, but I can get more than one point.

Suppose n=3

My hand:1,1,2

Nene's hand:2,3,3

According to the program, I have one pair, so max_score=1.

But let's simulate:

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 2, no point

- Turn 3: I play 1, get 1 point

- Turn 4: Nene plays 3, no point

- Turn 5: I play 2, get 1 point

- Turn 6: Nene plays 3, get 1 point

So, I get 2 points, but according to the program, it should be 1.

This suggests that the program's logic is incomplete.

Alternatively, perhaps in optimal play, Nene can prevent me from getting more than one point.

Let me try:

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 3, no point

- Turn 3: I play 1, get 1 point

- Turn 4: Nene plays 3, get 1 point

- Turn 5: I play 2, get 1 point

- Turn 6: Nene plays 2, get 1 point

So, I get 1 point from the pair and 1 point from the single, totaling 2 points.

Alternatively, Nene could play differently:

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 2, no point

- Turn 3: I play 1, get 1 point

- Turn 4: Nene plays 3, no point

- Turn 5: I play 2, get 1 point

- Turn 6: Nene plays 3, get 1 point

Again, I get 2 points.

It seems that regardless of how Nene plays, I can get 2 points.

But according to the program's logic, it should be 1.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Let me think of another approach.

Maybe the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, plus some additional points from singles if Nene doesn't play optimally.

But Nene is playing optimally to minimize my points, so she will prevent me from getting points from singles.

Hence, perhaps the program's logic is correct, and in the earlier simulation, I was getting more points due to Nene's suboptimal play.

But in reality, Nene can play in a way that I only get points from my pairs.

Let me think of another test case.

n=4

My hand:1,1,2,3

Nene's hand:2,3,4,4

According to the program, I have one pair, so max_score=1.

Let's see if Nene can play to prevent me from getting more than one point.

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 4, no point

- Turn 3: I play 1, get 1 point

- Turn 4: Nene plays 4, get 1 point

- Turn 5: I play 2, no point (since Nene played 4, not 2)

- Turn 6: Nene plays 2, no point

- Turn 7: I play 3, no point

- Turn 8: Nene plays 3, get 1 point

In this case, I only get 1 point, which matches the program's output.

Another simulation:

- Turn 1: I play 1, no point

- Turn 2: Nene plays 2, no point

- Turn 3: I play 1, get 1 point

- Turn 4: Nene plays 3, no point

- Turn 5: I play 2, get 1 point

- Turn 6: Nene plays 3, get 1 point

- Turn 7: I play 3, get 1 point

- Turn 8: Nene plays 4, no point

- Turn 9: I play 4, get 1 point

- Turn 0: Nene plays 4, get 1 point

Wait, but in this case, I get 2 points, but according to the program, it's 1.

But perhaps Nene can play optimally to prevent me from getting more than one point.

In the first simulation, I only get one point, which matches the program's output.

Hence, perhaps the program's logic is correct, and in optimal play, I can only get points from my pairs.

Hence, the program is correct.

But in one simulation, I got more points, but that might be because Nene didn't play optimally.

Given that Nene plays optimally, she can prevent me from getting points from singles.

Hence, the program is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points we can get by playing our cards optimally in a game where both players select cards to maximize their own scores, with one player trying to minimize the opponent's score as a secondary objective.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We have a deck of `2n` cards with integers from 1 to n, each appearing exactly twice.
   - The deck is divided equally between two players.
   - Players take turns placing one card at a time on the table, scoring a point if a card with the same number is already on the table.

2. **Insight**:
   - To maximize points, we should focus on pairs of cards we hold. If we have two cards of the same number, we can play them in such a way that the second one scores a point.
   - Nene, playing optimally, will try to minimize our points by disrupting our ability to score from single cards.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - We can guarantee a point for each pair of cards we hold because we can control when to play the second card of the pair.
   - For single cards, Nene can prevent us from scoring by managing what she plays, ensuring that the card we play doesn't have a match on the table.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - Count the frequency of each number in our hand.
   - For each number, if we have two cards, we can score one point from that pair.

### Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(a, n)
    results.append(result)
for res in results:
    print(res)

def func_1(a, n):
    count_a = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in count_a:
            count_a[num] += 1
        else:
            count_a[num] = 1
    max_score = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if num in count_a:
            if count_a[num] == 2:
                max_score += 1
    return max_score
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` (number of cards each player has) and the list of cards in our hand.

2. **Frequency Count**:
   - Use a dictionary `count_a` to count how many times each number appears in our hand.

3. **Calculate Maximum Score**:
   - For each number from 1 to n, if we have exactly two cards of that number, we can score one point from that pair.
   - Sum these potential points to get `max_score`.

4. **Output Results**:
   - Store results for all test cases and print them.

This approach ensures that we maximize our score based on the pairs we hold, considering Nene's optimal play to minimize our score beyond these pairs.
