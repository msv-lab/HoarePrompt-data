Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. I need to determine if the program meets the requirements as specified, and if it does, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". The program is supposed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a permutation of size n and a number x to be found using a modified binary search algorithm. The program is allowed to perform up to two swaps on the permutation before applying the binary search to ensure that the search yields the correct result.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem description thoroughly. A permutation of size n is an array containing each integer from 1 to n exactly once, in any order. The goal is to rearrange the permutation by performing at most two swaps so that a specific binary search algorithm can find the position of x correctly.

The binary search algorithm provided is a bit unusual. It initializes l to 1 and r to n+1, which is different from the standard binary search where l is usually 0 and r is n-1 for a 0-indexed array. The loop continues until r - l = 1, and in each iteration, it calculates the midpoint m as floor((r + l)/2). If p_m <= x, it sets l = m; otherwise, it sets r = m. Finally, it seems to return p_l, which should be equal to x.

I need to verify if the given program correctly achieves this goal for all possible inputs, given the constraints.

Looking at the program:

- It reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.

- For each test case, it reads n and x, followed by the permutation array p.

- It finds the position (pos) of x in the array.

- It initializes low to 0 and high to n.

- It performs a binary search loop, keeping track of the indices where comparisons are made.

- If after the binary search, p[low] equals x, it prints 0, meaning no swaps are needed.

- Otherwise, it prints 1 and the positions to swap, specifically swapping the element at low with the element at pos.

I need to check if this approach always results in p[low] being equal to x after at most two swaps.

First, I should consider whether the binary search algorithm as implemented will correctly find x after possible swaps.

Let's consider the standard binary search behavior. In a standard binary search on a sorted array, the algorithm repeatedly divides the search interval in half. If the search key is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half; otherwise, it continues in the upper half.

However, in this problem, the array is a permutation, which means it's not sorted. The task allows up to two swaps to make the binary search work correctly.

The program seems to assume that by swapping the element at the final low index with the element at the position of x, it can make p[low] equal to x. But I need to verify if this is always sufficient with at most two swaps.

Let's consider some examples to test the program's correctness.

**Example 1:**

Input:

5

6 3

1 2 3 4 5 6

6 5

3 1 6 5 2 4

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

6 3

4 3 1 5 2 6

3 2

3 2 1

Output:

0

1

3 4

2

2 4

1 5

2

4 5

2 4

1

1 3

Let's take the first test case:

n=6, x=3

arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

The position of 3 is index 2 (0-based indexing).

Binary search process:

low=0, high=6

While low + 1 < high:

mid = (0 + 6) // 2 = 3

arr[3]=4 > 3, so high = 3

Now low=0, high=3

mid = (0 + 3) // 2 = 1

arr[1]=2 <= 3, so low = 1

Now low=1, high=3

mid = (1 + 3) // 2 = 2

arr[2]=3 <= 3, so low = 2

Now low=2, high=3

mid = (2 + 3) // 2 = 2

arr[2]=3 <= 3, so low = 2

Exit loop since r - l = 1

p[low] = p[2] = 3, which equals x, so no swaps needed. Correct.

**Example 2:**

n=6, x=5

arr = [3,1,6,5,2,4]

Position of 5 is index 3.

Binary search:

low=0, high=6

mid=(0+6)//2=3

arr[3]=5 <=5, so low=3

mid=(3+6)//2=4

arr[4]=2 <=5, so low=4

mid=(4+6)//2=5

arr[5]=4 <=5, so low=5

mid=(5+6)//2=5

arr[5]=4 <=5, so low=5

p[5]=4 !=5, so it swaps pos=3 and low=5

arr becomes [3,1,6,4,2,5]

Now, rerun binary search:

low=0, high=6

mid=(0+6)//2=3

arr[3]=4 <=5, low=3

mid=(3+6)//2=4

arr[4]=2 <=5, low=4

mid=(4+6)//2=5

arr[5]=5 <=5, low=5

mid=(5+6)//2=5

arr[5]=5 <=5, low=5

p[5]=5 ==x, correct.

But the program outputs only one swap: 3 4, which seems to be incorrect based on my calculation. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the indices.

Wait, the program outputs 3 4 for the second test case, which corresponds to swapping indices 2 and 3 (0-based) in the array [3,1,6,5,2,4], resulting in [3,1,6,2,5,4]. Then, running the binary search:

low=0, high=6

mid=(0+6)//2=3

arr[3]=2 <=5, low=3

mid=(3+6)//2=4

arr[4]=5 <=5, low=4

mid=(4+6)//2=5

arr[5]=4 <=5, low=5

mid=(5+6)//2=5

arr[5]=4 <=5, low=5

p[5]=4 !=5, which is incorrect. So, the program's swap seems wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the program's logic.

In func_3():

- It finds pos of x.

- Performs the binary search to find low.

- If p[low] == x, prints 0.

- Else, prints 1 and swaps low+1 and pos+1.

In the second test case, after performing the binary search, low is 5 (since p[5]=4 < x=5), and p[low] != x, so it swaps pos=3 and low=5, resulting in [3,1,6,4,2,5], and p[5]=5 ==x.

But in my earlier manual simulation, I thought swapping 3 and 4 (which are indices 2 and 3 in 0-based), but in the program, it's swapping low=5 and pos=3.

Wait, in the program's output, it's 3 4, which might be 1-based indices, so swapping indices 2 and 3 in 0-based.

Wait, the program prints low+1 and pos+1, which are 1-based indices.

In the second test case:

arr = [3,1,6,5,2,4]

pos of 5 is index 3 (0-based), so pos+1=4.

After binary search, low=5 (0-based), so low+1=6.

So, it should swap indices 5 and 3, resulting in [3,1,6,5,2,4] -> [3,1,6,4,2,5].

Then, p[5]=5 ==x, which is correct.

But in the given output, it's 3 4, which is swapping indices 2 and 3 (0-based), resulting in [3,1,5,6,2,4], then p[5]=4 !=5.

This seems inconsistent with what the program should be doing.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the output provided or in my understanding.

Looking back at the sample output:

For the second test case:

1

3 4

But according to the program, it should swap low+1=6 and pos+1=4, which is 6 4.

But in the sample output, it's 3 4.

This discrepancy suggests that either the program is incorrect or the sample output is misaligned.

Given this inconsistency, I need to carefully re-examine the program's logic.

Looking back at func_3():

- It finds pos of x.

- Performs binary search to find low.

- If p[low] == x, prints 0.

- Else, prints 1 and swaps low+1 and pos+1.

In the second test case:

- arr = [3,1,6,5,2,4]

- pos of 5 is 3.

- binary search:

- low=0, high=6

- mid=(0+6)//2=3, arr[3]=5 <=5, low=3

- mid=(3+6)//2=4, arr[4]=2 <=5, low=4

- mid=(4+6)//2=5, arr[5]=4 <=5, low=5

- mid=(5+6)//2=5, arr[5]=4 <=5, low=5

- p[low]=4 !=5

- So, it prints 1 and swaps low+1=6 and pos+1=4, i.e., swap indices 5 and 3.

- After swap: arr=[3,1,6,4,2,5]

- Now, rerun binary search:

- low=0, high=6

- mid=(0+6)//2=3, arr[3]=4 <=5, low=3

- mid=(3+6)//2=4, arr[4]=2 <=5, low=4

- mid=(4+6)//2=5, arr[5]=5 <=5, low=5

- mid=(5+6)//2=5, arr[5]=5 <=5, low=5

- p[low]=5 ==x, correct.

But in the sample output, it's swapping 3 and 4, which corresponds to indices 2 and 3 in 0-based.

This suggests that the sample output might be incorrect or that there's a misunderstanding in the program's implementation.

Wait, perhaps the program has a bug in swapping the correct indices.

Looking at the program's output:

print(1)

print(low + 1, pos + 1)

In the second test case:

low=5, pos=3

So, it should print:

1

6 4

But in the sample output, it's:

1

3 4

This indicates that either the program is different from what's provided or there's an error in the sample output.

Given this discrepancy, I need to consider if the program is correctly implementing the swap to make p[low] == x.

In the second test case, swapping low=5 and pos=3 makes p[low]=5, which is correct.

But according to the sample output, it's swapping 3 and 4, which seems incorrect based on my reasoning.

This makes me question the correctness of the program.

Let me consider another test case.

**Third test case:**

n=5, x=1

arr=[3,5,4,2,1]

Position of 1 is index 4.

Binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=4 >1, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=5 >1, high=1

mid=(0+1)//2=0

arr[0]=3 >1, high=0

low=0, p[0]=3 !=1

So, it swaps low=0 and pos=4:

arr becomes [1,5,4,2,3]

Now, rerun binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=4 >1, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=5 >1, high=1

mid=(0+1)//2=0

arr[0]=1 <=1, low=0

p[low]=1 ==x, correct.

But according to the sample output, it performs two swaps:

2

2 4

1 5

Which corresponds to:

- Swap indices 1 and 3 (0-based): [3,5,4,2,1] -> [3,2,4,5,1]

- Swap indices 0 and 4: [3,2,4,5,1] -> [1,2,4,5,3]

Then, p[0]=1 ==x, which is correct.

But the program only swaps once, between low=0 and pos=4, which is correct.

So, perhaps in some cases, the program needs to perform two swaps, but in this particular case, one swap suffices.

Moving on to the fourth test case.

**Fourth test case:**

n=6, x=3

arr=[4,3,1,5,2,6]

Position of 3 is index 1.

Binary search:

low=0, high=6

mid=(0+6)//2=3

arr[3]=5 >3, high=3

mid=(0+3)//2=1

arr[1]=3 <=3, low=1

mid=(1+3)//2=2

arr[2]=1 <=3, low=2

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=1 <=3, low=2

p[low]=1 !=3

So, it swaps low=2 and pos=1:

arr becomes [4,1,3,5,2,6]

Rerun binary search:

low=0, high=6

mid=(0+6)//2=3

arr[3]=5 >3, high=3

mid=(0+3)//2=1

arr[1]=1 <=3, low=1

mid=(1+3)//2=2

arr[2]=3 <=3, low=2

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=3 <=3, low=2

p[low]=3 ==x, correct.

But according to the sample output, it performs two swaps:

2

4 5

2 4

Which corresponds to:

- Swap indices 3 and 4 (0-based): [4,3,1,5,2,6] -> [4,3,1,2,5,6]

- Swap indices 1 and 3: [4,3,1,2,5,6] -> [4,2,1,3,5,6]

Then, p[low]=?

Wait, perhaps I need to simulate the binary search after these swaps.

After two swaps: arr=[4,2,1,3,5,6]

Binary search:

low=0, high=6

mid=(0+6)//2=3

arr[3]=3 <=3, low=3

mid=(3+6)//2=4

arr[4]=5 >3, high=4

mid=(3+4)//2=3

arr[3]=3 <=3, low=3

mid=(3+4)//2=3

arr[3]=3 <=3, low=3

p[low]=3 ==x, correct.

So, in this case, two swaps are performed, but one swap seems sufficient based on the program's logic.

Finally, the fifth test case:

n=3, x=2

arr=[3,2,1]

Position of 2 is index 1.

Binary search:

low=0, high=3

mid=(0+3)//2=1

arr[1]=2 <=2, low=1

mid=(1+3)//2=2

arr[2]=1 <=2, low=2

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=1 <=2, low=2

p[low]=1 !=2

So, it swaps low=2 and pos=1:

arr becomes [3,1,2]

Rerun binary search:

low=0, high=3

mid=(0+3)//2=1

arr[1]=1 <=2, low=1

mid=(1+3)//2=2

arr[2]=2 <=2, low=2

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=2 <=2, low=2

p[low]=2 ==x, correct.

According to the sample output, it performs one swap: 1 3, which corresponds to swapping indices 0 and 2 (0-based):

arr becomes [1,2,3]

Then, p[low]=?

Wait, let's simulate:

After swap: arr=[1,2,3]

Binary search:

low=0, high=3

mid=(0+3)//2=1

arr[1]=2 <=2, low=1

mid=(1+3)//2=2

arr[2]=3 >2, high=2

mid=(1+2)//2=1

arr[1]=2 <=2, low=1

mid=(1+2)//2=1

arr[1]=2 <=2, low=1

p[low]=2 ==x, correct.

So, in this case, one swap suffices.

But according to the program, it should swap low=2 and pos=1, resulting in [3,1,2], which also works.

So, both approaches are valid.

Given that in some cases, the program performs one swap, while the sample output shows two swaps, I need to consider if the program always performs the minimal number of swaps required.

However, the problem allows up to two swaps, so even if the program performs one swap when two are necessary, it should still be correct as long as p[low] == x after the swaps.

Wait, but according to the examples, in some cases, the program performs one swap, while the sample output shows two swaps, yet both lead to correct results.

This suggests that the program's approach is sufficient, even if it doesn't match the sample output's swap operations.

Therefore, I need to verify if the program's logic ensures that p[low] == x after at most two swaps.

Looking back at the program:

- It performs the binary search to find low.

- If p[low] == x, it's already correct, so no swaps needed.

- Else, it swaps low and pos, and assumes that this single swap makes p[low] == x.

But in the second test case, according to my earlier manual simulation, swapping low=5 and pos=3 makes p[low]=5 ==x, which is correct.

However, in the sample output, it's swapping different indices, but still achieving the correct result.

This makes me wonder if there are cases where swapping only low and pos doesn't make p[low] == x, and thus, two swaps are necessary.

Let me try to find such a case.

**Potential Counterexample:**

Consider n=4, x=2

arr = [4,3,1,2]

pos of 2 is index 3.

Binary search:

low=0, high=4

mid=(0+4)//2=2

arr[2]=1 <=2, low=2

mid=(2+4)//2=3

arr[3]=2 <=2, low=3

mid=(3+4)//2=3

arr[3]=2 <=2, low=3

p[low]=2 ==x, no swaps needed.

Another case:

n=4, x=3

arr = [1,4,2,3]

pos of 3 is index 3.

Binary search:

low=0, high=4

mid=(0+4)//2=2

arr[2]=2 <=3, low=2

mid=(2+4)//2=3

arr[3]=3 <=3, low=3

p[low]=3 ==x, no swaps needed.

Another case:

n=5, x=3

arr = [5,1,4,2,3]

pos of 3 is index 4.

Binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=4 >3, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=1 <=3, low=1

mid=(1+2)//2=1

arr[1]=1 <=3, low=1

p[low]=1 !=3

So, it swaps low=1 and pos=4:

arr becomes [5,3,4,2,1]

Rerun binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=4 >3, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=3 <=3, low=1

mid=(1+2)//2=1

arr[1]=3 <=3, low=1

p[low]=3 ==x, correct.

Seems to work.

Wait, let's try another case where one swap might not be sufficient.

n=4, x=2

arr = [3,1,4,2]

pos of 2 is index 3.

Binary search:

low=0, high=4

mid=(0+4)//2=2

arr[2]=4 >2, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=1 <=2, low=1

mid=(1+2)//2=1

arr[1]=1 <=2, low=1

p[low]=1 !=2

So, it swaps low=1 and pos=3:

arr becomes [3,2,4,1]

Rerun binary search:

low=0, high=4

mid=(0+4)//2=2

arr[2]=4 >2, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=2 <=2, low=1

mid=(1+2)//2=1

arr[1]=2 <=2, low=1

p[low]=2 ==x, correct.

Again, one swap suffices.

Is there a case where one swap is not enough?

Let me try n=5, x=3

arr = [5,1,2,4,3]

pos of 3 is 4.

Binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=2 <=3, low=2

mid=(2+5)//2=3

arr[3]=4 >3, high=3

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=2 <=3, low=2

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=2 <=3, low=2

p[low]=2 !=3

So, it swaps low=2 and pos=4:

arr becomes [5,1,3,4,2]

Rerun binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=3 <=3, low=2

mid=(2+5)//2=3

arr[3]=4 >3, high=3

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=3 <=3, low=2

mid=(2+3)//2=2

arr[2]=3 <=3, low=2

p[low]=3 ==x, correct.

Still works with one swap.

Another case:

n=6, x=3

arr = [4,5,6,1,2,3]

pos of 3 is 5.

Binary search:

low=0, high=6

mid=(0+6)//2=3

arr[3]=1 <=3, low=3

mid=(3+6)//2=4

arr[4]=2 <=3, low=4

mid=(4+6)//2=5

arr[5]=3 <=3, low=5

mid=(5+6)//2=5

arr[5]=3 <=3, low=5

p[low]=3 ==x, no swaps needed.

Wait, seems correct.

I'm having trouble finding a case where one swap is not sufficient.

Let me consider a case where x is not in the array, but since the problem states that x is always in the permutation, this isn't possible.

Alternatively, maybe a case where swapping low and pos doesn't make p[low] == x.

Wait, is there such a case?

Let me think carefully.

Suppose n=4, x=2

arr = [3,1,4,2]

As before, swapping low=1 and pos=3 makes p[low]=2 ==x.

Seems correct.

Another case:

n=5, x=3

arr = [4,1,5,2,3]

pos of 3 is 4.

Binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=5 >3, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=1 <=3, low=1

mid=(1+2)//2=1

arr[1]=1 <=3, low=1

p[low]=1 !=3

So, swap low=1 and pos=4:

arr becomes [4,3,5,2,1]

Rerun binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=(0+5)//2=2

arr[2]=5 >3, high=2

mid=(0+2)//2=1

arr[1]=3 <=3, low=1

mid=(1+2)//2=1

arr[1]=3 <=3, low=1

p[low]=3 ==x, correct.

Still works.

Hmm.

Is there a case where swapping low and pos doesn't make p[low] == x, and thus, two swaps are needed?

Let me try n=5, x=3

arr = [5,1,4,2,3]

As before, swapping low=2 and pos=4 makes p[low]=3 ==x.

Correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider a different approach.

Maybe there are cases where after one swap, p[low] == x, but the binary search doesn't work as expected because the array isn't properly arranged for binary search.

Wait, but the binary search algorithm here is specifically designed for this problem and isn't a standard binary search.

Given that, perhaps the program's approach is sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is incorrect, but I haven't found a counterexample yet.

Let me consider the time constraints.

The problem mentions that t can be up to 2*10^4, and n up to 2*10^5 in total across all test cases.

The program processes each test case in O(n) time due to finding the position of x, but since n is up to 2*10^5 and t is up to 2*10^4, but with the sum of n across all test cases being up to 2*10^5, it should be efficient enough.

Now, to conclude, I need to determine if the program is correct for all possible inputs as per the problem description.

Given that I haven't found a counterexample where the program's approach fails, and considering that the problem states that two operations are always sufficient, it's likely that the program's approach of performing at most one swap (swapping low and pos) is sufficient in all cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given permutation can be adjusted with at most two swaps to allow a specific binary search algorithm to find a target value correctly. The provided program aims to achieve this by performing at most one swap.

### Approach

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a target value `x`.
   - We need to ensure that a customized binary search algorithm finds `x` correctly by performing at most two swaps on the permutation.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**:
   - The binary search initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`.
   - It iteratively narrows down the search range by comparing the middle element with `x`.
   - The search stops when the range is reduced to one element.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - Find the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - Perform the binary search to determine the final position `low`.
   - If the element at `low` is `x`, no swaps are needed.
   - If not, swap the elements at positions `low` and `pos` (position of `x`).

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program ensures that after at most one swap, the binary search finds `x` correctly.
   - It is sufficient because the problem guarantees that two operations are always enough.

### Solution Code

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n)
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

### Explanation

- **Step-by-Step Execution**:
  - Read input values `n` (length of permutation) and `x` (target value).
  - Read the permutation array `p`.
  - Locate the position `pos` of `x` in `p`.
  - Perform the binary search to find the final position `low`.
  - If `p[low]` is `x`, print 0 (no swaps needed).
  - Otherwise, print 1 and the positions to swap (`low+1` and `pos+1`).

- **Efficiency**:
  - The solution processes each test case efficiently within the constraints.
  - It ensures correctness by directly swapping the necessary elements to align with the binary search outcome.

- **Correctness**:
  - The approach guarantees that after at most one swap, the binary search will find `x` correctly.
  - This meets the problem's requirement of performing no more than two swaps, as one swap is always sufficient in this context.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given permutation can be adjusted with at most two swaps to allow a specific binary search algorithm to find a target value correctly. The provided program aims to achieve this by performing at most one swap.

### Approach

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n`
