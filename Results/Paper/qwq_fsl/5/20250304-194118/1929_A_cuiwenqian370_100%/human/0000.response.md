Alright, I've been assigned the role of a program verifier. My task is to determine whether a given Python program correctly meets the requirements specified in the problem description. If the program is correct for all potential cases, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all possible edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

First, let's understand the problem description. Sasha wants to rearrange an array to maximize its "beauty," which is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. I need to help Sasha find the maximum possible beauty value after rearranging the array in any way.

Looking at the program provided, it seems to sort the array and then calculate the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. But wait, the beauty is defined as (a_i - a_{i-1}), not the absolute difference. So, there might be a misunderstanding here.

Let me read the problem again carefully. The beauty is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n. So, if the array is [a1, a2, a3, ..., an], beauty = (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}). If I expand this, most terms cancel out, and it simplifies to (an - a1). So, the beauty is simply the last element minus the first element after rearrangement.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify this. If I have an array [a, b, c], beauty = (b - a) + (c - b) = c - a. So yes, it's just the last element minus the first element after rearrangement.

Therefore, to maximize the beauty, Sasha should arrange the array such that the last element is as large as possible and the first element is as small as possible. So, sorting the array in ascending order and then taking the last element minus the first element should give the maximum beauty.

Looking back at the program, func_1 sorts the array and then sums up the absolute differences between consecutive elements. But according to my reasoning, it should just compute the difference between the last and first elements after sorting.

Let me check with the example provided:

Input:

5

3

2 1 3

3

69 69 69

5

100 54 80 43 90

4

3 4 3 3

2

2 1

Expected Output:

2

0

57

1

1

Let's see for the first test case:

Array: [2,1,3]

Sorted: [1,2,3]

Beauty should be 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the expected output.

Second test case:

Array: [69,69,69]

Sorted: [69,69,69]

Beauty: 69 - 69 = 0, correct.

Third test case:

Array: [100,54,80,43,90]

Sorted: [43,54,80,90,100]

Beauty: 100 - 43 = 57, correct.

Fourth test case:

Array: [3,4,3,3]

Sorted: [3,3,3,4]

Beauty: 4 - 3 = 1, correct.

Fifth test case:

Array: [2,1]

Sorted: [1,2]

Beauty: 2 - 1 = 1, correct.

So, all the example cases seem to work correctly. But I need to ensure that the program works for all possible cases, not just these examples.

Let me think about some edge cases:

1. All elements are the same: For example, [5,5,5,5]. Beauty should be 0, since regardless of the arrangement, the difference between any two consecutive elements is 0.

2. Array with only two elements: For example, [10, 20]. Beauty should be 20 - 10 = 10.

3. Array with negative numbers: For example, [-1, -3, -2]. Sorted: [-3, -2, -1]. Beauty: -1 - (-3) = 2.

4. Array with mixed positive and negative numbers: For example, [-5, 0, 5]. Sorted: [-5, 0, 5]. Beauty: 5 - (-5) = 10.

5. Array already sorted in descending order: For example, [10, 5, 1]. Sorted: [1,5,10]. Beauty:10 -1=9.

6. Array with a single unique element repeated: For example, [7,7,7,7]. Beauty:0.

Now, let's see if the program handles these cases correctly.

Take the first edge case: [5,5,5,5]

Sorted: [5,5,5,5]

Beauty:5-5=0, which is correct.

Second edge case: [10,20]

Sorted: [10,20]

Beauty:20-10=10, correct.

Third edge case: [-1,-3,-2]

Sorted: [-3,-2,-1]

Beauty:-1 - (-3)=2, correct.

Fourth edge case: [-5,0,5]

Sorted: [-5,0,5]

Beauty:5 - (-5)=10, correct.

Fifth edge case: [10,5,1]

Sorted: [1,5,10]

Beauty:10-1=9, correct.

Sixth edge case: [7,7,7,7]

Sorted: [7,7,7,7]

Beauty:7-7=0, correct.

So, these edge cases seem to be handled correctly. But I need to make sure that the program is calculating the beauty correctly as per the problem description.

Wait a minute, in the program, func_1 sorts the array and then sums up the absolute differences between consecutive elements. But according to the problem, beauty is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), which, as I saw earlier, simplifies to a_n - a_1 after sorting.

However, in the program, it's summing up the absolute differences, which would be sum of |a_i - a_{i-1}| for sorted array.

But according to the problem, it's sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) without absolute value.

In the examples provided, since the array is sorted in ascending order, a_i - a_{i-1} is positive, so sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) equals sum of |a_i - a_{i-1}|. That's why the program's output matches the expected output in the examples.

But is this always the case? Let's consider an array with decreasing order.

For example, array: [4,3,2,1]

Sorted: [1,2,3,4]

Beauty:4-1=3

If we calculate sum of |a_i - a_{i-1}|: |2-1| + |3-2| + |4-3| =1+1+1=3, which matches a_n - a_1.

Another example: [1,3,2]

Sorted: [1,2,3]

Beauty:3-1=2

Sum of |a_i - a_{i-1}|=|2-1| + |3-2|=1+1=2, again matches.

So, in ascending order, sum of |a_i - a_{i-1}| equals a_n - a_1.

But what if the array is sorted in descending order?

Array: [4,3,2,1]

Sorted descending: [4,3,2,1]

Beauty:1 -4 = -3, but sum of |a_i - a_{i-1}|=|3-4| + |2-3| + |1-2|=1+1+1=3, which is different from beauty value of -3.

Wait, but according to the problem, we are to rearrange the array to maximize beauty, which is sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n.

So, to maximize beauty, we need to maximize (a_n - a_1), since sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) simplifies to a_n - a_1.

Therefore, to maximize a_n - a_1, we should have a_n as large as possible and a_1 as small as possible, which is achieved by sorting the array in ascending order.

But in the program, func_1 sorts the array and calculates sum of |a_i - a_{i-1}|, which coincidentally equals a_n - a_1 for ascending order.

But in descending order, sum of |a_i - a_{i-1}| equals sum of (a_{i-1} - a_i), which is a_1 - a_n, which is not what we want.

But since we are sorting in ascending order, it should be fine.

Wait, but in the program, it sorts the array in ascending order, and then sums up |a_i - a_{i-1}|, which equals a_n - a_1.

So, it works correctly for ascending order.

But according to the problem, we can rearrange the array in any way to maximize beauty.

And as per my earlier reasoning, sorting in ascending order maximizes beauty.

Hence, the program seems correct.

But I need to confirm if there's any case where sum of |a_i - a_{i-1}| doesn't equal a_n - a_1 for ascending order.

Wait, in ascending order, a_i >= a_{i-1}, so a_i - a_{i-1} >=0, hence |a_i - a_{i-1}| = a_i - a_{i-1}.

Therefore, sum of |a_i - a_{i-1}| = sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) = a_n - a_1.

Hence, in ascending order, sum of |a_i - a_{i-1}| equals a_n - a_1.

So, the program is correct.

But perhaps there's a simpler way to compute beauty: just compute a_n - a_1 after sorting.

But in the program, it's summing up the absolute differences, which is equivalent.

Therefore, the program is correct.

I can't find any case where this would fail.

Hence, Correctness: **True**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The optimal approach is to sort the array in ascending order, which ensures that the sum of differences between consecutive elements is maximized.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Beauty Calculation**:
   - The beauty of an array is calculated as \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).
   - This sum simplifies to \(a_n - a_1\), where \(a_n\) is the last element and \(a_1\) is the first element in the sorted array.

2. **Optimal Arrangement**:
   - Sorting the array in ascending order maximizes \(a_n - a_1\), thereby maximizing the beauty.

3. **Implementation**:
   - For each test case, sort the array and compute the beauty as the difference between the last and first elements.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = array[-1] - array[0]
    return beauty

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()
```

### Explanation

1. **func_1**:
   - Takes an array, sorts it, and calculates the beauty as the difference between the last and first elements.

2. **func_2**:
   - Reads input data from standard input.
   - Processes each test case by extracting the array and computing its beauty using `func_1`.
   - Collects and prints the results for all test cases.

This approach ensures that the beauty is maximized by arranging the array in ascending order and directly computing the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is the simplest and most efficient way to solve the problem.
