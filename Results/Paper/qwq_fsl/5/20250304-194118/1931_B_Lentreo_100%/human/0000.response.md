Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a lower index to one with a higher index. The sum of the water amounts is guaranteed to be divisible by the number of containers, which means there is a target amount each container should have.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. We have n containers, each containing a certain amount of water. We can only pour water from a container with a smaller index to a larger one. The goal is to make sure every container has the same amount of water, and we need to decide if this is possible with the given operation.

The program provided is:

```python

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

    n = int(input())

    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

    print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):

    n = len(nums)

    total = sum(nums)

    if total % n != 0:

        return 'NO'

    mean = total // n

    curr = 0

    for i in range(n):

        curr += nums[i] - mean

        if curr < 0:

            return 'NO'

    return 'YES'

```

Let's break this down.

1. **Reading Input:**

   - The first line reads the number of test cases, t.

   - For each test case:

     - Read the number of containers, n.

     - Read the list of water amounts in the containers, nums.

   - Then, for each test case, it calls `func_1(nums)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**

   - Calculate the total sum of water in all containers.

   - Check if the total sum is divisible by the number of containers. If not, return 'NO'. (Though, according to the problem, the sum is always divisible by n, so this check might be redundant.)

   - Calculate the target amount of water each container should have (mean).

   - Initialize a variable `curr` to keep track of the cumulative difference from the mean.

   - Iterate through the containers from left to right:

     - For each container, adjust `curr` by adding the difference between its current water amount and the mean.

     - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, return 'NO'.

   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, return 'YES'.

Given that the sum is always divisible by n, the initial check `if total % n != 0` is unnecessary, but it doesn't harm the correctness.

The key part is the cumulative sum approach. The variable `curr` represents the cumulative excess or deficit of water up to the current container, considering the target mean.

The logic seems to be that for the operation to be possible, at no point should the cumulative water up to any container be less than what is required to reach the mean for those containers. In other words, we shouldn't have a deficit that can't be compensated by future containers.

To verify this, let's consider the examples provided:

**Example 1:**

Input:

6

1

43

Output: YES

Explanation: Only one container, already at the target.

Program's output: YES

**Example 2:**

Input:

2

1 3

Output: NO

Explanation: To make both containers have 2 units, we'd need to pour 1 unit from container 2 to container 1. But since pouring can only be from a lower index to a higher one, this operation isn't allowed. So, it's impossible.

Program's output: NO

**Example 3:**

Input:

5

4 5 2 1 3

Output: YES

Explanation: As described in the note, it's possible to make all containers have 3 units by pouring water from certain containers to others, respecting the direction constraint.

Program's output: YES

**Example 4:**

Input:

3

1 2 3

Output: NO

Explanation: To make all containers have 2 units, we'd need to pour from container 3 to container 1, but that violates the direction constraint (can't pour from a higher index to a lower one).

Program's output: NO

**Example 5:**

Input:

7

4 5 5 0 6 4 4

Output: NO

Explanation: It's not possible to make all containers have the same amount by only pouring from lower to higher indices.

Program's output: NO

**Example 6:**

Input:

7

6 5 5 1 3 4 4

Output: YES

Explanation: It's possible to adjust the water amounts by pouring only from lower to higher indices.

Program's output: YES

These examples seem consistent with the program's output.

Now, to ensure the program is correct in general, I need to think about whether this cumulative sum approach correctly captures the constraints of the problem.

Let's consider what the problem is asking. We need to make all containers have the same amount of water, and we can only pour water from a container with a smaller index to a larger one. This means that any water that is in a container with a higher index cannot be used to fill a container with a smaller index.

Given that, each container must have at least the target amount minus the sum of the deficits of all previous containers.

Wait, that sounds a bit convoluted. Let's think differently.

Suppose we have the target amount for each container is mean. For each container from left to right, we can choose to pour some water to the next container, but we can't receive water from previous containers.

So, for each container, the water it has minus the target should be less than or equal to the total excess water in the previous containers that can be poured forward.

But the program's approach seems to accumulate the difference from the mean and ensure it never goes negative.

Let me see if I can formalize this.

Let mean be the target amount for each container.

Define diff_i = nums[i] - mean for each container i.

We need to ensure that the cumulative sum of diff_i from i=0 to i=k is >= 0 for all k from 0 to n-1.

Because if at any point the cumulative sum is negative, it means we need water from a previous container to make up for the deficit, which is not allowed since we can only pour from earlier containers to later ones, not the other way around.

Hence, the program's approach seems correct.

Let me try to think of a counterexample where the program might fail.

Suppose we have n=3, and nums=[3, 2, 1], mean=2.

Calculate cumulative diffs:

- i=0: 3-2=1, curr=1

- i=1: 2-2=0, curr=1+0=1

- i=2: 1-2=-1, curr=1+(-1)=0

The program would see curr never goes negative, so it would return 'YES'.

But according to the problem, can we make all containers have 2?

- Start with [3,2,1]

- Pour from container 1 to container 3: [3,2,1] -> [2,2,2]. This is allowed because we're pouring from a lower index to a higher one.

So, in this case, it's possible, and the program correctly returns 'YES'.

Another test case: n=3, nums=[1,2,3], mean=2.

- i=0: 1-2=-1, curr=-1 < 0 -> return 'NO'

Indeed, it's impossible to make all containers have 2 because we can't pour water from container 3 to container 1 due to the direction constraint.

Another test case: n=4, nums=[4,0,0,4], mean=2.

- i=0: 4-2=2, curr=2

- i=1: 0-2=-2, curr=2 + (-2)=0

- i=2: 0-2=-2, curr=0 + (-2)=-2 < 0 -> 'NO'

Is this correct? Let's see.

We need to make each container have 2.

- Start with [4,0,0,4]

- Pour from container 1 to container 2: [3,1,0,4]

- Then from container 1 to container 3: [2,1,1,4]

- Then from container 4 to container 2: not allowed, since 4 > 2

- Alternatively, pour from container 4 to container 3: [2,1,2,3]

- Then from container 4 to container 2: [2,2,2,2]

Wait, but pouring from container 4 to container 2 is not allowed because 4 > 2.

So, it's impossible, and the program correctly returns 'NO'.

Another test case: n=4, nums=[3,1,2,4], mean=2.5

Wait, but mean must be an integer, since sum is divisible by n. Wait, the problem says the sum is divisible by n, so mean is an integer.

Wait, in this case, sum is 3+1+2+4=10, which is divisible by 4? No, 10 is not divisible by 4. So this case wouldn't occur.

Let me choose another test case where sum is divisible by n.

n=4, nums=[2,3,2,3], mean=2.5

Wait, sum is 10, which is not divisible by 4. So this won't work.

Another test case: n=4, nums=[1,2,3,4], sum=10, not divisible by 4.

n=4, nums=[2,2,2,2], sum=8, divisible by 4.

- i=0: 2-2=0, curr=0

- i=1: 2-2=0, curr=0+0=0

- i=2: 2-2=0, curr=0+0=0

- i=3: 2-2=0, curr=0+0=0

Returns 'YES', which is correct.

Another test case: n=5, nums=[5,0,0,0,0], mean=1

- i=0: 5-1=4, curr=4

- i=1: 0-1=-1, curr=4 + (-1)=3

- i=2: 0-1=-1, curr=3 + (-1)=2

- i=3: 0-1=-1, curr=2 + (-1)=1

- i=4: 0-1=-1, curr=1 + (-1)=0

Returns 'YES'

Is this possible?

We need to make all containers have 1.

- Start with [5,0,0,0,0]

- Pour from container 1 to container 2: [4,1,0,0,0]

- Pour from container 1 to container 3: [3,1,1,0,0]

- Pour from container 1 to container 4: [2,1,1,1,0]

- Pour from container 1 to container 5: [1,1,1,1,1]

So, it's possible, and the program correctly returns 'YES'.

Another test case: n=5, nums=[0,0,0,0,5], mean=1

- i=0: 0-1=-1, curr=-1 <0 -> 'NO'

Which is correct, because we can't pour water from container 5 to container 1 due to the direction constraint.

Seems like the program handles these cases correctly.

Let me think about another aspect. What if there are multiple ways to pour water, but some ways might lead to a negative cumulative sum, but others don't?

Wait, the program only checks one specific cumulative sum path, but since the operation is constrained to pouring only from lower to higher indices, and we're checking that the cumulative sum never goes negative, it seems to capture the essential condition.

I can't think of any case where the program would return 'YES' but it's actually impossible to equalize the water amounts, or return 'NO' when it's possible.

Hence, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
