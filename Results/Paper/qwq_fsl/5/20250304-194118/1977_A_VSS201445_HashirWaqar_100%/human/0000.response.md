Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. I need to determine whether the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". The key here is to ensure that the program works for every potential case as per the description. Partial correctness isn't acceptable; it has to be fully correct.

To understand this better, let's look at the examples provided.

**Example 1:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program:

```python

def is_not_prime(n):

    if n < 2:

        return True

    for i in range(2, n):

        if n % i == 0:

            return True

    return False

```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **True**

This seems straightforward. The function checks if a number is not prime by returning True if the number is less than 2 or if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. This aligns with the problem description.

**Example 2:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with the same characters.

- Program:

```python

def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):

    count = 0

    for i in range(len(s)-1):

        for j in range(i, len(s)-1):

            if s[i] == s[j+1]:

                count += 1

    return count

```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**

In this case, the answer is False, which suggests that the program doesn't correctly count all substrings starting and ending with the same character for every possible input. Maybe there's an edge case it misses.

**Example 3:**

- Problem Description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in a list.

- Program:

```python

def binary_search(arr, target):

    left = 0

    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left < right:

        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:

            return mid

        elif arr[mid] < target:

            left = mid

        else:

            right = mid - 1

    if arr[left] == target:

        return left

    return -1

```

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**

Again, the answer is False, indicating that this binary search implementation has a flaw. Perhaps it doesn't handle certain edge cases properly.

From these examples, it's clear that I need to thoroughly check if the given program adheres to the problem description for all possible cases.

Now, let's move on to my actual task.

**Your Task:**

- Problem Description:

The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly m cubes?

**Input**

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

**Output**

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive answer.

**Example**

Input:

3

3 3

2 4

5 3

Output:

Yes

No

Yes

**Note**

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

**Program:**

```python

def func():

    for _ in range(int(input())):

        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())

        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:

            print('YES')

        else:

            print('NO')

```

Alright, I need to verify if this program correctly determines whether it's possible for Nikita to have a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves.

First, let's understand the problem.

- Initially, there are 0 cubes.

- In each move, Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.

- We need to check if after n moves, the tower has exactly m cubes.

Let's think about the possible scenarios.

Each move can be either adding a cube (+1) or removing a cube (-1). So, after n moves, the number of cubes in the tower will be determined by the difference between the number of addition moves and removal moves.

Let's denote:

- a = number of addition moves

- r = number of removal moves

We have:

- a + r = n (total moves)

- m = a - r (since each addition adds 1 cube and each removal removes 1 cube)

From these equations:

- a = (m + n) / 2

- r = (n - m) / 2

For a and r to be integers (since you can't have fractional moves), (m + n) must be even, and (n - m) must be even.

Additionally, a and r must be non-negative, since you can't have negative moves.

So, the conditions are:

1. (m + n) is even

2. (n - m) is even

3. a = (m + n)/2 >= 0

4. r = (n - m)/2 >= 0

Wait, actually, since a and r are both >=0, and a + r = n, and m = a - r, we can derive the above.

But in the program provided, it checks:

if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

So, it checks two conditions:

1. n >= m

2. (n - m) is even

Is this sufficient?

Let's see.

From the equations:

a = (m + n)/2

r = (n - m)/2

Both a and r need to be integers and non-negative.

The program checks:

- n >= m: This ensures that r = (n - m)/2 >= 0

- (n - m) % 2 == 0: This ensures that r is an integer, and since a = (m + n)/2, and (n - m) is even, (m + n) is also even, so a is an integer.

So, the program seems to cover the necessary conditions.

But wait, what if n < m, but m is negative? Wait, in the problem, m is at least 1, as per the input constraints: 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100

Wait, no, in the problem description, m can be 0 or positive, but according to the input constraints, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.

Wait, the problem says: 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100

So, m can't be negative, as per the input constraints.

Hence, the conditions in the program seem sufficient.

Let's verify with some test cases.

**Test Case 1:**

Input:

3

3 3

2 4

5 3

Output:

Yes

No

Yes

As per the example, the program should output 'Yes' for the first and third test cases, and 'No' for the second.

Let's see:

1. n=3, m=3

- n >= m: 3 >= 3 → True

- (n - m) % 2 == 0: (3 - 3) % 2 == 0 → 0 % 2 == 0 → True

- So, output 'YES'

2. n=2, m=4

- n >= m: 2 >= 4 → False

- So, output 'NO'

3. n=5, m=3

- n >= m: 5 >= 3 → True

- (n - m) % 2 == 0: (5 - 3) % 2 == 0 → 2 % 2 == 0 → True

- So, output 'YES'

This matches the example output.

Let's think of some edge cases.

**Edge Case 1:**

n=1, m=1

- n >= m: 1 >= 1 → True

- (n - m) % 2 == 0: (1 - 1) % 2 == 0 → 0 % 2 == 0 → True

- Output 'YES'

Indeed, with one move, adding one cube, we get m=1.

**Edge Case 2:**

n=1, m=0

- n >= m: 1 >= 0 → True

- (n - m) % 2 == 0: (1 - 0) % 2 == 0 → 1 % 2 == 0 → False

- Output 'NO'

But wait, is this correct?

If n=1, m=0, meaning in one move, can Nikita remove one cube to have 0 cubes?

Initially, there are 0 cubes. If he removes one cube, he can't, because there are none to remove. So, it's impossible to have m=0 after n=1 move.

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

**Edge Case 3:**

n=2, m=0

- n >= m: 2 >= 0 → True

- (n - m) % 2 == 0: (2 - 0) % 2 == 0 → 2 % 2 == 0 → True

- Output 'YES'

Is this possible?

Move 1: Add one cube (tower has 1 cube)

Move 2: Remove one cube (tower has 0 cubes)

Yes, possible.

**Edge Case 4:**

n=3, m=2

- n >= m: 3 >= 2 → True

- (n - m) % 2 == 0: (3 - 2) % 2 == 0 → 1 % 2 == 0 → False

- Output 'NO'

Is this correct?

Let's see:

Possible sequences:

- Add, Add, Add: m=3

- Add, Add, Remove: m=2

- Add, Remove, Add: m=2

- Add, Remove, Remove: m=0

- Remove, Add, Add: m=2

- Remove, Add, Remove: m=0

- Remove, Remove, Add: m=0

- Remove, Remove, Remove: not possible, as initially 0 cubes.

So, m=2 is achievable. But according to the program, it would output 'NO' because (n - m) % 2 == 1.

This seems like a discrepancy.

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, a = (m + n)/2 = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5, which is not an integer. But in reality, as shown in the sequences, m=2 is achievable.

So, it seems the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the sequences above, m=2 is achievable, but according to the program, it should output 'NO' because (n - m) % 2 != 0.

This suggests that the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, I thought that a and r need to be integers, which in this case, a=2.5 is not an integer, so it shouldn't be possible. But the sequences show that m=2 is achievable.

Hmm, there's a contradiction here.

Let me think differently.

If n=3, m=2:

a + r = 3

a - r = 2

Solving:

a = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5

r = (3 - 2)/2 = 0.5

But number of moves must be integers, so this should not be possible. However, the sequences suggest otherwise.

Wait, but in reality, you can't have half moves, so it should be impossible.

But in the sequences above, it seems like m=2 is achievable. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sequences.

Let's re-examine the sequences for n=3:

1. Add, Add, Add: m=3

2. Add, Add, Remove: m=2

3. Add, Remove, Add: m=2

4. Add, Remove, Remove: m=0

5. Remove, Add, Add: m=2

6. Remove, Add, Remove: m=0

7. Remove, Remove, Add: m=0

8. Remove, Remove, Remove: not possible, as starting from 0.

Wait, in sequence 2: Add, Add, Remove: m=2

- Start with 0

- Add: 1

- Add: 2

- Remove: 1

Wait, m=1, not 2.

Similarly, sequence 3: Add, Remove, Add

- 0 → 1 → 0 → 1

m=1

Sequence 5: Remove, Add, Add

- Not possible to remove from 0, so invalid.

Wait, it seems I made a mistake in considering the sequences.

Actually, in sequences where removal is attempted before any addition, it's invalid because you can't remove from an empty tower.

So, let's correct the sequences:

Valid sequences for n=3:

1. Add, Add, Add: m=3

2. Add, Add, Remove: m=2

- 0 → 1 → 2 → 1

3. Add, Remove, Add: m=1

- 0 → 1 → 0 → 1

4. Add, Remove, Remove: invalid, as second remove would be from 0

5. Remove, Add, Add: invalid, as first remove from 0

6. Remove, Add, Remove: invalid

7. Remove, Remove, Add: invalid

8. Remove, Remove, Remove: invalid

So, only sequences 1 and 2 are valid, giving m=3 and m=1.

Thus, m=2 is not achievable in n=3 moves.

Therefore, the program correctly outputs 'NO' for n=3, m=2, which aligns with the corrected sequence analysis.

Hence, the program is correct in this case.

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, a=(m+n)/2 needs to be integer, which it isn't for m=2, n=3. So, it's correctly identified as impossible.

Therefore, the program seems correct.

Let's think of another test case.

**Test Case 4:**

n=4, m=2

- n >= m: 4 >= 2 → True

- (n - m) % 2 == 0: (4 - 2) % 2 == 0 → 2 % 2 == 0 → True

- Output 'YES'

Is this possible?

Possible sequences:

- Add, Add, Add, Remove: m=3

- Add, Add, Remove, Add: m=3

- Add, Remove, Add, Add: m=3

- Remove, Add, Add, Add: m=3

- Add, Add, Remove, Remove: m=1

- Add, Remove, Add, Remove: m=1

- Add, Remove, Remove, Add: m=1

- Remove, Add, Add, Remove: m=1

- Remove, Add, Remove, Add: m=1

- Remove, Remove, Add, Add: m=1

- Add, Remove, Remove, Remove: invalid

- Remove, Add, Remove, Remove: invalid

- Remove, Remove, Add, Remove: invalid

- Remove, Remove, Remove, Add: invalid

- Remove, Remove, Remove, Remove: invalid

- Add, Add, Add, Add: m=4

So, m=1 and m=3 and m=4 are achievable, but m=2 is not.

But according to the program, it would output 'YES' for m=2, which seems incorrect based on this analysis.

Wait, but according to the earlier conditions, a=(m+n)/2=(2+4)/2=3, which is integer, and r=(n-m)/2=(4-2)/2=1, which is integer and non-negative.

So, according to the program, it's possible, but from the sequences, it seems not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some sequences.

Let's try:

Sequence:

Add, Add, Remove, Add: m=3

Add, Remove, Add, Add: m=3

Remove, Add, Add, Add: m=3

Add, Add, Add, Remove: m=3

Add, Add, Remove, Remove: m=1

Add, Remove, Add, Remove: m=1

Add, Remove, Remove, Add: m=1

Remove, Add, Add, Remove: m=1

Remove, Add, Remove, Add: m=1

Remove, Remove, Add, Add: m=1

Add, Add, Add, Add: m=4

Seems like m=2 is not achievable in any of these sequences.

So, even though a and r are integers, in practice, m=2 is not achievable.

This suggests that the program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the earlier mathematical derivation, a and r being integers and non-negative should make m achievable.

But in practice, it's not achievable.

This discrepancy needs to be addressed.

Perhaps there's a flaw in the initial assumption.

Let's think differently.

Each sequence of moves can be represented as a string of 'A' (add) and 'R' (remove).

For n moves, it's a sequence of n 'A's and 'R's.

However, there's a constraint: you can't remove a cube if there are none.

So, the sequence must satisfy the condition that at no point does the number of 'R's exceed the number of 'A's up to that point.

This is similar to the concept of Dyck words in combinatorics, where the number of opening brackets must be at least the number of closing brackets at any point in the sequence.

Given this constraint, not all sequences with a certain number of 'A's and 'R's are valid.

Hence, even if a and r are integers and satisfy a + r = n and m = a - r, the sequence must also respect the ordering constraint.

In the case of n=3, m=2:

a = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5, which is not an integer, so m=2 is not achievable, which aligns with the program's 'NO'.

Wait, but in n=4, m=2:

a = (4 + 2)/2 = 3

r = (4 - 2)/2 = 1

So, sequence with 3 adds and 1 remove.

Possible sequences:

- A, A, A, R: m=3

- A, A, R, A: m=3

- A, R, A, A: m=3

- R, A, A, A: invalid, as first move is R when there are no cubes.

So, only m=3 is achievable, and m=2 is not achievable, but according to the program, since a and r are integers and n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0, it outputs 'YES', which is incorrect.

This suggests that the program is flawed because it doesn't account for the ordering constraint.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Counterexample:**

n=4, m=2

According to the program, n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0, so it outputs 'YES'.

But in reality, m=2 is not achievable due to the ordering constraint, so the program is incorrect.

Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: }\mathbf{False}} \]
