Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix, swapping them, and concatenating them back together.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The problem states that we have an array, and we can perform the following operation any number of times: split the array into two parts—a prefix and a suffix—and swap these two parts. After performing this operation, the array becomes the concatenation of the suffix and the prefix. The goal is to check if, after performing this operation zero or more times, the array can be made non-decreasing.

Let me think about what this operation really does. Splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them is essentially rotating the array. For example, if we have an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and we choose prefix [1, 2] and suffix [3, 4, 5], swapping them gives us [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]. If we perform this operation again, splitting into [3, 4] and [5, 1, 2], swapping gives [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]. This seems similar to rotating the array to the left by a certain number of positions.

Wait, but rotation is usually defined as moving elements from the end to the beginning or vice versa. In this case, splitting into prefix and suffix and swapping seems like a generalization of rotation, where the split point can be anywhere.

So, the operation allows us to rotate the array in a generalized way, not just by one position but by any number of positions.

Now, the question is whether, by performing such rotations any number of times, we can make the array sorted in non-decreasing order.

I need to think about the properties of such operations and how they affect the array's order.

First, let's consider that rotation is a permutation of the array elements. Each rotation corresponds to a specific permutation of the array indices.

If we can perform rotations any number of times, we are essentially generating a group of permutations under composition.

In group theory, the set of all rotations of an array forms a cyclic group, which means that any rotation can be achieved by composing a basic rotation operation.

However, in this problem, the rotation is generalized to splitting into any prefix and suffix and swapping them, which might not correspond to a simple cyclic rotation.

Wait, let's see: if we split the array into prefix x and suffix y, and swap them to get y + x, this is equivalent to rotating the array by the length of x.

For example, if we have array [a, b, c, d, e] and split into x=[a, b] and y=[c, d, e], swapping gives [c, d, e, a, b], which is a rotation by 2 positions.

Similarly, splitting into x=[a] and y=[b, c, d, e], swapping gives [b, c, d, e, a], which is a rotation by 1 position.

So, it seems that any split and swap operation corresponds to a rotation by the length of the prefix.

Therefore, performing this operation multiple times would correspond to multiple rotations, which is still equivalent to a single rotation by the sum of the rotation amounts modulo the array length.

Wait, but rotations by different amounts may generate different permutations.

Actually, in group theory, the set of all rotations forms a cyclic group of order n, where n is the length of the array.

Therefore, any sequence of rotations can be reduced to a single rotation by some amount.

But in this problem, the operation allows splitting into any prefix and suffix and swapping them, which corresponds to rotating the array by the length of the prefix.

So, the question is: can we generate any permutation of the array by performing such rotations?

Well, in the cyclic group of rotations, not all permutations are achievable; only rotations are.

However, in this problem, since we can choose any prefix and suffix to swap, it might be possible to generate more permutations than just cyclic rotations.

Wait, but swapping a prefix of length k with the suffix is equivalent to rotating the array by k positions.

Therefore, the operations allowed are rotations by any number of positions, which is equivalent to generating the cyclic group of rotations.

Hence, the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order if and only if there exists a rotation of the array that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

So, the problem reduces to checking whether there exists a rotation of the array that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

This is a standard problem in array manipulation.

Therefore, the correct approach is to check all possible rotations of the array and see if any of them is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given that the array length is up to 50, and the number of test cases is up to 1000, this is computationally feasible.

Now, looking at the provided program, I need to verify if it correctly implements this logic.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

Func_2 seems to be the main function that reads input and calls func_1 for each test case.

Func_1 takes an array as input and is supposed to determine if it can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operations.

Looking at func_1:

def func_1(arr):

if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):

return 'Yes'

return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

This seems simplistic. It checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and if not, it returns 'No'.

Wait, but according to our earlier reasoning, we need to check all possible rotations of the array to see if any rotation results in a sorted array.

However, func_1 only checks if the array is already sorted and returns 'Yes' in that case, and 'No' otherwise.

This does not account for the possibility of sorting the array through rotations.

Therefore, this seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me look at the example provided in the problem description.

In the second test case:

5

7 9 2 2 3

According to the problem, by performing operations (rotations), we can achieve [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted.

However, the initial array [7,9,2,2,3] is not sorted, so func_1 would return 'No', which contradicts the expected output 'Yes'.

Hence, func_1 is incorrect.

So, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the task, I need to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description.

Given that func_1 does not check all possible rotations, it is incorrect.

Therefore, the Correctness should be False.

But let's see if there are any cases where func_1 might coincidentally give the correct answer.

For example, if the array is already sorted, func_1 correctly returns 'Yes'.

If the array cannot be sorted by any rotation, func_1 would correctly return 'No'.

However, if the array can be sorted by some rotation but is not sorted in its original form, func_1 would incorrectly return 'No'.

Hence, there are cases where func_1 fails, so the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**.

But wait, in the third test case:

3

1 2 3

This is already sorted, so func_1 would return 'Yes', which is correct.

In the second test case:

5

7 9 2 2 3

Which can be sorted by rotation, but func_1 would return 'No', which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the final answer should be Correctness: **False**.

However, the task requires me to follow the format strictly: Correctness: **True or False**.

Hence, I should write:

Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix, swapping them, and concatenating them back together.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Operation**: The operation described is equivalent to rotating the array. By splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them, we are essentially rotating the array.
2. **Goal**: We need to check if any rotation of the array results in a non-decreasing sorted array.
3. **Efficient Check**: Instead of generating all possible rotations explicitly, we can check if the array can be split into two parts such that the second part is appended to the first part to form a sorted array.

### Solution Code
```python
def can_be_sorted_by_rotation(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Find the number of places where the array is not in non-decreasing order
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > arr[(i + 1) % n]:
            count += 1
            index = i  # Record the index where the array is not in order
    # If there is at most one such place, it can be sorted by rotation
    if count <= 1:
        return 'Yes'
    # If there are more than one, check if rotating at the recorded index helps
    if count == 2:
        # Check if the array can be split and rotated to be sorted
        # Rotate the array by the index where the second violation occurs
        rotate_index = (index + 1) % n
        rotated_arr = arr[rotate_index:] + arr[:rotate_index]
        if all(rotated_arr[i] <= rotated_arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = can_be_sorted_by_rotation(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Counting Discrepancies**: We count the number of times the array elements are not in non-decreasing order by comparing each element to the next one (with the last element compared to the first to handle the circular nature).
2. **Single Discrepancy**: If there is at most one discrepancy, the array is already sorted or can be sorted by a single rotation.
3. **Two Discrepancies**: If there are exactly two discrepancies, we check if rotating the array at the point of the second discrepancy results in a sorted array.
4. **More Discrepancies**: If there are more than two discrepancies, it's impossible to sort the array with the given operations.

This approach ensures we efficiently determine whether the array can be sorted via rotations, without generating all possible rotations explicitly.
