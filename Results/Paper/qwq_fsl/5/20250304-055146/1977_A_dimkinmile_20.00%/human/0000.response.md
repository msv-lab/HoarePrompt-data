Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. I need to determine if the program meets the requirements for every possible input case. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I have to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

Let's start by understanding the problem description and the provided program.

### Problem Description

Nikita has some cubes and wants to build a tower using them. He can perform two types of moves:

1. Add exactly one cube to the top of the tower.
2. Remove exactly one cube from the top of the tower.

The task is to determine if, after a given number of moves `n`, it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower.

### Input

- The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), the number of test cases.
- Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

### Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, otherwise "No".

### Provided Program

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Analysis

First, I need to understand what the program is doing and whether it correctly solves the problem as described.

The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`. This function reads two integers `n` and `m` and checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If so, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

So, the logic implemented is: if the number of moves `n` is greater than or equal to the desired number of cubes `m`, then it's possible to achieve `m` cubes.

### Is This Correct?

I need to verify if this logic accurately reflects the possibilities described in the problem.

Let's think about the operations:

- Adding a cube: increases the tower by one cube.
- Removing a cube: decreases the tower by one cube, but only if there is at least one cube to remove.

We need to see if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after exactly `n` moves.

#### Key Points to Consider

1. **Maximum Possible Cubes**: The maximum number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves would be `n` (if all moves are additions).

2. **Minimum Possible Cubes**: The minimum number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves depends on the sequence of operations. For example:
   - If we add a cube and then remove it, the tower remains unchanged.
   - If we add `k` cubes and remove `k` cubes in any order, the tower can be back to 0 cubes.

3. **Parity Consideration**: Each add-remove pair brings the tower back to the previous state. So, the net effect of an even number of moves can be zero change, while an odd number of moves will depend on the last operation.

4. **Feasibility**: To have `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to ensure that `m` does not exceed `n` (since each add operation increases the tower by one), and that `m` is achievable given the sequence of operations.

### Counterexample

Let's consider a test case where `n = 2` and `m = 4`.

According to the program, since `n < m` (2 < 4), it would print "No". Is this correct?

Let's think about it:

- With 2 moves, the maximum number of cubes we can have is 2 (by adding a cube in each move).

- It's impossible to have 4 cubes with only 2 moves.

So, in this case, "No" is the correct answer.

Another test case: `n = 3`, `m = 3`.

Possible sequence: add, add, add. This results in 3 cubes. So, "Yes".

Another test case: `n = 1`, `m = 0`.

Possible sequence: add a cube and then remove it, but since n=1, we can only perform one move. So, either add one cube or remove one cube (but if the tower is empty, removal isn't possible). Hence, it's impossible to have 0 cubes after 1 move. So, "No".

Wait, according to the program:

- For `n=1`, `m=0`: since 1 >= 0, it would print "Yes", but as per our reasoning, it should be "No".

Ah, here's a counterexample where the program gives an incorrect answer.

So, in this case, the program would say "Yes", but actually, it's not possible.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the parity and the sequence of operations.

After analyzing, I realize that:

- The net effect of a sequence of add and remove operations can be thought of as the difference between the number of add operations and the number of remove operations.

- However, remove operations can only be performed if there is at least one cube in the tower.

- Therefore, the number of remove operations cannot exceed the current number of cubes in the tower.

This makes it a bit more complex to determine directly.

A better way is to consider that each remove operation must be preceded by at least one add operation.

So, to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of add operations should be `m + k`, and the number of remove operations should be `k`, where `k` is the number of remove operations performed.

Thus, `n = (m + k) + k = m + 2k`.

From this, `n - m` must be even, and `n >= m`.

So, the correct condition is:

- If `n >= m` and `(n - m)` is even, then "Yes"; else, "No".

### Conclusion

The provided program only checks if `n >= m`, which is incomplete. It fails in cases where `n >= m` but `(n - m)` is odd, as in the example `n=1`, `m=0`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
