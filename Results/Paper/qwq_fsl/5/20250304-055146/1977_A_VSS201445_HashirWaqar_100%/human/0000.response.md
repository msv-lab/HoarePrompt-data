Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

Let's start by understanding the problem description and the provided program.

### Problem Description

Nikita has some cubes and wants to build a tower using them. He can perform two types of moves:

1. **Add** one cube to the top of the tower.
2. **Remove** one cube from the top of the tower.

The goal is to determine if, after a given number of moves `n`, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

### Input

- The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), the number of test cases.
- Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

### Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, otherwise "No".

### Example

**Input:**

```

3

3 3

2 4

5 3

```

**Output:**

```

Yes

No

Yes

```

### Provided Program

```python

def func():

    for _ in range(int(input())):

        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())

        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:

            print('YES')

        else:

            print('NO')

```

### Analysis

First, I need to understand the logic behind the program and see if it correctly addresses the problem.

#### Key Points from the Problem

1. **Initial State:** The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Moves:**
   - Add 1 cube.
   - Remove 1 cube.
3. **Objective:** After `n` moves, have exactly `m` cubes in the tower.

#### Insights

- Each move changes the number of cubes in the tower by exactly 1 (either +1 or -1).
- We need to find a sequence of `n` moves resulting in exactly `m` cubes.

#### Constraints

- `n` and `m` are both integers between 1 and 100.
- `t` test cases, each with its own `n` and `m`.

#### Approach in the Provided Program

The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads `n` and `m`. It checks two conditions:

1. `n >= m`
2. `(n - m) % 2 == 0`

If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

#### Understanding the Conditions

1. **`n >= m`**

   - This ensures that the number of moves is at least equal to the number of cubes we want in the tower. If `n < m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because even if we only add cubes, we can't exceed `n` cubes.

2. **`(n - m) % 2 == 0`**

   - This condition checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even.

#### Reasoning

- Each add operation increases the cube count by 1.
- Each remove operation decreases the cube count by 1.

- Let’s denote:
  - `a` = number of add operations
  - `r` = number of remove operations

- We have:
  - `a + r = n` (total moves)
  - `m = a - r` (net cubes added)

- We can solve these equations:
  - From `a + r = n`, we get `a = n - r`.
  - Substituting in `m = a - r`: `m = (n - r) - r = n - 2r`.
  - Therefore: `m = n - 2r`.
  - Rearranged: `2r = n - m`.
  - Thus: `r = (n - m)/2`.

- For `r` to be an integer (since you can't have a fraction of a move), `(n - m)` must be even.

- Also, `r` must be non-negative: `(n - m)/2 >= 0` ⇒ `n >= m`.

Hence, the conditions in the program make sense.

### Verification

I need to verify if this logic covers all possible scenarios correctly.

#### Test Cases from the Example

1. **n=3, m=3**

   - `n >= m` ⇒ 3 >= 3 → True
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ⇒ (3 - 3) % 2 == 0 → 0 % 2 == 0 → True
   - Output: "YES"

2. **n=2, m=4**

   - `n >= m` ⇒ 2 >= 4 → False
   - Output: "NO"

3. **n=5, m=3**

   - `n >= m` ⇒ 5 >= 3 → True
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ⇒ (5 - 3) % 2 == 0 → 2 % 2 == 0 → True
   - Output: "YES"

These match the expected output.

#### Additional Test Cases

To ensure correctness, let's consider some additional test cases.

1. **n=1, m=1**

   - `n >= m` ⇒ 1 >= 1 → True
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ⇒ (1 - 1) % 2 == 0 → 0 % 2 == 0 → True
   - Output: "YES"

   - **Sequence:** Add (1 cube)

2. **n=1, m=0**

   - `n >= m` ⇒ 1 >= 0 → True
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ⇒ (1 - 0) % 2 == 0 → 1 % 2 == 0 → False
   - Output: "NO"

   - **Sequence:** Remove (but starting with 0 cubes, remove is invalid)

3. **n=2, m=0**

   - `n >= m` ⇒ 2 >= 0 → True
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ⇒ (2 - 0) % 2 == 0 → 2 % 2 == 0 → True
   - Output: "YES"

   - **Sequence:** Add, Remove (or Remove, Add but Remove on 0 is invalid)

   - **Issue:** Starting with 0 cubes, a remove operation isn't possible.

   - **Conclusion:** The program allows `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, but in this case, removing from 0 is invalid.

Wait a minute, this seems like a potential flaw in the program's logic.

### Potential Flaw

In the third test case above (`n=2, m=0`), according to the program's logic:

- `n >= m` ⇒ 2 >= 0 → True
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ⇒ (2 - 0) % 2 == 0 → 2 % 2 == 0 → True
- Output: "YES"

However, is it actually possible to end up with 0 cubes after 2 moves?

Let's consider the sequences:

1. **Add, Remove:**

   - Start with 0
   - Add: 1
   - Remove: 0

   - Final cubes: 0

   - Valid sequence.

2. **Remove, Add:**

   - Start with 0
   - Remove: Invalid (can't remove from 0)

   - This sequence is invalid.

So, only one valid sequence exists: Add, Remove.

Hence, it is possible to have 0 cubes after 2 moves.

Another example:

**n=4, m=0**

Possible sequence:

- Add, Add, Remove, Remove

- Final cubes: 0

or

- Add, Remove, Add, Remove

- Final cubes: 0

Both sequences are valid.

Wait, but what if n=1, m=0?

- Sequence: Remove (invalid, starting from 0)

Hence, output should be "NO"

But according to the program:

- `n >= m` ⇒ 1 >= 0 → True
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ⇒ (1 - 0) % 2 == 0 → 1 % 2 == 0 → False
- Output: "NO"

Which is correct.

Wait, but earlier for n=2, m=0, the program outputs "YES", which seems correct based on the sequence Add, Remove.

But is there a case where the program says "YES" but it's actually "NO"?

Let's think about n=3, m=0.

- `n >= m` ⇒ 3 >= 0 → True
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ⇒ (3 - 0) % 2 == 0 → 3 % 2 == 0 → False
- Output: "NO"

Possible sequences:

- Add, Add, Remove: 2 -1 =1 (not 0)

- Add, Remove, Add: 1,0,1 (not 0)

- Add, Remove, Remove: 1,0,-1 (invalid, can't have negative cubes)

- Remove, Add, Add: Invalid (can't remove from 0)

Hence, it's impossible to have 0 cubes after 3 moves. The program correctly outputs "NO".

Another case: n=4, m=1

- `n >= m` ⇒ 4 >= 1 → True
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ⇒ (4 - 1) % 2 == 0 → 3 % 2 == 0 → False
- Output: "NO"

Possible sequences:

- Add, Add, Add, Remove: 3-1=2

- Add, Add, Remove, Add: 2-1+1=2

- Add, Remove, Add, Add: 1,0,1,2

- Add, Remove, Remove, Add: 1,0,-1 invalid

- Remove, Add, Add, Add: Invalid

Hence, it's impossible to have 1 cube after 4 moves. The program correctly outputs "NO".

Wait, but according to the condition, `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is False, so "NO", which matches.

Seems correct.

Is there any case where the program says "YES" but it's actually "NO"?

Let's think about n=5, m=1.

- `n >= m` ⇒ 5 >= 1 → True
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ⇒ (5 - 1) % 2 == 0 → 4 % 2 == 0 → True
- Output: "YES"

Possible sequences:

- Add, Add, Add, Add, Remove: 4-1=3

- Add, Add, Add, Remove, Add: 3-1+1=3

- Add, Add, Remove, Add, Add: 2-1+1+1=3

- Add, Remove, Add, Add, Add: 1,0,1,2,3

- Add, Add, Add, Remove, Remove: 3-1-1=1

Wait, this sequence: Add, Add, Add, Remove, Remove: 1,2,3,2,1

Final cubes: 1

This is a valid sequence.

Hence, it's possible.

Seems correct.

Another case: n=3, m=2

- `n >= m` ⇒ 3 >= 2 → True
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ⇒ (3 - 2) % 2 == 0 → 1 % 2 == 0 → False
- Output: "NO"

Possible sequences:

- Add, Add, Add: 3

- Add, Add, Remove: 2

- Add, Remove, Add: 1,0,1

- Add, Remove, Remove: 1,0,-1 invalid

- Remove, Add, Add: Invalid

Hence, the only sequence that results in 2 cubes is Add, Add, Remove.

But final cubes are 2, which matches m=2.

But according to the program, since `(n - m) % 2 != 0`, it outputs "NO", which is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in this sequence, we have Add, Add, Remove: 2 cubes.

Is this a valid sequence?

Yes, it is valid.

Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the program's logic, for n=3, m=2:

- n >= m → True

- (n - m) % 2 == 0 → 1 % 2 == 0 → False

- Output: "NO"

But actually, it's possible to have m=2 with n=3 moves.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because there exists at least one case where it says "NO" but it should be "YES".

**Counterexample:**

- n=3, m=2

- Program outputs "NO" but it's possible with the sequence Add, Add, Remove.

Hence, the program does not correctly handle all cases.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation

The program's logic is incomplete because it doesn't account for the fact that remove operations can only be performed when there is at least one cube in the tower. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n >= m` is necessary but not sufficient to ensure that the sequence of operations is valid.

In the counterexample, n=3, m=2:

- According to the program, since (3 - 2) % 2 != 0, it outputs "NO".

- However, a valid sequence exists: Add, Add, Remove, resulting in 2 cubes.

Therefore, the program incorrectly rejects this case.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that at no point does the number of cubes become negative during the sequence of operations. The current logic doesn't account for the ordering of operations, which is crucial because remove operations cannot be performed when there are no cubes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
