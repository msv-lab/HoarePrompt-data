Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program is completely correct.

Let's start by understanding the problem and the program.

**Problem Description:**

Alice and Bob are playing a game with their wallets containing a and b coins respectively. They take turns, with Alice starting first. In each turn, the player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep the current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. Both play optimally.

**Program:**

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

So, the program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the input line, splits it into a and b, and based on whether their sum is even or odd, it decides who wins.

Wait a minute, this seems too straightforward. The problem involves a game with strategic choices, and the program just checks if the sum of a and b is even or odd to determine the winner. Is this logically correct?

I need to verify if this logic aligns with the game's rules and the optimal strategies of both players.

First, let's consider the base cases:

1. **Both a and b are 1:**

   - Alice has 1 coin, Bob has 1 coin.

   - Alice's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. Now, Alice has 1 coin, Bob has 1 coin.

     - Remove 1 coin. Now, Alice has 0 coins, Bob has 1 coin.

   - Bob's move:

     - Cannot swap because swapping would still leave him with 1 coin.

     - Remove 1 coin. Now, Alice has 0 coins, Bob has 0 coins.

   - Alice's move:

     - Cannot remove a coin because her wallet is empty.

   - So, Alice cannot make a move, hence Bob wins.

   According to the program:

   - a + b = 1 + 1 = 2, which is even, so Bob wins. Correct.

2. **a = 1, b = 4:**

   - Alice's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=4, b=1.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=3, b=1.

   - Bob's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=1, b=3.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=3.

   - Alice's move:

     - Cannot swap because swapping would leave her with 3 coins, but she has to remove 1 coin anyway.

     - Remove 1 coin from b=3 to b=2.

   - Bob's move:

     - Swap wallets. a=2, b=0.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=0.

   - Alice's move:

     - Swap wallets. a=0, b=1.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=0.

   - Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

   According to the program:

   - a + b = 1 + 4 = 5, which is odd, so Alice wins. Correct.

3. **a = 5, b = 3:**

   - Alice's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=3, b=5.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=2, b=5.

   - Bob's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=5, b=2.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=4, b=2.

   - Alice's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=2, b=4.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=4.

   - Bob's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=4, b=1.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=3, b=1.

   - Alice's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=1, b=3.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=3.

   - Bob's move:

     - Cannot swap because swapping would leave him with 3 coins.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=2.

   - Alice's move:

     - Swap wallets. a=2, b=0.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=0.

   - Bob's move:

     - Swap wallets. a=0, b=1.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=0.

   - Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins.

   According to the program:

   - a + b = 5 + 3 = 8, which is even, so Bob wins. Correct.

4. **a = 4, b = 5:**

   - Alice's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=5, b=4.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=4, b=4.

   - Bob's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=4, b=4.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=3, b=4.

   - Alice's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=4, b=3.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=3, b=3.

   - Bob's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=3, b=3.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=2, b=3.

   - Alice's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=3, b=2.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=2, b=2.

   - Bob's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=2, b=2.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=2.

   - Alice's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=2, b=1.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=1.

   - Bob's move:

     - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=1, b=1.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=1.

   - Alice's move:

     - Swap wallets. a=1, b=0.

     - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=0.

   - Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

   According to the program:

   - a + b = 4 + 5 = 9, which is odd, so Alice wins. Correct.

5. **a = 11, b = 9:**

   - According to the program: 11 + 9 = 20, which is even, so Bob wins.

   - Let's think about it: It's a bit complex to simulate all moves, but based on the pattern, it seems correct.

6. **a = 83, b = 91:**

   - 83 + 91 = 174, which is even, so Bob wins.

7. **a = 1032, b = 9307:**

   - 1032 + 9307 = 10339, which is odd, so Alice wins.

8. **a = 839204, b = 7281:**

   - 839204 + 7281 = 846485, which is odd, so Alice wins.

9. **a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000:**

   - 1000000000 + 1000000000 = 2000000000, which is even, so Bob wins.

10. **a = 53110, b = 2024:**

    - 53110 + 2024 = 55134, which is even, so Bob wins.

All these match the expected outputs provided in the example.

But is this just a coincidence, or is there a underlying pattern that makes the sum's parity determine the winner?

Let me try to find a general strategy or a mathematical pattern.

**Observations:**

- The game continues until one player cannot make a move, which happens when both wallets are empty or the player's current wallet has 0 coins.

- Players can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet before removing a coin.

- Both play optimally, meaning they will choose the action that leads to their victory.

**Possible Strategy:**

- If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

But is this always true? Let's think about it differently.

Suppose we consider the total number of moves possible in the game. Each move reduces the total number of coins by one because one coin is removed in each move.

The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when their current wallet has 0 coins and they cannot swap to a non-empty wallet.

In other words, the game ends when both wallets are empty or when it's a player's turn and their current wallet is empty.

Given that Alice starts first, the player who makes the last move wins because they will leave the other player with no moves.

The total number of moves is equal to the total number of coins because each move removes one coin.

So, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice makes the last move (since she starts first), and if it's even, Bob makes the last move.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic. Let's verify with the earlier examples.

- In the first example, a=1, b=1: total coins=2 (even), Bob wins. Correct.

- Second example, a=1, b=4: total coins=5 (odd), Alice wins. Correct.

- Third example, a=5, b=3: total coins=8 (even), Bob wins. Correct.

- Fourth example, a=4, b=5: total coins=9 (odd), Alice wins. Correct.

- Fifth example, a=11, b=9: total coins=20 (even), Bob wins. Correct.

- And so on.

All these align with the program's logic.

But is there any scenario where this logic fails?

Let me try to think of a case where the total number of coins is even, but Alice can force a win, or vice versa.

Consider a=2, b=2:

- Total coins=4 (even), so according to the program, Bob wins.

- Game play:

  - Alice's move:

    - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=2, b=2.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=2.

  - Bob's move:

    - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=2, b=1.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=1.

  - Alice's move:

    - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=1, b=1.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=1.

  - Bob's move:

    - Swap wallets. a=1, b=0.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=0.

  - Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins.

Correct, aligns with the program.

Another case: a=3, b=1:

- Total coins=4 (even), Bob wins.

- Game play:

  - Alice's move:

    - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=1, b=3.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=3.

  - Bob's move:

    - Cannot swap because swapping would leave him with 3 coins.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=2.

  - Alice's move:

    - Swap wallets. a=2, b=0.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=0.

  - Bob's move:

    - Swap wallets. a=0, b=1.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=0.

  - Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins.

Again, correct.

Wait, but in this case, Alice could have chosen not to swap initially:

- Alice's move:

  - Option 2: Do not swap. a=3, b=1.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=2, b=1.

- Bob's move:

  - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=1, b=2.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=2.

- Alice's move:

  - Swap wallets. a=2, b=0.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=0.

- Bob's move:

  - Swap wallets. a=0, b=1.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=0.

- Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins.

Still, Bob wins.

Another case: a=2, b=1:

- Total coins=3 (odd), Alice wins.

- Game play:

  - Alice's move:

    - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=1, b=2.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=2.

  - Bob's move:

    - Swap wallets. a=2, b=0.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=0.

  - Alice's move:

    - Swap wallets. a=0, b=1.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=0.

  - Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

Correct.

Alternatively, if Alice chooses not to swap:

- Alice's move:

  - Do not swap. a=2, b=1.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=1.

- Bob's move:

  - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=1, b=1.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=1.

- Alice's move:

  - Swap wallets. a=1, b=0.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=0.

- Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

Still, Alice wins.

It seems consistent.

Wait, but in the problem description, it says that both players play optimally. So, they will choose the action that leads to their victory.

Given that, the program's logic seems to hold.

Is there any case where the sum is even, but Alice can force a win, or sum is odd, but Bob can force a win?

Let me think about larger numbers.

Suppose a=1000000000, b=1000000000: sum=2000000000 (even), Bob wins. As per the program and the example output.

Another case: a=1, b=1000000000: sum=1000000001 (odd), Alice wins.

Seems correct.

Wait, but maybe there are cases where the ability to swap changes the parity effect.

Let me consider a=0, b=1: but the problem states a and b are at least 1, so a=0 is invalid.

Wait, a and b are at least 1.

What if a=1, b=2:

- Sum=3 (odd), Alice wins.

- Game play:

  - Alice's move:

    - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=2, b=1.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=1.

  - Bob's move:

    - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=1, b=1.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=1.

  - Alice's move:

    - Swap wallets. a=1, b=0.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=0.

  - Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

Alternatively, if Alice chooses not to swap:

- Alice's move:

  - Do not swap. a=1, b=2.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=2.

- Bob's move:

  - Cannot swap because swapping would leave him with 2 coins.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=1.

- Alice's move:

  - Swap wallets. a=1, b=0.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=0.

- Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

Again, Alice wins.

Another case: a=3, b=2:

- Sum=5 (odd), Alice wins.

- Game play:

  - Alice's move:

    - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=2, b=3.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=3.

  - Bob's move:

    - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=3, b=1.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=2, b=1.

  - Alice's move:

    - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=1, b=2.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=2.

  - Bob's move:

    - Swap wallets. a=2, b=0.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=0.

  - Alice's move:

    - Swap wallets. a=0, b=1.

    - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=0.

  - Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

Alternatively, if Alice chooses not to swap initially:

- Alice's move:

  - Do not swap. a=3, b=2.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=2, b=2.

- Bob's move:

  - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=2, b=2.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=2.

- Alice's move:

  - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=2, b=1.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=1, b=1.

- Bob's move:

  - Option 1: Swap wallets. a=1, b=1.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=1.

- Alice's move:

  - Swap wallets. a=1, b=0.

  - Remove 1 coin. a=0, b=0.

- Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

Again, Alice wins.

It seems consistent.

Wait, but let's think about a case where a and b are different by a large margin.

Say a=1, b=1000000000: sum=1000000001 (odd), Alice wins.

- Alice can swap to have a large number of coins, and then proceed to force Bob into a losing position.

Given the optimal play, it seems Alice can always force a win when the sum is odd.

Similarly, when the sum is even, Bob can force a win.

Therefore, the program's logic seems to hold.

Is there any edge case where this logic fails?

Let me consider a=1, b=1: sum=2 (even), Bob wins, as per the example.

Another case: a=2, b=2: sum=4 (even), Bob wins, as per earlier simulation.

a=3, b=1: sum=4 (even), Bob wins.

a=3, b=3: sum=6 (even), Bob wins.

a=4, b=5: sum=9 (odd), Alice wins.

a=5, b=5: sum=10 (even), Bob wins.

a=6, b=4: sum=10 (even), Bob wins.

a=7, b=4: sum=11 (odd), Alice wins.

Seems consistent.

Is there a case where the sum is even, but Alice can force a win?

I can't find one. It seems that when the sum is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves in some way to ensure he makes the last move.

Similarly, when the sum is odd, Alice can make a move that leaves an even sum for Bob, forcing him into a losing position.

Therefore, the program's logic seems to be correct.

I cannot find any counterexample where the sum's parity does not determine the winner correctly.

Hence, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \textbf{True}} \]
