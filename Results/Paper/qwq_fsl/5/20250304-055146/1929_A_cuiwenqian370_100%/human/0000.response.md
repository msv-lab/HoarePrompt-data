Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to calculate the "beauty" of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. The goal is to maximize the beauty by rearranging the array. So, I need to find the arrangement of the array that gives the highest possible sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n.

Let me think about what this sum represents. It's the sum of differences between consecutive elements. So, if the array is sorted in ascending order, the differences would be minimal, and if it's sorted in descending order, the differences would be larger.

Wait, actually, if it's sorted in descending order, (a_i - a_{i-1}) would be negative, which might not maximize the sum. Hmm, maybe I need to arrange the array in a specific way to maximize this sum.

Let me consider an example. Suppose the array is [1, 2, 3]. If I arrange it as [1, 2, 3], the sum is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. If I arrange it as [1, 3, 2], the sum is (3-1) + (2-3) = 2 -1 = 1. If I arrange it as [2, 1, 3], the sum is (1-2) + (3-1) = -1 + 2 = 1. So, the maximum sum is 2, which is achieved by sorting in ascending order.

Wait, but in the first example in the problem, they have [2,1,3], and they rearrange it to [1,2,3], giving a sum of 2. So, arranging in ascending order gives the maximum sum.

But in the second example, all elements are the same: [69,69,69]. So, no matter how you arrange them, the sum will be zero, which is the maximum possible.

In the third example, [100,54,80,43,90], let's see:

If arranged in ascending order: [43,54,80,90,100], sum is (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57.

If arranged in descending order: [100,90,80,54,43], sum is (90-100) + (80-90) + (54-80) + (43-54) = -10 -10 -26 -11 = -57.

So, arranging in ascending order gives the maximum sum.

Wait, but in the first example, arranging in ascending order gives the maximum sum, and in the second example, where all elements are equal, any arrangement gives sum zero, which is maximum.

So, it seems that arranging the array in ascending order maximizes the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}).

Wait, but in the first example, arranging in ascending order gives sum 2, which is higher than other arrangements.

Wait, but in the third example, arranging in ascending order gives sum 57, which is higher than any other arrangement.

Wait, but according to the problem, beauty is sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n.

So, sum_{i=2 to n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) = a_n - a_1.

Because it's a telescoping sum: a2 - a1 + a3 - a2 + ... + an - a_{n-1} = an - a1.

So, the beauty is simply an - a1, where a1 and an are the first and last elements in the arranged array.

So, to maximize an - a1, we need to maximize an and minimize a1.

So, to maximize an - a1, we should arrange the array such that an is maximum and a1 is minimum.

So, arrange the array with the smallest element first and the largest element last.

So, sort the array in ascending order.

Wait, but in the first example, [1,2,3], beauty is 3 - 1 = 2.

In the second example, all elements equal, so an - a1 = 0.

In the third example, [43,54,80,90,100], beauty is 100 - 43 = 57.

In the fourth example, [3,4,3,3], beauty is 4 - 3 = 1.

In the fifth example, [1,2], beauty is 2 - 1 = 1.

So, in all these cases, sorting in ascending order gives the maximum beauty.

So, the program should sort the array in ascending order and compute an - a1.

Now, looking at the provided program:

It defines func_1, which sorts the array and then computes the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, we don't need absolute differences; we just need to compute an - a1 after sorting.

Wait, in the first example, sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) is 2, which is an - a1 = 3 -1 =2.

In the third example, an - a1 = 100 -43=57.

So, why is the program computing the sum of absolute differences?

Wait, in func_1, it sorts the array and then sums up abs(a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 1 to n-1.

But according to the problem, it's sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), not absolute differences.

Wait, but in the first example, sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) is 2, which is an - a1.

But in the program, it's using abs(a_i - a_{i-1}), which is not necessary.

Wait, maybe the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the first example, sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) is 2, which is an - a1.

If we sort the array in ascending order, a_i - a_{i-1} is positive for each i, so sum is an - a1.

But if we sort in ascending order, sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) is indeed an - a1.

But in the program, it's using abs(a_i - a_{i-1}), which is redundant because in ascending order, a_i - a_{i-1} is non-negative.

So, abs(a_i - a_{i-1}) = a_i - a_{i-1} in this case.

So, perhaps the program is correct, but it's doing unnecessary computations.

Wait, but in the second example, all elements are equal, so sum is zero, which is correct.

In the third example, sum is 57, which matches an - a1.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for these examples.

But is it always correct?

Wait, suppose the array is [1,3,2].

If sorted in ascending order: [1,2,3], sum is (2-1) + (3-2) =1 +1=2, which is an - a1=3-1=2.

If sorted in descending order: [3,2,1], sum is (2-3) + (1-2) =-1 + -1=-2, which is not maximum.

So, arranging in ascending order gives the maximum sum.

So, the program sorts the array and computes the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), which is correct.

But why is it using abs(a_i - a_{i-1}) in func_1?

Wait, in func_1, it's using abs(a_i - a_{i-1}), but in the examples, since the array is sorted in ascending order, a_i - a_{i-1} is non-negative, so abs is redundant.

But, if there is any case where a_i - a_{i-1} is negative, abs would make it positive, which is not what we want.

Wait, but since we're sorting the array in ascending order, a_i >= a_{i-1}, so a_i - a_{i-1} >=0, so abs is not necessary but doesn't harm.

So, the program is correct, but it's doing unnecessary abs operations.

Is there any case where this program would give incorrect results?

Suppose the array has duplicates.

For example, [1,1,1], sum should be 0, which is correct.

Another example: [1,2,2], sum is (2-1) + (2-2) =1 +0=1, which is an - a1=2-1=1.

So, seems correct.

Another case: [5,3,4], sorted [3,4,5], sum=(4-3)+(5-4)=1+1=2, which is an - a1=5-3=2.

Correct.

Wait, but in func_1, it's using abs(a_i - a_{i-1}), which in this case is same as a_i - a_{i-1} since sorted in ascending order.

So, program seems correct.

But, what if we don't sort the array?

Wait, but in func_1, it sorts the array before computing the sum.

So, it's sorting in ascending order, which is correct.

Hence, the program is correct.

So, Correctness: **True**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the "beauty" of an array, where beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array. Specifically, beauty is calculated as \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to maximize the sum \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).
   - This sum simplifies to \(a_n - a_1\), where \(a_n\) is the last element and \(a_1\) is the first element in the arranged array.

2. **Optimal Arrangement**:
   - To maximize \(a_n - a_1\), we should arrange the array such that \(a_n\) is as large as possible and \(a_1\) is as small as possible.
   - Therefore, sorting the array in ascending order achieves this, making \(a_1\) the smallest element and \(a_n\) the largest element.

3. **Implementation**:
   - For each test case, sort the array in ascending order.
   - Calculate the beauty as the difference between the last and the first elements of the sorted array.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()
```

### Explanation

- **func_1**:
  - Sorts the array in ascending order.
  - Computes the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements, which, due to the sorting, is equivalent to summing positive differences.
  - This sum simplifies to the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array.

- **func_2**:
  - Reads input data from standard input.
  - Processes each test case by extracting the array length and elements.
  - Uses `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty for each test case.
  - Prints the result for each test case.

This approach ensures that we achieve the maximum possible beauty for each test case efficiently and correctly.
