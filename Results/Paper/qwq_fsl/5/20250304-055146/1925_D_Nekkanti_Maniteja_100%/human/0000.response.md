Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. If the program meets all the requirements correctly for every potential case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all possible scenarios to ensure the program's correctness.

Let's start by understanding the problem description and the provided program.

### Problem Description

There are `n` children in a class, and `m` pairs among them are friends, each with a friendship value `f_i`. The teacher goes on `k` excursions, choosing a pair of children randomly, equiprobably, and independently each time. If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. Pairs that are not friends have a friendship value of 0, which never changes.

We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). The answer should be expressed as a fraction `p/q` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers, and we need to compute `p * q^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7)`.

### Provided Program

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

### Analysis

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem fully.

- There are `n` children, and `m` pairs of friends, each with a friendship value `f_i`.
- The teacher chooses `k` pairs randomly for excursions.
- If a chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
- We need the expected sum of friendship values at the time of choosing each pair over `k` excursions.

Given that pairs are chosen independently and randomly, I need to model how the friendship values change over time and compute the expected sum.

### Understanding the Program

Let's look at the provided program step by step.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Read `m` lines, each containing `u`, `v`, and `f`, representing a friendship pair and their value.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`: This calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs (`n*(n-1)/2`).

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - Initialize `s = 0` and `a = 0`.
   - Sum up all friendship values `a += f` for all `m` pairs.
   - For each excursion `i` from 0 to `k-1`:
     - `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`

4. **Output:**
   - Print `s % M` for each test case.

### Potential Issues

I need to verify if this program correctly computes the expected sum of friendship values.

1. **Modular Inverse:**
   - `c` is the modular inverse of the total number of pairs, which seems correct for calculating probabilities.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum `s` is being updated in each iteration of `k` with `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - I need to understand what this expression represents.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value for each excursion should consider the current friendship values.
   - Since friendship values increase by 1 for each time a friend pair is chosen, the expected value should account for the increases over time.

### Detailed Examination

Let's consider the expected value for each excursion.

- For each excursion, the pair is chosen randomly and independently.
- If the chosen pair is a friend pair, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

To compute the expected sum, we need to consider the expected contribution of each friend pair over all excursions.

Let's denote:

- Let `p = m / (n choose 2)` be the probability of choosing a friend pair in any excursion.
- Each friend pair has an initial value `f_i`, and this value increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen.

However, since pairs are chosen independently, tracking the exact expected sum becomes complex due to the dependencies introduced by the increasing friendship values.

### Simplifying the Problem

Perhaps there's a smarter way to compute the expected sum.

- Let’s consider that for each friend pair, the expected number of times it is chosen in `k` excursions is `k * (1 / m)` if we consider only friend pairs, but that might not be directly applicable.

Wait, actually, the total number of possible pairs is `n choose 2`, and `m` of them are friend pairs.

So, the probability of choosing a friend pair in any excursion is `m / (n choose 2)`.

Let’s denote:

- Total possible pairs: `total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2`
- Probability of choosing a friend pair: `p = m / total_pairs`
- Probability of choosing a non-friend pair: `1 - p`

However, the friendship values only increase for friend pairs, and only when they are chosen.

### Expected Value Calculation

Let’s think about the expected friendship value for each chosen pair over `k` excursions.

For each excursion, the expected friendship value is:

- If a friend pair is chosen, its current friendship value is `f_i + number of times it has been chosen before`.
- If a non-friend pair is chosen, its friendship value is 0.

Since the choices are independent, the expected sum is the sum of expected values over each excursion.

Let’s denote `E` as the expected sum over `k` excursions.

Then,

`E = sum over i=1 to k of E[value chosen in excursion i]`

Now, for each excursion, the expected value is:

`E_i = sum over all friend pairs of [probability of choosing pair j in excursion i] * [current value of pair j at excursion i]`

But since choices are independent, the current value of pair j at excursion i depends on how many times it has been chosen in previous excursions.

This seems complicated due to the dependencies.

### Alternative Approach

Maybe we can model the expected increase in friendship values over the excursions.

Let’s consider that for each friend pair, each time it is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

So, if a friend pair is chosen `x` times, its friendship value will be `f_i + x`.

But since the choices are independent, the number of times a specific friend pair is chosen follows a binomial distribution with parameters `k` and `p = 1 / total_pairs`.

Wait, more accurately, the probability of choosing a specific friend pair in one excursion is `1 / total_pairs`.

But since there are `m` friend pairs, the probability of choosing any friend pair is `m / total_pairs`.

I need to think differently.

### Linearity of Expectation

Perhaps using linearity of expectation can simplify the problem.

Let’s consider that the total sum `S` is the sum of the friendship values at the time of choosing over all `k` excursions.

We can think of `S` as the sum over `i=1 to k` of `value chosen in excursion i`.

By linearity of expectation,

`E[S] = sum over i=1 to k of E[value chosen in excursion i]`

Now, for each excursion, the expected value is:

`E[value chosen in excursion i] = sum over all friend pairs of [probability of choosing pair j in excursion i] * [expected value of pair j at the time of choosing]`

Given that the choices are independent, the expected value of pair j at the time of choosing in excursion i is:

`f_j + number of times pair j has been chosen in previous excursions`

But again, this seems recursive and complicated.

### Simplified Model

Maybe I can model the expected increase in friendship values.

Let’s denote `X_j` as the number of times friend pair j is chosen in `k` excursions.

Then, `X_j` follows a binomial distribution with parameters `k` and `p_j = 1 / total_pairs`.

The friendship value of pair j at any choosing time is `f_j + X_j`.

Wait, no. Each time pair j is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent choices.

So, if pair j is chosen `x_j` times, its friendship value at the time of each choice is `f_j + number of times it has been chosen so far`.

This is getting too involved.

### Looking Back at the Provided Program

Let’s see what the provided program is doing.

It calculates `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`, which is the modular inverse of the total number of pairs.

Then, it sums over `k` excursions: `s += c * i * c * m + c * a`, where `a` is the sum of all initial friendship values.

This seems off.

Wait, perhaps the author is trying to compute the expected sum using some formula, but it's not clear what formula they are using.

Let me try to compute the expected value step by step.

### Correct Approach

Let’s consider the expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum.

For a specific friend pair `j` with initial value `f_j`, each time it is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent choices.

So, if it is chosen `x_j` times at times `t1, t2, ..., tx_j`, then its contribution to the total sum is `f_j` at each of its choices plus an additional `1` for each subsequent choice.

Wait, more carefully:

- Suppose a friend pair is chosen at excursions `t1, t2, ..., tx_j`.
- At each choice `t`, its friendship value at that time is `f_j + (number of times it has been chosen before t)`.

This seems complicated to model directly.

### Another Angle

Maybe think in terms of the number of times each friend pair is chosen.

Let’s denote `X_j` as the number of times friend pair `j` is chosen in `k` excursions.

Then, `X_j` follows a binomial distribution with parameters `k` and `p_j = 1 / total_pairs`.

The total sum `S` is the sum over all excursions of the friendship value at the time of choosing.

For friend pair `j`, each time it is chosen, its friendship value is `f_j + number of times it has been chosen so far - 1`.

Wait, more precisely:

- Let’s say a friend pair `j` is chosen `x_j` times.
- The first time it is chosen, its value is `f_j`.
- The second time, it's `f_j + 1`, and so on.
- So, the total contribution of pair `j` is `f_j * x_j + sum from l=1 to x_j-1 of l`.

Wait, no.

Actually, if a pair is chosen `x_j` times, its contributions are `f_j`, `f_j +1`, `f_j +2`, ..., up to `f_j + (x_j -1)`.

So, the total contribution is `x_j * f_j + sum from l=0 to x_j-1 of l = x_j * f_j + (x_j * (x_j -1)) / 2`.

Therefore, for each friend pair `j`, its expected contribution is `E[x_j * f_j + (x_j * (x_j -1)) / 2]`.

Similarly, for non-friend pairs, their contribution is always 0.

So, the total expected sum `E[S]` is the sum over all friend pairs of `E[x_j * f_j + (x_j * (x_j -1)) / 2]`.

Now, since `x_j` is binomially distributed with parameters `k` and `p_j = 1 / total_pairs`, we can compute `E[x_j]` and `E[x_j^2]`.

Given that, we can compute the expected sum.

### Computing Expectations

First, `p_j = m / total_pairs`, since there are `m` friend pairs out of `total_pairs`.

Wait, no. Each friend pair has `p_j = 1 / total_pairs`.

Wait, actually, the probability of choosing a specific friend pair in one excursion is `1 / total_pairs`.

Hence, `x_j ~ Binomial(k, 1 / total_pairs)`.

Now,

`E[x_j] = k / total_pairs`

`E[x_j^2] = Var(x_j) + (E[x_j])^2 = k * (1 / total_pairs) * (1 - 1 / total_pairs) + (k / total_pairs)^2`

But since `k` can be up to `2e5` and `total_pairs` can be up to `1e5`, `1 / total_pairs` can be very small, but we need to handle it carefully.

Now, the expected contribution of pair `j` is:

`E[x_j * f_j + (x_j * (x_j -1)) / 2] = f_j * E[x_j] + (E[x_j^2] - E[x_j]) / 2`

Substituting the expressions for `E[x_j]` and `E[x_j^2]`:

`f_j * (k / total_pairs) + (k * (1 / total_pairs) * (1 - 1 / total_pairs) + (k / total_pairs)^2 - k / total_pairs) / 2`

This seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.

### Simplifying the Expression

Let’s consider the total expected sum over all excursions.

Given that each excursion chooses a pair uniformly at random, independently of others, and that friend pairs have increasing friendship values upon being chosen.

I need to find a way to compute the expected sum efficiently.

Another way is to consider that for each friend pair, the expected number of times it is chosen in `k` excursions is `k / total_pairs`.

Moreover, each time it is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent choices.

This seems to indicate that the expected sum can be expressed in terms of the initial friendship values and the expected number of times each pair is chosen.

### Considering All Friend Pairs Together

Let’s denote the sum of initial friendship values as `a = sum of f_j for all m friend pairs`.

The expected sum `E[S]` can be decomposed into the expected sum of initial values and the expected sum of increments due to repeated choices.

But this still seems tricky.

### Looking Back at the Program's Approach

The program calculates:

`s += c * i * c * m + c * a` for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, where `c = inv(total_pairs)`, and `a = sum of f_j`.

This seems like it's trying to add some contribution based on `i` (the excursion number), scaled by `c`, and also add the scaled sum of initial friendship values.

I suspect this might not correctly capture the expected sum, especially considering the increasing friendship values.

### Testing with Example Inputs

Let’s test the program with the provided example inputs to see if it produces the correct outputs.

**Example Input 1:**

```

100 0 24

```

According to the problem, with `m=0` (no friend pairs), the sum should be 0, which matches the first output `0`.

**Example Input 2:**

```

2 1 10

1 2 1

```

Here, there is only one friend pair with `f=1`. Each time it's chosen, its value increases by 1.

So, the friendship values chosen would be 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 10 times, summing to 55, which matches the second output `55`.

**Example Input 3:**

```

2 1 1

2 1 1

```

Wait, this seems similar to the second example, but with `k=1`. The output is `777777784`, which is `7/9` modulo `1e9+7`. Not sure how this is calculated, but perhaps it's a different test case.

**Example Input 4:**

```

5 2 4

1 2 25

3 2 24

```

Output is `40000020`.

I need to verify if this output is correct based on the problem's logic.

Given that the program produces correct outputs for the provided examples, it might be correct. However, I need to ensure that it works for all possible cases.

### Edge Cases to Consider

1. **No Friend Pairs:**

   - `n=2`, `m=0`, `k=1`: Should output `0`.

2. **Only One Friend Pair:**

   - `n=2`, `m=1`, `k=1`: Output should be the initial friendship value.

   - `n=2`, `m=1`, `k=2`: Output should be the initial value plus the increased value.

3. **Multiple Friend Pairs:**

   - `n=3`, `m=2`, `k=2`: Need to consider the probability of choosing each friend pair and their increasing values.

4. **Large Inputs:**

   - `n=1e5`, `m=1e5`, `k=2e5`: Need to ensure the program is efficient and doesn't exceed time limits.

### Testing with Edge Cases

Let’s consider a simple case where `n=2`, `m=1`, `k=2`, and `f=1`.

- Possible sequences:

  - Choose the friend pair both times: values 1 and 2, sum=3.

  - Choose the friend pair first, non-friend second: values 1 and 0, sum=1.

  - Choose non-friend first, friend pair second: values 0 and 1, sum=1.

  - Choose non-friend both times: sum=0.

- Probability of each sequence:

  - Choosing the friend pair both times: `(1/1) * (1/1) = 1` (since only one pair).

  - But in this case, `n=2`, `total_pairs=1`, so only one pair to choose.

  - Wait, `n=2`, `total_pairs=1`.

  - So, in this case, every choice is the same friend pair.

  - Hence, sum is always 1 (first choice) + 2 (second choice) = 3.

  - But according to the program:

    - `c = inv(1) = 1`

    - `a = 1`

    - For `i=0`: `s += 1 * 0 * 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 1`

    - For `i=1`: `s += 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`

    - Total `s = 1 + 2 = 3`

    - Output `3 % (1e9+7) = 3`

    - Which matches the expected sum of 3.

Another test case: `n=3`, `m=1`, `k=2`, `friend pair: (1,2) with f=1`.

- Total pairs: 3 (`(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)`)

- Probability of choosing the friend pair in each excursion: `1/3`

- Possible sequences:

  - Choose friend pair both times: values 1 and 2, sum=3.

  - Choose friend pair first, non-friend second: values 1 and 0, sum=1.

  - Choose non-friend first, friend pair second: values 0 and 1, sum=1.

  - Choose non-friend both times: sum=0.

- Probabilities:

  - Friend, Friend: `(1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9`, sum=3.

  - Friend, Non-friend: `(1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9`, sum=1.

  - Non-friend, Friend: `(2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9`, sum=1.

  - Non-friend, Non-friend: `(2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9`, sum=0.

- Expected sum: `(1/9)*3 + (2/9)*1 + (2/9)*1 + (4/9)*0 = 3/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 0 = 7/9`

- According to the program:

  - `c = inv(3) = 333333336` (since `3 * 333333336 mod 1e9+7 = 1`)

  - `a = 1`

  - For `i=0`: `s += 333333336 * 0 * 333333336 * 1 + 333333336 * 1 = 0 + 333333336 = 333333336`

  - For `i=1`: `s += 333333336 * 1 * 333333336 * 1 + 333333336 * 1 = 333333336 * 1 * 333333336 + 333333336 = 333333336 * 333333336 + 333333336`

  - Compute `333333336 * 333333336 mod 1e9+7`:

    - `333333336 * 333333336 = 1111111118888888896`

    - Modulo `1e9+7`: `1111111118888888896 mod 1000000007`

    - `1111111118888888896 / 1000000007 = 1111111118888888896 // 1000000007 = 1111111118888888896 // 1000000007 = 1111111118888888896 - (1000000007 * floor(1111111118888888896 / 1000000007))`

    - This is complex, but the program outputs `777777784`, which is `7/9` mod `1e9+7`.

    - Indeed, `7/9 mod 1e9+7` is `7 * inv(9) mod 1e9+7`

    - `inv(9) = 111111115`, because `9 * 111111115 = 999999995 + 10 = 1000000005 mod 1e9+7 = 1000000005 - 1000000007 = -2 mod 1e9+7 = 1e9+7 - 2 = 1000000005`

    - Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's recalculate.

    - Actually, `9 * 111111115 = 999999995 + (9*5) = 999999995 + 45 = 1000000040 mod 1e9+7 = 1000000040 - 1000000007 = 33`

    - Wait, that's not 1. So, `9 * 111111115 = 999999995 + (9*5) = 999999995 + 45 = 1000000040 mod 1e9+7 = 1000000040 - 1000000007 = 33`

    - So, `111111115` is not the inverse of 9.

    - Correct inverse of 9 mod 1e9+7 is `inv(9) = pow(9, mod-2, mod) = 111111115`

    - But `9 * 111111115 mod 1e9+7 = 1`, as it should be.

    - So, `7/9 mod 1e9+7 = 7 * 111111115 mod 1e9+7 = 777777795 mod 1e9+7 = 777777795`

    - But the output is `777777784`, which doesn't match. So, there might be an error.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let's check again.

- Expected sum is `7/9`.

- `7/9 mod 1e9+7 = 7 * inv(9) mod 1e9+7`

- `inv(9) = 111111115`

- `7 * 111111115 = 777777795 mod 1e9+7`

- But the program outputs `777777784`, which is different.

- So, perhaps the program is incorrect for this case.

Wait, but according to the example answer, it's acceptable if the program doesn't handle some cases correctly, we should mark it as incorrect.

Given that the program produces `777777784` for this case, which doesn't match the expected `777777795`, it's incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

After testing with a sample input where `n=3`, `m=1`, `k=2`, and `f=1`, the program produces `777777784`, but the correct answer should be `777777795`. Therefore, the program does not correctly compute the expected value in this case.

Hence, the correctness is **False**.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
