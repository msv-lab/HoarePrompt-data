Alright, I've been assigned the role of a program verifier. My task is to determine whether a given Python program correctly solves the problem as described. If the program is correct for all potential cases, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to ensure that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handle all edge cases appropriately.

To understand this task better, I've been provided with some examples. Let's look at them one by one.

**Example 1:**

Problem description: Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

Program:

```python

def is_not_prime(n):

    if n < 2:

        return True

    for i in range(2, n):

        if n % i == 0:

            return True

    return False

```

Example Answer 1:

Correctness: **True**

In this example, the function `is_not_prime` is supposed to identify non-prime numbers. The function returns `True` for numbers less than 2 and for numbers that have divisors other than 1 and themselves. For prime numbers, it returns `False`. This seems correct based on the problem description.

**Example 2:**

Problem description: Write a Python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with the same characters.

Program:

```python

def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):

    count = 0

    for i in range(len(s)-1):

        for j in range(i, len(s)-1):

            if s[i] == s[j+1]:

                count += 1

    return count

```

Example Answer 2:

Correctness: **False**

Here, the function is intended to count substrings that start and end with the same character. However, the implementation seems flawed. The nested loops suggest an attempt to check pairs, but it might not be counting all possible substrings correctly. For instance, it might miss single-character substrings or have incorrect indexing. Hence, it's marked as incorrect.

**Example 3:**

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in a list.

Program:

```python

def binary_search(arr, target):

    left = 0

    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left < right:

        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:

            return mid

        elif arr[mid] < target:

            left = mid

        else:

            right = mid - 1

    if arr[left] == target:

        return left

    return -1

```

Example Answer 3:

Correctness: **False**

This binary search implementation has a flaw in the way it handles the mid index. When `arr[mid] < target`, it should set `left = mid + 1` to avoid infinite loops in certain cases. Similarly, the final check should be `if arr[left] == target` only if `left` is within bounds. This implementation might not work correctly for all inputs, hence it's incorrect.

From these examples, it's clear that I need to thoroughly analyze the given program to ensure it handles all possible cases as per the problem description. If there's even a single case where the program doesn't behave as expected, I should mark it as incorrect.

Now, let's move on to the actual task.

**Your task:**

Problem description: Determine if a given array of numbers can form a "progressive square" based on the parameters n, c, d.

A progressive square of size n is an n x n matrix constructed using the formula:

a[i][j] = a[0][0] + i*c + j*d

Given n, c, d, and an array b of n^2 integers, check if the sorted array b matches the sorted progressive square.

Input:

- t (number of test cases)

- For each test case:

- n, c, d

- n^2 integers representing array b

Output:

- "YES" if the array can form the progressive square

- "NO" otherwise

Constraints:

- 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4

- 2 ≤ n ≤ 500

- 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6

- 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9

- Sum of n^2 over all test cases ≤ 25 * 10^4

Example:

Input:

5

3 2 3

3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8

3 2 3

3 9 6 5 7 1 11 4 8

2 100 100

400 300 400 500

3 2 3

3 9 6 6 5 1 11 4 8

4 4 4

15 27 7 19 23 23 11 15 7 3 19 23 11 15 11 15

Output:

NO

YES

YES

NO

NO

Given Program:

```python

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())

    l = list(map(int, input().split()))

    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):

    a = min(l)

    li = []

    for k in range(0, n):

        for h in range(0, n):

            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)

    li.sort()

    l.sort()

    if l == li:

        return 'yes'

    return 'no'

```

To verify the correctness of this program, I need to ensure that it correctly identifies whether the given array `b` can form the progressive square for the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.

Let's break down the program:

1. Read the number of test cases `t`.

2. For each test case:

a. Read `n`, `c`, `d`.

b. Read the array `l` of `n^2` integers.

c. Call `func_1(n, c, d, l)` and print its result.

3. Definition of `func_1`:

a. Find the minimum value `a` in `l`.

b. Generate the progressive square values into list `li` using the formula `a + k*c + h*d` for `k` and `h` from 0 to n-1.

c. Sort both `li` and `l`.

d. If the sorted lists match, return 'yes'; else, return 'no'.

First, I need to understand the construction of the progressive square. Given `a[0][0]`, `c`, and `d`, each element in the square is calculated as:

a[i][j] = a[0][0] + i*c + j*d

The program assumes that the minimum value in the array `l` is `a[0][0]`. It then generates the expected progressive square values based on this assumption and checks if sorting both lists results in identical sequences.

I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Potential issues to consider:

1. **Correctness of assuming the minimum value as `a[0][0]`**:

- Since all elements in the square are generated by adding non-negative multiples of `c` and `d` to `a[0][0]`, the minimum value should indeed be `a[0][0]` if both `c` and `d` are non-negative.

- However, the problem states that `1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6`, so both `c` and `d` are positive. Therefore, the minimum value in the square is indeed `a[0][0]`.

2. **Uniqueness of the progressive square**:

- The problem mentions that for any `n`, `a[0][0]`, `c`, and `d`, there exists exactly one progressive square. This ensures that the generated square is unique.

3. **Sorting the lists**:

- By sorting both the generated progressive square list and the input array, we can compare them to check if they contain the same elements, regardless of order.

- This seems correct since the problem allows the array `b` to be in any order.

4. **Edge cases**:

- Small `n` values: e.g., `n=2`.

- Large `n` values: up to `n=500`, but the constraints ensure that the total input size is manageable.

- Maximum values for `c` and `d`: up to `10^6`, which, combined with `n=500`, could lead to large numbers, but Python handles big integers well.

- All elements in `b` are the same: only possible if `c=0` and `d=0`, but since `c` and `d` are at least 1, this isn't possible.

- Negative values: not applicable since `c` and `d` are positive and `a[0][0]` is at least 1.

5. **Performance considerations**:

- The program reads inputs and processes each test case sequentially.

- For each test case, it performs a double loop to generate `li`, which is O(n^2), and sorting both lists, which is O(n^2 log n^2).

- Given that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 25 * 10^4, and n <= 500, this should be efficient enough.

6. **Correctness of the progressive square generation**:

- The program correctly generates the progressive square values using the formula `a + k*c + h*d`.

- It iterates `k` from 0 to n-1 and `h` from 0 to n-1, appending each calculated value to `li`.

7. **Comparison of sorted lists**:

- By sorting both `li` and `l`, the program checks if they contain the same elements.

- This is a valid way to verify if the array `b` can form the progressive square.

Potential error-prone parts:

- Assuming that the minimum value in `l` is `a[0][0]`. Although it seems correct given the constraints, I need to confirm this.

- Possible off-by-one errors in the loops, but the ranges are from 0 to n-1, which is correct.

- Case sensitivity in the output: the problem allows any case, but the function returns 'yes' and 'no' in lowercase. However, the problem statement says that any case is acceptable, so this should be fine.

- Data types: all variables are integers, and Python handles large integers well.

- Input reading: ensuring that all inputs are read correctly and no extra spaces or misreads.

- The function `func_1` is defined after its usage, which is acceptable in Python as long as it's defined before its first call.

Let's consider some test cases to verify the program.

**Test Case 1:**

Input:

3 2 3

3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8

Expected Output:

NO

According to the problem, this should return "NO", meaning that the array does not match the progressive square.

Let's see:

- n=3, c=2, d=3

- Array: [3,9,6,5,7,1,10,4,8]

- Assuming a[0][0] = min(l) = 1

- Generate li:

  - a[0][0] = 1

  - a[0][0] + 0*2 + 0*3 = 1

  - a[0][0] + 0*2 + 1*3 = 1 + 0 + 3 = 4

  - a[0][0] + 0*2 + 2*3 = 1 + 0 + 6 = 7

  - a[0][0] + 1*2 + 0*3 = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3

  - a[0][0] + 1*2 + 1*3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

  - a[0][0] + 1*2 + 2*3 = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9

  - a[0][0] + 2*2 + 0*3 = 1 + 4 + 0 = 5

  - a[0][0] + 2*2 + 1*3 = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8

  - a[0][0] + 2*2 + 2*3 = 1 + 4 + 6 = 11

- So, li = [1,4,7,3,6,9,5,8,11]

- Sorted li: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

- Sorted l: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

- They differ (11 vs 10), hence "NO"

**Test Case 2:**

Input:

3 2 3

3 9 6 5 7 1 11 4 8

Expected Output:

YES

- n=3, c=2, d=3

- Array: [3,9,6,5,7,1,11,4,8]

- a[0][0] = 1

- li as above: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

- Sorted l: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

- Match, so "YES"

**Test Case 3:**

Input:

2 100 100

400 300 400 500

Expected Output:

YES

- n=2, c=100, d=100

- Array: [400,300,400,500]

- a[0][0] = 300

- li:

  - a[0][0] + 0*100 + 0*100 = 300

  - a[0][0] + 0*100 + 1*100 = 300 + 0 + 100 = 400

  - a[0][0] + 1*100 + 0*100 = 300 + 100 + 0 = 400

  - a[0][0] + 1*100 + 1*100 = 300 + 100 + 100 = 500

- li = [300,400,400,500]

- Sorted li: [300,400,400,500]

- Sorted l: [300,400,400,500]

- Match, so "YES"

**Test Case 4:**

Input:

3 2 3

3 9 6 6 5 1 11 4 8

Expected Output:

NO

- n=3, c=2, d=3

- Array: [3,9,6,6,5,1,11,4,8]

- a[0][0] = 1

- li as above: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

- Sorted l: [1,3,4,5,6,6,8,9,11]

- They differ (extra 6), so "NO"

**Test Case 5:**

Input:

4 4 4

15 27 7 19 23 23 11 15 7 3 19 23 11 15 11 15

Expected Output:

NO

- n=4, c=4, d=4

- Array: [15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15]

- a[0][0] = 3

- li:

  - a[0][0] + 0*4 + 0*4 = 3

  - a[0][0] + 0*4 + 1*4 = 3 + 0 + 4 = 7

  - a[0][0] + 0*4 + 2*4 = 3 + 0 + 8 = 11

  - a[0][0] + 0*4 + 3*4 = 3 + 0 + 12 = 15

  - a[0][0] + 1*4 + 0*4 = 3 + 4 + 0 = 7

  - a[0][0] + 1*4 + 1*4 = 3 + 4 + 4 = 11

  - a[0][0] + 1*4 + 2*4 = 3 + 4 + 8 = 15

  - a[0][0] + 1*4 + 3*4 = 3 + 4 + 12 = 19

  - a[0][0] + 2*4 + 0*4 = 3 + 8 + 0 = 11

  - a[0][0] + 2*4 + 1*4 = 3 + 8 + 4 = 15

  - a[0][0] + 2*4 + 2*4 = 3 + 8 + 8 = 19

  - a[0][0] + 2*4 + 3*4 = 3 + 8 + 12 = 23

  - a[0][0] + 3*4 + 0*4 = 3 + 12 + 0 = 15

  - a[0][0] + 3*4 + 1*4 = 3 + 12 + 4 = 19

  - a[0][0] + 3*4 + 2*4 = 3 + 12 + 8 = 23

  - a[0][0] + 3*4 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 + 12 = 27

- li = [3,7,11,15,7,11,15,19,11,15,19,23,15,19,23,27]

- Sorted li: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,19,23,23,27]

- Sorted l: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,19,23,23,27]

- Match, so should be "YES", but the expected output is "NO". Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, in the given example, the output is "NO", but according to this, it should be "YES". This suggests that either the example output is incorrect or there's a mistake in my calculation.

Let me check the array again:

Given array: [15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15]

Sorted array: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,19,23,23,27]

Generated li: [3,7,11,15,7,11,15,19,11,15,19,23,15,19,23,27]

Sorted li: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,19,23,23,27]

They match, so the program should output "YES", but the example shows "NO". This indicates that there might be an error in the program.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the generated li. Let's recalculate:

Given n=4, c=4, d=4, a[0][0]=3

a[0][0] + 0*4 + 0*4 = 3

a[0][0] + 0*4 + 1*4 = 7

a[0][0] + 0*4 + 2*4 = 11

a[0][0] + 0*4 + 3*4 = 15

a[0][0] + 1*4 + 0*4 = 7

a[0][0] + 1*4 + 1*4 = 11

a[0][0] + 1*4 + 2*4 = 15

a[0][0] + 1*4 + 3*4 = 19

a[0][0] + 2*4 + 0*4 = 11

a[0][0] + 2*4 + 1*4 = 15

a[0][0] + 2*4 + 2*4 = 19

a[0][0] + 2*4 + 3*4 = 23

a[0][0] + 3*4 + 0*4 = 15

a[0][0] + 3*4 + 1*4 = 19

a[0][0] + 3*4 + 2*4 = 23

a[0][0] + 3*4 + 3*4 = 27

So li = [3,7,11,15,7,11,15,19,11,15,19,23,15,19,23,27]

Sorted li: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,19,23,23,27]

Sorted l: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,19,23,23,27]

They match, so the program should output "YES", but the example output is "NO". This suggests that there's an error in the program's logic.

Possible reasons:

- The program might be incorrectly assuming that the minimum value is always a[0][0].

- Perhaps there are cases where the minimum value is not a[0][0].

Wait, in the problem statement, it's mentioned that a[0][0] is chosen by Maxim, but in the program, it's assumed to be the minimum value of the array. Given that c and d are positive, a[0][0] is indeed the minimum value. So, in this case, it should be correct.

However, according to the example, the output is "NO", which contradicts my calculation. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in how the progressive square is constructed.

Looking back at the problem description:

"A progressive square of size n is an n x n matrix. Maxim chooses three integers a_{1,1}, c, and d and constructs a progressive square according to the following rules:

For example, if n = 3, a_{1,1} = 1, c=2, and d=3, then the progressive square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of n, c, and d. Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific square.

It can be shown that for any values of n, a_{1,1}, c, and d, there exists exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules."

Wait, the problem mentions "a_{1,1}", which is likely a[1][1] in 1-based indexing, but in the program, it's treated as a[0][0] in 0-based indexing.

However, in the example calculation, treating a[0][0] as the minimum value seems correct.

Given that, and the discrepancy in the last test case, perhaps there's an issue with duplicate values.

Wait, in the last test case, there are multiple 15s, 19s, etc., but the sorted arrays match, so according to the program, it should be "YES".

Since the example output is "NO", there must be something wrong with the program's logic.

Alternative approach:

Perhaps the problem requires that the array can be arranged into the matrix in the exact structure, not just containing the same elements.

But the problem says: "the elements found by Maxim in random order and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific square."

So, it seems like checking if the sorted array matches the sorted progressive square is correct.

Given that, and my earlier calculation, the program should output "YES" for the last test case, but the example shows "NO". This suggests that the program is incorrect.

Possible reasons:

- Maybe the progressive square has unique values, but the array has duplicates.

Wait, in the last test case, the progressive square has multiple 15s, 19s, etc., so duplicates are possible.

Wait, in my calculation, sorted li and sorted l match, but the expected output is "NO". This suggests that there might be a miscalculation.

Let me double-check the progressive square generation:

Given n=4, c=4, d=4, a[0][0]=3

a[0][0] + 0*4 + 0*4 = 3

a[0][0] + 0*4 + 1*4 = 7

a[0][0] + 0*4 + 2*4 = 11

a[0][0] + 0*4 + 3*4 = 15

a[0][0] + 1*4 + 0*4 = 7

a[0][0] + 1*4 + 1*4 = 11

a[0][0] + 1*4 + 2*4 = 15

a[0][0] + 1*4 + 3*4 = 19

a[0][0] + 2*4 + 0*4 = 11

a[0][0] + 2*4 + 1*4 = 15

a[0][0] + 2*4 + 2*4 = 19

a[0][0] + 2*4 + 3*4 = 23

a[0][0] + 3*4 + 0*4 = 15

a[0][0] + 3*4 + 1*4 = 19

a[0][0] + 3*4 + 2*4 = 23

a[0][0] + 3*4 + 3*4 = 27

So li = [3,7,11,15,7,11,15,19,11,15,19,23,15,19,23,27]

Sorted li: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,19,23,23,27]

Given array: [15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15]

Sorted l: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,27]

Wait, I see that in the sorted l, there are only two 19s, but in sorted li, there are three 19s. Similarly, in sorted l, there are four 15s, which matches sorted li.

Wait, no, in sorted li, there are three 19s, but in sorted l, there are only two 19s.

Wait, let's count:

- Sorted li: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,19,23,23,27]

- Sorted l: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,27]

So, sorted li has three 19s, but sorted l has only two 19s. Hence, they don't match, so it should be "NO".

I must have miscalculated earlier. The program would incorrectly say "YES" in this case, which is wrong.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

So, the Correctness is **False**.

Explanation:

The program assumes that sorting both the generated progressive square list and the input array and comparing them is sufficient to determine if the array can form the progressive square. However, this approach fails when the progressive square has duplicate values that need to match exactly in the input array.

In the last test case, the progressive square has three 19s, but the input array has only two 19s. The sorted lists would appear to match if we don't account for the exact frequency of each value.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the frequency of each value in the input array matches exactly with the frequency in the progressive square.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \textbf{False}} \]
