Alright, I've got this task here. I need to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible input case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that even if the program fails for just one input case, it's considered incorrect.

Let's start by understanding the problem description and the provided program.

### Problem Description

Alice has `n` coins and wants to buy exactly `k` jewels from Bob's jewelry store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with an unlimited number of jewels, and set the price per jewel for each stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^18.

Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order, buys as many jewels as possible with her remaining coins, and proceeds to the next stall until she has visited all stalls.

Our task is to determine if Bob can choose the number of stalls and set the prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. If it's possible, we should output "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the prices for each stall. If it's impossible, we should output "NO".

### Provided Program

The provided program attempts to solve this problem with a function `func_1(n, k)`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If `n == k`, it means Alice can buy one jewel per coin, so it sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - If `n < k`, it's impossible because Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy `k` jewels, so it outputs "NO".

2. **General Case:**
   - For other cases, it sets up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall:
     - From the first stall, she buys as many jewels as possible with price `n - k + 1`.
     - From the second stall, she buys as many jewels as possible with the remaining coins at price 1.
   - It sums up the jewels bought from both stalls and checks if it equals `k`. If not, it outputs "NO".

### Analysis

Let's analyze whether this approach is correct.

#### Correctness of Base Cases

1. **n == k:**
   - Setting up one stall with price 1 is correct because Alice will buy one jewel per coin, totaling `k` jewels.
   
2. **n < k:**
   - It's impossible to buy more jewels than the number of coins available, so "NO" is correct.

#### General Case Analysis

The general approach sets up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

- **First Stall:**
  - Price per jewel: `p1 = n - k + 1`
  - Maximum jewels Alice can buy: `j1 = n // p1`
  - Coins spent: `spent1 = j1 * p1`
  - Remaining coins: `n - spent1`

- **Second Stall:**
  - Price per jewel: `p2 = 1`
  - Maximum jewels Alice can buy: `j2 = remaining coins // p2 = remaining coins`
  
- **Total jewels bought:** `j1 + j2`

The goal is to have `j1 + j2 = k`.

Let's see if this always holds.

#### Example Verification

Take the first example from the problem:

- `n = 7`, `k = 3`

- Prices: `[7 - 3 + 1 = 5, 1]`

- First stall: `7 // 5 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `5`, remaining: `2`

- Second stall: `2 // 1 = 2` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 2 = 3` which matches `k`

Another example:

- `n = 255`, `k = 8`

- Prices: `[255 - 8 + 1 = 248, 1]`

- First stall: `255 // 248 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `248`, remaining: `7`

- Second stall: `7 // 1 = 7` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 7 = 8` which matches `k`

Seems correct for these cases.

#### Potential Issues

Is there any case where this approach fails?

Consider:

- `n = 4`, `k = 2`

- Prices: `[4 - 2 + 1 = 3, 1]`

- First stall: `4 // 3 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `3`, remaining: `1`

- Second stall: `1 // 1 = 1` jewel

- Total jewels: `1 + 1 = 2` which matches `k`

Another case:

- `n = 5`, `k = 2`

- Prices: `[5 - 2 + 1 = 4, 1]`

- First stall: `5 // 4 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `4`, remaining: `1`

- Second stall: `1 // 1 = 1` jewel

- Total jewels: `1 + 1 = 2` which matches `k`

Seems consistent.

Wait, let's try:

- `n = 3`, `k = 2`

- Prices: `[3 - 2 + 1 = 2, 1]`

- First stall: `3 // 2 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `2`, remaining: `1`

- Second stall: `1 // 1 = 1` jewel

- Total jewels: `1 + 1 = 2` which matches `k`

Another case:

- `n = 10`, `k = 5`

- Prices: `[10 - 5 + 1 = 6, 1]`

- First stall: `10 // 6 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `6`, remaining: `4`

- Second stall: `4 // 1 = 4` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 4 = 5` which matches `k`

Seems to work.

But what if:

- `n = 1`, `k = 1`

- Prices: `[1 - 1 + 1 = 1, 1]`

- First stall: `1 // 1 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `1`, remaining: `0`

- Second stall: `0 // 1 = 0` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 0 = 1` which matches `k`

Good.

Another edge case:

- `n = 1`, `k = 0`

- According to the base case, since `n < k` is False, and `n == k` is False, it would go to the general case.

- But `k = 0` is invalid because `k` is a positive integer as per the problem statement.

Wait, the problem states that `k` is a positive integer (`1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`), so `k = 0` is not allowed.

Hence, no need to handle `k = 0`.

Another edge case:

- `n = 2`, `k = 1`

- Prices: `[2 - 1 + 1 = 2, 1]`

- First stall: `2 // 2 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `2`, remaining: `0`

- Second stall: `0 // 1 = 0` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 0 = 1` which matches `k`

Looks good.

Wait, is there any case where `n - k + 1` is less than or equal to 1, which might cause issues?

Let's see:

- `n = 5`, `k = 5`

- Prices: `[5 - 5 + 1 = 1, 1]`

- First stall: `5 // 1 = 5` jewels, coins spent: `5`, remaining: `0`

- Second stall: `0 // 1 = 0` jewels

- Total jewels: `5 + 0 = 5` which matches `k`

This seems correct, but wait, in the base case, if `n == k`, it sets up one stall with price 1. So, in this case, it would actually use the base case and set up one stall with price 1, which is correct.

But in the general case, it sets up two stalls: `[1,1]`, which also works.

So, it's redundant but still correct.

Another case:

- `n = 10`, `k = 10`

- Base case: `n == k`, set up one stall with price 1.

- But in general case, it would set up `[10 - 10 + 1 = 1, 1]`, which also works.

Again, redundant but correct.

What if `n - k + 1` is greater than `n`?

Wait, `n - k + 1`:

- Since `n >= k` (as per the problem, since `n` and `k` are positive integers and `n >= k` is allowed), `n - k + 1` can be as low as 1 when `n = k`.

- It cannot be greater than `n` because `k` can be 1, making `n - 1 + 1 = n`.

Hence, no issue there.

Wait, what if `n = 1`, `k = 1`:

- Prices: `[1 - 1 + 1 = 1, 1]`

- As above, works correctly.

Another consideration:

- The problem allows up to 60 stalls, but this solution only uses 2 stalls.

- So, it's within the limit.

- Also, the prices are within the allowed range `1 <= p_i <= 10^18`.

Hence, seems correct.

But let's think deeper.

Is there any case where using only two stalls cannot achieve the required `k`, but with more stalls, it can?

I need to think of such a case.

Suppose `n = 5`, `k = 3`

- Using two stalls: `[5 - 3 + 1 = 3, 1]`

- First stall: `5 // 3 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `3`, remaining: `2`

- Second stall: `2 // 1 = 2` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 2 = 3` which matches `k`

Seems correct.

Another case: `n = 6`, `k = 4`

- Prices: `[6 - 4 + 1 = 3, 1]`

- First stall: `6 // 3 = 2` jewels, coins spent: `6`, remaining: `0`

- Second stall: `0 // 1 = 0` jewels

- Total jewels: `2 + 0 = 2` which is less than `k = 4`

Wait, this seems incorrect.

Wait, according to the code, it would check if `h < k`, where `h = j1 + j2`.

In this case, `h = 2 < 4`, so it would output "NO".

But is it actually impossible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with `n = 6` coins?

Let's see:

- Suppose Bob sets up two stalls with prices `[2, 1]`

- First stall: `6 // 2 = 3` jewels, coins spent: `6`, remaining: `0`

- Second stall: `0 // 1 = 0` jewels

- Total jewels: `3 + 0 = 3`, which is less than `k = 4`

- Not enough.

- Try three stalls: `[3, 1, 1]`

- First stall: `6 // 3 = 2` jewels, coins spent: `6`, remaining: `0`

- Second stall: `0 // 1 = 0` jewels

- Third stall: `0 // 1 = 0` jewels

- Total: `2 + 0 + 0 = 2`, still less than `k = 4`

- Not good.

- Try `[2, 2, 1]`

- First stall: `6 // 2 = 3` jewels, coins spent: `6`, remaining: `0`

- Second stall: `0 // 2 = 0` jewels

- Third stall: `0 // 1 = 0` jewels

- Total: `3 + 0 + 0 = 3`, still less than `k = 4`

- Not sufficient.

- Try `[1, 1, 1]`

- First stall: `6 // 1 = 6` jewels, coins spent: `6`, remaining: `0`

- Second stall: `0 // 1 = 0` jewels

- Third stall: `0 // 1 = 0` jewels

- Total: `6 + 0 + 0 = 6`, which is more than `k = 4`

- But the code would output "NO" in this case, which is incorrect because it's possible to buy more than `k` jewels, but we need exactly `k`.

Wait, but according to the problem, Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. So, if it's impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, we should output "NO".

In this case, with `n = 6`, `k = 4`, it seems impossible to set up any number of stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels.

- With one stall: price `p = 6 // 1 = 1` jewel, remaining coins: `0`, total jewels: 1

- With two stalls: `[p1, p2]`

- If `p1 = 3`, `p2 = 1`: jewels = 2 + 0 = 2

- If `p1 = 2`, `p2 = 1`: jewels = 3 + 0 = 3

- If `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`: jewels = 6 + 0 = 6

- With three stalls: similar issues as above.

Hence, it's indeed impossible to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with `n = 6`.

So, in this case, the code correctly identifies it as "NO".

Wait, but in the earlier step, the code calculates `h = j1 + j2 = 2 < 4`, so it outputs "NO", which is correct.

Wait, but is it always correct?

Wait, maybe I need to think of a case where `h >= k`, but Alice can't buy exactly `k` jewels.

Let's consider `n = 7`, `k = 4`

- Prices: `[7 - 4 + 1 = 4, 1]`

- First stall: `7 // 4 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `4`, remaining: `3`

- Second stall: `3 // 1 = 3` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 3 = 4` which matches `k`

- So, "YES"

This seems correct.

Another case: `n = 10`, `k = 5`

- Prices: `[10 - 5 + 1 = 6, 1]`

- First stall: `10 // 6 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `6`, remaining: `4`

- Second stall: `4 // 1 = 4` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 4 = 5` which matches `k`

- So, "YES"

Good.

What about `n = 8`, `k = 5`

- Prices: `[8 - 5 + 1 = 4, 1]`

- First stall: `8 // 4 = 2` jewels, coins spent: `8`, remaining: `0`

- Second stall: `0 // 1 = 0` jewels

- Total jewels: `2 + 0 = 2 < 5`

- So, "NO"

Is it actually possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 5 jewels with `n = 8`?

- With one stall: price `p = 8 // 1 = 8` jewels, which is more than `k`

- With two stalls: `[p1, p2]`

- If `p1 = 4`, `p2 = 1`: jewels = 2 + 0 = 2

- If `p1 = 3`, `p2 = 1`: jewels = 2 + 2 = 4

- If `p1 = 2`, `p2 = 1`: jewels = 4 + 0 = 4

- If `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`: jewels = 8 + 0 = 8

- With three stalls: `[p1, p2, p3]`

- `[3, 2, 1]`: jewels = 2 + 1 + 0 = 3

- `[2, 2, 1]`: jewels = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4

- `[2, 1, 1]`: jewels = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4

- `[1, 1, 1]`: jewels = 8 + 0 + 0 = 8

- It seems impossible to make Alice buy exactly 5 jewels.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Another case: `n = 10`, `k = 3`

- Prices: `[10 - 3 + 1 = 8, 1]`

- First stall: `10 // 8 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `8`, remaining: `2`

- Second stall: `2 // 1 = 2` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 2 = 3` which matches `k`

- So, "YES"

Seems correct.

Wait, but what if `n = 10`, `k = 4`

- Prices: `[10 - 4 + 1 = 7, 1]`

- First stall: `10 // 7 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `7`, remaining: `3`

- Second stall: `3 // 1 = 3` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 3 = 4` which matches `k`

- So, "YES"

Correct.

Another case: `n = 10`, `k = 6`

- Prices: `[10 - 6 + 1 = 5, 1]`

- First stall: `10 // 5 = 2` jewels, coins spent: `10`, remaining: `0`

- Second stall: `0 // 1 = 0` jewels

- Total jewels: `2 + 0 = 2 < 6`

- So, "NO"

Is it possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 6 jewels with `n = 10`?

- With one stall: price `p = 10 // 1 = 10` jewels, which is more than `k`

- With two stalls: `[p1, p2]`

- `[5, 1]`: jewels = 2 + 0 = 2

- `[4, 1]`: jewels = 2 + 2 = 4

- `[3, 1]`: jewels = 3 + 1 = 4

- `[2, 1]`: jewels = 5 + 0 = 5

- `[1, 1]`: jewels = 10 + 0 = 10

- With three stalls: `[3, 2, 1]`: jewels = 3 + 1 + 0 = 4

- `[2, 2, 1]`: jewels = 5 + 0 + 0 = 5

- `[2, 1, 1]`: jewels = 5 + 0 + 0 = 5

- `[1, 1, 1]`: jewels = 10 + 0 + 0 = 10

- Seems impossible to make Alice buy exactly 6 jewels.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Wait, but `n = 10`, `k = 5`

- Prices: `[10 - 5 + 1 = 6, 1]`

- First stall: `10 // 6 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `6`, remaining: `4`

- Second stall: `4 // 1 = 4` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 4 = 5` which matches `k`

- So, "YES"

Correct.

Another case: `n = 15`, `k = 5`

- Prices: `[15 - 5 + 1 = 11, 1]`

- First stall: `15 // 11 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `11`, remaining: `4`

- Second stall: `4 // 1 = 4` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 4 = 5` which matches `k`

- So, "YES"

Good.

Wait, but what if `n = 15`, `k = 6`

- Prices: `[15 - 6 + 1 = 10, 1]`

- First stall: `15 // 10 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `10`, remaining: `5`

- Second stall: `5 // 1 = 5` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 5 = 6` which matches `k`

- So, "YES"

Correct.

Another case: `n = 15`, `k = 4`

- Prices: `[15 - 4 + 1 = 12, 1]`

- First stall: `15 // 12 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `12`, remaining: `3`

- Second stall: `3 // 1 = 3` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 3 = 4` which matches `k`

- So, "YES"

Good.

Wait, but earlier I thought that `n = 10`, `k = 6` is impossible, and the code correctly outputs "NO".

Hence, in that case, the code is correct.

Wait, but perhaps there are cases where `h >= k`, but Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels.

Let me think of such a case.

Consider `n = 10`, `k = 7`

- Prices: `[10 - 7 + 1 = 4, 1]`

- First stall: `10 // 4 = 2` jewels, coins spent: `8`, remaining: `2`

- Second stall: `2 // 1 = 2` jewels

- Total jewels: `2 + 2 = 4 < 7`

- So, "NO"

Is it possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 7 jewels with `n = 10`?

- With one stall: price `p = 10 // 1 = 10` jewels, which is more than `k`

- With two stalls: `[p1, p2]`

- `[4, 1]`: jewels = 2 + 2 = 4

- `[3, 1]`: jewels = 3 + 1 = 4

- `[2, 1]`: jewels = 5 + 0 = 5

- `[1, 1]`: jewels = 10 + 0 = 10

- With three stalls: `[3, 2, 1]`: jewels = 3 + 1 + 0 = 4

- `[2, 2, 1]`: jewels = 5 + 0 + 0 = 5

- `[2, 1, 1]`: jewels = 5 + 0 + 0 = 5

- `[1, 1, 1]`: jewels = 10 + 0 + 0 = 10

- Still, no combination gives exactly 7 jewels.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Another case: `n = 10`, `k = 5`

- As above, "YES"

Seems consistent.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct.

But to be thorough, let's consider a case where `k` is very close to `n`.

- `n = 100`, `k = 99`

- Prices: `[100 - 99 + 1 = 2, 1]`

- First stall: `100 // 2 = 50` jewels, coins spent: `100`, remaining: `0`

- Second stall: `0 // 1 = 0` jewels

- Total jewels: `50 + 0 = 50 < 99`

- So, "NO"

Is it possible to make Alice buy exactly 99 jewels with `n = 100`?

- With one stall: price `p = 100 // 1 = 100` jewels, which is more than `k`

- With two stalls: `[p1, p2]`

- `[50, 1]`: jewels = 2 + 0 = 2

- `[10, 1]`: jewels = 10 + 0 = 10

- `[2, 1]`: jewels = 50 + 0 = 50

- `[1, 1]`: jewels = 100 + 0 = 100

- With more stalls, similar issues.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Another case: `n = 100`, `k = 100`

- Base case: `n == k`, set up one stall with price 1.

- Alice buys 100 jewels, which matches `k`

- So, "YES"

Correct.

Wait, but what if `n = 100`, `k = 101`

- `n < k`, so "NO"

Correct.

Seems like the code handles these cases correctly.

But perhaps there are cases where `h >= k`, but the exact `k` cannot be achieved.

Wait, let's consider `n = 10`, `k = 4`

- As above, "YES" with prices `[6,1]` giving `1 + 3 = 4`

Correct.

Another case: `n = 10`, `k = 3`

- Prices: `[10 - 3 + 1 = 8, 1]`

- First stall: `10 // 8 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `8`, remaining: `2`

- Second stall: `2 // 1 = 2` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 2 = 3` which matches `k`

- So, "YES"

Good.

Wait, but what if `n = 10`, `k = 2`

- Prices: `[10 - 2 + 1 = 9, 1]`

- First stall: `10 // 9 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `9`, remaining: `1`

- Second stall: `1 // 1 = 1` jewel

- Total jewels: `1 + 1 = 2` which matches `k`

- So, "YES"

Correct.

Another case: `n = 10`, `k = 1`

- Base case: `n == k`, set up one stall with price 1.

- Alice buys 10 jewels, which is more than `k`

- But according to the base case, it would set up one stall with price 1 and output "YES"

- Wait, but this is incorrect because Alice would buy 10 jewels, not 1.

- Wait, according to the base case:

  - If `n == k`, output "YES" with one stall of price 1.

  - But in this case, Alice would buy `n // 1 = n` jewels, which is `10`, not `1`.

  - So, this is incorrect.

Hence, there is a flaw in the base case.

Wait, in the base case, if `n == k`, it sets up one stall with price 1, and Alice buys `n` jewels, which is equal to `k` only if `n == k`.

Wait, but in this case, `n == k == 10`, but Alice buys `10` jewels, which matches `k = 10`.

Wait, no, wait, in this case, `n = 10`, `k = 10`, so `n == k`, and Alice buys `10 // 1 = 10` jewels, which matches `k = 10`.

Hence, it's correct.

Wait, but in the earlier step, you thought it was incorrect, but actually, it's correct.

Hence, no issue.

So, perhaps the code is correct.

But to be thorough, let's think of another potential flaw.

Suppose `n = 5`, `k = 3`

- Prices: `[5 - 3 + 1 = 3, 1]`

- First stall: `5 // 3 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `3`, remaining: `2`

- Second stall: `2 // 1 = 2` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 2 = 3` which matches `k`

- So, "YES"

Correct.

Another case: `n = 5`, `k = 4`

- Prices: `[5 - 4 + 1 = 2, 1]`

- First stall: `5 // 2 = 2` jewels, coins spent: `4`, remaining: `1`

- Second stall: `1 // 1 = 1` jewel

- Total jewels: `2 + 1 = 3 < 4`

- So, "NO"

Is it possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with `n = 5`?

- With one stall: price `p = 5 // 1 = 5` jewels, which is more than `k`

- With two stalls: `[p1, p2]`

- `[2,1]`: jewels = 2 + 1 = 3

- `[1,1]`: jewels = 5 + 0 = 5

- With three stalls: `[1,1,1]`: jewels = 5 + 0 + 0 = 5

- Still, no combination gives exactly 4 jewels.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Another case: `n = 100`, `k = 50`

- Prices: `[100 - 50 + 1 = 51, 1]`

- First stall: `100 // 51 = 1` jewel, coins spent: `51`, remaining: `49`

- Second stall: `49 // 1 = 49` jewels

- Total jewels: `1 + 49 = 50` which matches `k`

- So, "YES"

Correct.

Wait, but what if `n = 100`, `k = 51`

- Prices: `[100 - 51 + 1 = 50, 1]`

- First stall: `100 // 50 = 2` jewels, coins spent: `100`, remaining: `0`

- Second stall: `0 // 1 = 0` jewels

- Total jewels: `2 + 0 = 2 < 51`

- So, "NO"

Is it possible to make Alice buy exactly 51 jewels with `n = 100`?

- With one stall: price `p = 100 // 1 = 100` jewels, which is more than `k`

- With two stalls: `[p1, p2]`

- `[50,1]`: jewels = 2 + 0 = 2

- `[25,1]`: jewels = 4 + 0 = 4

- `[10,1]`: jewels = 10 + 0 = 10

- `[5,1]`: jewels = 20 + 0 = 20

- `[2,1]`: jewels = 50 + 0 = 50

- `[1,1]`: jewels = 100 + 0 = 100

- With three stalls: similar issues, total jewels are less than `k` or more than `k`

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Seems like the code handles all these cases correctly.

But to be absolutely sure, let's consider the general case.

Suppose `n` and `k` are such that `n >= k`, and `n - k + 1` is used as the price for the first stall, and `1` for the second stall.

- Jewels bought from first stall: `j1 = n // p1 = n // (n - k + 1)`

- Coins spent: `spent1 = j1 * (n - k + 1)`

- Remaining coins: `n - spent1`

- Jewels bought from second stall: `j2 = remaining coins // 1 = n - spent1`

- Total jewels: `j1 + j2 = j1 + (n - spent1) = j1 + n - j1 * (n - k + 1)`

We need `j1 + n - j1 * (n - k + 1) = k`

Let's solve for `j1`:

`j1 + n - j1 * (n - k + 1) = k`

`n + j1 * (1 - (n - k + 1)) = k`

`n + j1 * (1 - n + k - 1) = k`

`n + j1 * (k - n) = k`

`n + j1 * (k - n) = k`

`j1 * (k - n) = k - n`

`j1 = (k - n) / (k - n) = 1`

So, `j1 = 1`

Hence, `j1 = 1`, and `j2 = n - (n - k + 1) = n - n + k - 1 = k - 1`

Total jewels: `1 + (k - 1) = k`

Hence, it works.

Therefore, the approach is correct.

### Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific pricing such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. The solution involves a careful selection of stall prices to control the number of jewels Alice purchases based on her greedy buying behavior.

#### Approach
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `n == k`, set up one stall with price 1. Alice will buy one jewel per coin, totaling `k` jewels.
   - If `n < k`, it's impossible because Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy `k` jewels.

2. **General Case**:
   - Set up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - Calculate the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall:
     - From the first stall: `j1 = n // p1`
     - From the second stall: `j2 = (n - (j1 * p1)) // p2`
   - Check if the total jewels `j1 + j2` equals `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - If the total jewels equal `k`, output "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices.
   - If not, output "NO".

#### Solution Code
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        h += curr
        n -= i * curr
    if h < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(len(costs))
        print(' '.join(map(str, costs)))
```

#### Explanation
- **Base Cases**:
  - When `n == k`, setting up one stall with price 1 ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
  - When `n < k`, it's impossible to buy `k` jewels, hence "NO".

- **General Case**:
  - By setting prices as `[n - k + 1, 1]`, we ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels:
    - From the first stall, Alice buys `j1 = n // (n - k + 1)` jewels.
    - From the second stall, she buys `j2 = (n - (j1 * (n - k + 1))) // 1` jewels.
    - The sum `j1 + j2` equals `k`, as mathematically proven.

This approach guarantees that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, provided it's possible within the constraints, and adheres to the problem's requirements.
