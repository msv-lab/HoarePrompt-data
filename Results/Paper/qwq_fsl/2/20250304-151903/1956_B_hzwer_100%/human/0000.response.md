Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on its problem description. The goal is to print "True" if the program meets the requirements perfectly, and "False" otherwise. Even partial correctness means it's incorrect. I need to be thorough and consider all possible edge cases to ensure the program works as expected.

First, I need to understand the problem description completely. It's about a card game between me and Nene. There are 2n cards, each with an integer from 1 to n, and each integer appears exactly twice. The deck is divided equally between me and Nene, so each gets n cards.

The game proceeds with 2n turns, alternating between me and Nene, starting with me. Each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, reveals its number x, and checks if there's already a card with number x on the table. If there is, the player gets a point. Then, the selected card is placed on the table.

Nene is smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and among optimal moves, she chooses the one that minimizes my score. My task is to figure out the maximum number of points I can get by playing optimally, given my hand of cards.

Now, looking at the provided program, it seems quite straightforward. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the list of integers in my hand. It counts the frequency of each number in my hand and calculates the answer as the sum of (x - 1) for each x in the frequency count, where x is the count of each number in my hand.

Wait a minute, that seems too simplistic. Let's see.

In the first test case of the example:

n = 4

a = [1, 1, 2, 3]

The program would count the frequency:

1 appears twice

2 appears once

3 appears once

4 appears zero times (since 4 is not in my hand)

Then, ans = max(0, 2-1) + max(0, 1-1) + max(0, 1-1) + max(0, 0-1) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1

Which matches the sample output of 1.

In the second test case:

n = 8

a = [7, 4, 1, 2, 8, 8, 5, 5]

Frequency:

1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 5:2, 7:1, 8:2, (3:0, 6:0)

ans = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2

Which matches the sample explanation of scoring 2 points.

Similarly, checking the other test cases, the program seems to produce the correct output.

But is this logic sound? Let's delve deeper.

The program is essentially counting how many pairs of cards I have in my hand and summing up the excess cards beyond the first one for each number.

Wait, but in the game, the sequence of moves matters because of how Nene plays optimally against me.

Let's think about how the game progresses.

Each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck. So, for each number, there are two cards: one with me and one with Nene, or both with me, or both with Nene.

But in the problem, it's guaranteed that each number appears at most twice in my hand, so:

- If I have two cards of the same number, Nene has none of that number.

- If I have one card of a number, Nene has one card of that number.

- If I have zero cards of a number, Nene has two cards of that number.

Now, the scoring happens based on whether the number is already on the table when you play a card.

So, to maximize my score, I want to play my cards in such a way that I get points as much as possible.

Nene, being smart, will play to maximize her score and minimize mine.

The program's logic seems to be that for each number that I have two cards of, I can get one point from the second card, because by the time I play the second card, Nene would have already played her card (if she has one), or I can pair it with my first card.

Wait, but in the first test case, I have two 1's, and Nene has two 2's and two 3's, but only one 4.

Wait, no. Wait, n=4, so numbers are from 1 to 4, each appearing twice.

Given my hand: 1,1,2,3, then Nene's hand must be 2,3,4,4.

So, in this case:

- I have two 1's, one 2, one 3.

- Nene has one 2, one 3, two 4's.

The program calculates ans as the sum of (x-1) for each x in my frequency count, where x is the count of each number in my hand.

So, for 1:2 -> 1, for 2:1 ->0, for 3:1 ->0, for 4:0 ->0, total 1.

This seems to suggest that for each pair I have, I can get one point.

But is this always correct?

Let me think about the game progression.

Since Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, she will consider the current state of the table.

Suppose I play a card with number x.

- If x is already on the table, I get a point.

- Then, I place my card on the table.

Nene will do the same.

So, the order in which we play the cards matters.

The program seems to ignore the ordering and just count the number of pairs I have.

Is this always sufficient?

Let's consider a simple case:

n=2

My hand: 1,1

Nene's hand: 2,2

Possible game progression:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0 points.

2. Nene plays 2, table: [1,2], Nene gets 0 points.

3. I play 1, table: [1,2,1], I get 1 point (since 1 is already on the table).

4. Nene plays 2, table: [1,2,1,2], Nene gets 1 point.

Total: I get 1 point, Nene gets 1 point.

Alternatively:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0 points.

2. Nene plays 2, table: [1,2], Nene gets 0 points.

3. I play 1, table: [1,2,1], I get 1 point.

4. Nene plays 2, table: [1,2,1,2], Nene gets 1 point.

Still, I get 1 point.

According to the program: cnt[1]=2, cnt[2]=0

ans = (2-1) + max(0,0-1) = 1 + 0 = 1

So, it matches.

Another case:

n=3

My hand: 1,2,3

Nene's hand: 1,2,3

Possible game progression:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0 points.

2. Nene plays 1, table: [1,1], Nene gets 1 point.

3. I play 2, table: [1,1,2], I get 0 points.

4. Nene plays 2, table: [1,1,2,2], Nene gets 1 point.

5. I play 3, table: [1,1,2,2,3], I get 0 points.

6. Nene plays 3, table: [1,1,2,2,3,3], Nene gets 1 point.

Total: I get 0 points, Nene gets 3 points.

According to the program: cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1

ans = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

Matches.

Another case:

n=3

My hand: 1,1,2

Nene's hand: 2,3,3

Possible game progression:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0 points.

2. Nene plays 2, table: [1,2], Nene gets 0 points.

3. I play 1, table: [1,2,1], I get 1 point.

4. Nene plays 3, table: [1,2,1,3], Nene gets 0 points.

5. I play 2, table: [1,2,1,3,2], I get 1 point.

6. Nene plays 3, table: [1,2,1,3,2,3], Nene gets 1 point.

Total: I get 2 points, Nene gets 1 point.

Wait, according to the program:

cnt[1]=2, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=0

ans = (2-1) + max(0,1-1) + max(0,0-1) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1

But in this game progression, I got 2 points. So, does that mean the program is incorrect?

Wait, but is there a way Nene can play to minimize my score?

Alternative game progression:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0 points.

2. Nene plays 3, table: [1,3], Nene gets 0 points.

3. I play 1, table: [1,3,1], I get 1 point.

4. Nene plays 2, table: [1,3,1,2], Nene gets 0 points.

5. I play 2, table: [1,3,1,2,2], I get 1 point.

6. Nene plays 3, table: [1,3,1,2,2,3], Nene gets 1 point.

Total: I get 2 points again.

Is there a way for Nene to reduce my score to 1?

Let's try:

1. I play 2, table: [2], I get 0 points.

2. Nene plays 2, table: [2,2], Nene gets 1 point.

3. I play 1, table: [2,2,1], I get 0 points.

4. Nene plays 3, table: [2,2,1,3], Nene gets 0 points.

5. I play 1, table: [2,2,1,3,1], I get 1 point.

6. Nene plays 3, table: [2,2,1,3,1,3], Nene gets 1 point.

Total: I get 1 point.

So, in this case, I can get either 1 or 2 points depending on the order I play my cards.

But according to the program, it outputs 1, which matches one of the possible outcomes.

But the problem asks for the maximum number of points I can get by playing optimally, assuming Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

In the first scenario, I got 2 points, but Nene could have played differently to minimize my score to 1.

In the second scenario, I got 1 point.

So, the optimal play for me would be to get 1 point in this case.

Hence, the program outputting 1 is correct.

Wait, but in the first scenario, I got 2 points, but that might not be possible if Nene plays optimally.

Wait, perhaps Nene can always force my score to be 1 in this case.

So, the program seems to be calculating the minimal possible score I can get, given Nene's optimal play.

Wait, no, it's supposed to calculate the maximum I can get, assuming I play optimally.

But in reality, Nene can force my score to be 1 in this case.

Hence, the program is correct.

Another test case:

n=1

My hand: [1]

Nene's hand: [1]

Only one number, both have one card.

Game progression:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0 points.

2. Nene plays 1, table: [1,1], Nene gets 1 point.

Total: I get 0 points.

According to the program:

cnt[1]=1

ans = max(0,1-1) = 0

Matches.

Another test case:

n=2

My hand: [1,2]

Nene's hand: [1,2]

Possible game progression:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0 points.

2. Nene plays 1, table: [1,1], Nene gets 1 point.

3. I play 2, table: [1,1,2], I get 0 points.

4. Nene plays 2, table: [1,1,2,2], Nene gets 1 point.

Total: I get 0 points.

Alternative progression:

1. I play 2, table: [2], I get 0 points.

2. Nene plays 1, table: [2,1], Nene gets 0 points.

3. I play 1, table: [2,1,1], I get 1 point.

4. Nene plays 2, table: [2,1,1,2], Nene gets 1 point.

Total: I get 1 point.

So, I can get either 0 or 1 points depending on how I play.

But Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

In the first progression, I get 0 points.

In the second, I get 1 point.

So, Nene would choose the first progression to minimize my score.

Hence, the optimal score I can get is 0.

According to the program:

cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1

ans = 0 + 0 = 0

Matches.

Another test case:

n=3

My hand: [1,1,3]

Nene's hand: [2,2,3]

Possible game progression:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0 points.

2. Nene plays 2, table: [1,2], Nene gets 0 points.

3. I play 1, table: [1,2,1], I get 1 point.

4. Nene plays 2, table: [1,2,1,2], Nene gets 1 point.

5. I play 3, table: [1,2,1,2,3], I get 0 points.

6. Nene plays 3, table: [1,2,1,2,3,3], Nene gets 1 point.

Total: I get 1 point.

Alternative progression:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0 points.

2. Nene plays 3, table: [1,3], Nene gets 0 points.

3. I play 1, table: [1,3,1], I get 1 point.

4. Nene plays 2, table: [1,3,1,2], Nene gets 0 points.

5. I play 3, table: [1,3,1,2,3], I get 1 point.

6. Nene plays 2, table: [1,3,1,2,3,2], Nene gets 1 point.

Total: I get 2 points.

But Nene would prefer to minimize my score, so she would choose the first progression where I get only 1 point.

According to the program:

cnt[1]=2, cnt[3]=1

ans = (2-1) + max(0,1-1) = 1 + 0 = 1

Matches.

Seems correct.

Wait, but in the alternative progression, I got 2 points. However, since Nene plays optimally to minimize my score, she would prevent me from achieving that higher score.

Hence, the program is correctly calculating the minimal score I can get, given Nene's optimal play.

Wait, no. The problem is to find the maximum number of points I can get by playing optimally, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, in the above case, even though there's a way for me to get 2 points, Nene can prevent that by playing optimally, so the maximum I can guarantee is 1 point.

Hence, the program is correct.

Let's consider another test case.

n=5

My hand: [1,1,2,3,4]

Nene's hand: [2,3,4,5,5]

According to the program:

cnt[1]=2, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1, cnt[4]=1, cnt[5]=0

ans = (2-1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1

Is this correct?

Possible game progression:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0 points.

2. Nene plays 2, table: [1,2], Nene gets 0 points.

3. I play 1, table: [1,2,1], I get 1 point.

4. Nene plays 3, table: [1,2,1,3], Nene gets 0 points.

5. I play 2, table: [1,2,1,3,2], I get 1 point.

6. Nene plays 4, table: [1,2,1,3,2,4], Nene gets 0 points.

7. I play 3, table: [1,2,1,3,2,4,3], I get 1 point.

8. Nene plays 4, table: [1,2,1,3,2,4,3,4], Nene gets 1 point.

9. I play 4, table: [1,2,1,3,2,4,3,4,4], I get 1 point.

10. Nene plays 5, table: [1,2,1,3,2,4,3,4,4,5], Nene gets 0 points.

Total: I get 3 points.

But according to the program, it should be 1.

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Let's see:

- In step 1: I play 1, table: [1], I get 0.

- Step 2: Nene plays 2, table: [1,2], Nene gets 0.

- Step 3: I play 1, table: [1,2,1], I get 1 point (since 1 is already on the table).

- Step 4: Nene plays 3, table: [1,2,1,3], Nene gets 0.

- Step 5: I play 2, table: [1,2,1,3,2], I get 1 point (since 2 is already on the table).

- Step 6: Nene plays 4, table: [1,2,1,3,2,4], Nene gets 0.

- Step 7: I play 3, table: [1,2,1,3,2,4,3], I get 1 point (since 3 is already on the table).

- Step 8: Nene plays 4, table: [1,2,1,3,2,4,3,4], Nene gets 1 point.

- Step 9: I play 4, table: [1,2,1,3,2,4,3,4,4], I get 1 point (since 4 is already on the table).

- Step 10: Nene plays 5, table: [1,2,1,3,2,4,3,4,4,5], Nene gets 0.

Total: I get 3 points.

But according to the program, it should be 1.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe Nene can play differently to minimize my score.

Alternative progression:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0.

2. Nene plays 5, table: [1,5], Nene gets 0.

3. I play 1, table: [1,5,1], I get 1.

4. Nene plays 2, table: [1,5,1,2], Nene gets 0.

5. I play 2, table: [1,5,1,2,2], I get 1.

6. Nene plays 3, table: [1,5,1,2,2,3], Nene gets 0.

7. I play 3, table: [1,5,1,2,2,3,3], I get 1.

8. Nene plays 4, table: [1,5,1,2,2,3,3,4], Nene gets 0.

9. I play 4, table: [1,5,1,2,2,3,3,4,4], I get 1.

10. Nene plays 4, table: [1,5,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4], Nene gets 1.

Total: I get 3 points again.

Wait, but according to the program, it should be 1.

Is there a way for Nene to minimize my score to 1?

Let's try:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0.

2. Nene plays 2, table: [1,2], Nene gets 0.

3. I play 1, table: [1,2,1], I get 1.

4. Nene plays 3, table: [1,2,1,3], Nene gets 0.

5. I play 4, table: [1,2,1,3,4], I get 0.

6. Nene plays 4, table: [1,2,1,3,4,4], Nene gets 1.

7. I play 2, table: [1,2,1,3,4,4,2], I get 1.

8. Nene plays 3, table: [1,2,1,3,4,4,2,3], Nene gets 1.

9. I play 3, table: [1,2,1,3,4,4,2,3,3], I get 1.

10. Nene plays 5, table: [1,2,1,3,4,4,2,3,3,5], Nene gets 0.

Total: I get 3 points again.

It seems no matter what Nene does, I can get at least 1 point, but potentially more.

So, why does the program output 1 in this case?

Is it because Nene can force my score to be 1, but in practice, it's higher?

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let's consider that Nene not only plays to maximize her score but also to minimize mine, given that she has multiple options.

In the first progression, I get 3 points, which seems higher than the program's output of 1.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the program is calculating the minimal guaranteed score I can get, assuming Nene plays to minimize it.

But the problem asks for the maximum score I can get by playing optimally, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, in the above case, even though I can get up to 3 points in some playthroughs, Nene can force my score to be only 1.

Hence, the program is correctly calculating the minimal score I can guarantee.

But in the earlier case where n=3, my hand is [1,1,3], Nene's hand is [2,2,3], the program outputs 1, which matches the minimal score I can get.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

Wait, but in the example where n=4, my hand is [1,1,2,3], Nene's hand is [2,3,4,4], the program outputs 1, which matches the sample output.

Hence, it seems correct.

But in the above case with n=5, my hand is [1,1,2,3,4], Nene's hand is [2,3,4,5,5], the program outputs 1, but I found a way to get 3 points.

Is there a way for Nene to prevent me from getting more than 1 point?

Let's try:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0.

2. Nene plays 5, table: [1,5], Nene gets 0.

3. I play 1, table: [1,5,1], I get 1.

4. Nene plays 5, table: [1,5,1,5], Nene gets 1.

5. I play 2, table: [1,5,1,5,2], I get 0.

6. Nene plays 2, table: [1,5,1,5,2,2], Nene gets 1.

7. I play 3, table: [1,5,1,5,2,2,3], I get 0.

8. Nene plays 3, table: [1,5,1,5,2,2,3,3], Nene gets 1.

9. I play 4, table: [1,5,1,5,2,2,3,3,4], I get 0.

10. Nene plays 4, table: [1,5,1,5,2,2,3,3,4,4], Nene gets 1.

Total: I get only 1 point.

So, in this case, Nene can force my score to be 1 by playing her second 5 after my first 1, and then playing her 2,3,4 accordingly.

Hence, the program is correct in outputting 1.

So, in this scenario, Nene can indeed minimize my score to 1.

Therefore, the program is correct.

So, the logic seems to be that for each pair I have, I can guarantee at least one point from it, but Nene can prevent me from getting more points from other cards.

Hence, the program is summing up the number of pairs I have, which seems to be the minimal score I can guarantee.

But in the problem, it's about maximizing my score assuming Nene plays optimally.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of graph theory or some pairing mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of duplicates I have in my hand.

Wait, perhaps the program is correct because for each number that appears twice in my hand, I can guarantee one point from it, regardless of how Nene plays.

Because, I can play the first card, and then play the second card when Nene hasn't played her card yet.

Wait, but in reality, Nene can play her card in between to minimize my points.

But in the earlier case, I saw that I can get more points, but Nene can force it to be only 1.

Hence, perhaps the program is correct in outputting the minimal guaranteed score.

But the problem is to find the maximum score I can get assuming I play optimally.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in all the test cases I tried, the program's output matches the minimal score Nene can force me to get.

But the problem is to find the maximum score I can get assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Hence, perhaps the program is correct in outputting the minimal score I can guarantee.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look up the concept of minimax in game theory.

In game theory, the minimax algorithm is a decision rule used in decision-making and game theory to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario.

In this problem, I need to maximize my score, assuming Nene is playing to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, it's a zero-sum game, and I need to find the optimal strategy assuming Nene is playing optimally against me.

Hence, it's a minimax problem where I need to maximize my score considering that Nene will minimize it.

The program seems to be calculating the number of pairs I have in my hand, and for each pair, I can get at least one point.

In the earlier case with n=5, my hand is [1,1,2,3,4], which has one pair (1,1), so the program outputs 1.

Even though in some playthroughs I can get more points, Nene can force my score to be only 1.

Hence, the program is correct in outputting 1, as that's the minimal score I can guarantee.

But in the problem, it's about the maximum score I can get assuming I play optimally.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the examples, it matches.

In the first test case, n=4, my hand=[1,1,2,3], program outputs 1, which matches the sample explanation.

In the second test case, n=8, my hand=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], program outputs 2, which matches the sample explanation.

Hence, perhaps the program is correct.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.

Let me read the problem again.

"The maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally."

Assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

Hence, it's about finding the optimal strategy for both players.

But in the program, it's simply counting the number of pairs I have in my hand and summing up (x-1) for each x in the frequency count where x >=2.

Which is equivalent to counting the number of pairs I have.

In the earlier case with n=5, my hand=[1,1,2,3,4], which has one pair, so program outputs 1.

In another case with n=3, my hand=[1,1,3], which has one pair, program outputs 1.

In the case with n=2, my hand=[1,2], which has no pairs, program outputs 0.

In the case with n=3, my hand=[1,1,2], which has one pair, program outputs 1.

Hence, it seems consistent.

But I need to confirm if this logic is correct.

Let me think about another test case.

n=4

My hand: [1,1,2,2]

Nene's hand: [3,3,4,4]

In this case, I have two pairs: two 1's and two 2's.

According to the program:

cnt[1]=2, cnt[2]=2, cnt[3]=0, cnt=4=0

ans = (2-1) + (2-1) + 0 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 2

Possible game progression:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0.

2. Nene plays 3, table: [1,3], Nene gets 0.

3. I play 1, table: [1,3,1], I get 1.

4. Nene plays 3, table: [1,3,1,3], Nene gets 1.

5. I play 2, table: [1,3,1,3,2], I get 0.

6. Nene plays 4, table: [1,3,1,3,2,4], Nene gets 0.

7. I play 2, table: [1,3,1,3,2,4,2], I get 1.

8. Nene plays 4, table: [1,3,1,3,2,4,2,4], Nene gets 1.

Total: I get 2 points.

Alternative progression:

1. I play 2, table: [2], I get 0.

2. Nene plays 3, table: [2,3], Nene gets 0.

3. I play 2, table: [2,3,2], I get 1.

4. Nene plays 3, table: [2,3,2,3], Nene gets 1.

5. I play 1, table: [2,3,2,3,1], I get 0.

6. Nene plays 4, table: [2,3,2,3,1,4], Nene gets 0.

7. I play 1, table: [2,3,2,3,1,4,1], I get 1.

8. Nene plays 4, table: [2,3,2,3,1,4,1,4], Nene gets 1.

Total: I get 2 points.

Another progression:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0.

2. Nene plays 4, table: [1,4], Nene gets 0.

3. I play 1, table: [1,4,1], I get 1.

4. Nene plays 3, table: [1,4,1,3], Nene gets 0.

5. I play 2, table: [1,4,1,3,2], I get 0.

6. Nene plays 3, table: [1,4,1,3,2,3], Nene gets 1.

7. I play 2, table: [1,4,1,3,2,3,2], I get 1.

8. Nene plays 4, table: [1,4,1,3,2,3,2,4], Nene gets 1.

Total: I get 2 points.

So, in all these progressions, I get 2 points, which matches the program's output.

Hence, in this case, I can guarantee 2 points, and Nene cannot force my score below that.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Another test case:

n=3

My hand: [1,1,2]

Nene's hand: [2,3,3]

According to the program:

cnt[1]=2, cnt[2]=1, cnt=3=0

ans = (2-1) + max(0,1-1) + max(0,0-1) = 1 + 0 + 0 =1

Possible game progression:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0.

2. Nene plays 2, table: [1,2], Nene gets 0.

3. I play 1, table: [1,2,1], I get 1.

4. Nene plays 3, table: [1,2,1,3], Nene gets 0.

5. I play 2, table: [1,2,1,3,2], I get 1.

6. Nene plays 3, table: [1,2,1,3,2,3], Nene gets 1.

Total: I get 2 points.

Alternative progression:

1. I play 1, table: [1], I get 0.

2. Nene plays 3, table: [1,3], Nene gets 0.

3. I play 1, table: [1,3,1], I get 1.

4. Nene plays 3, table: [1,3,1,3], Nene gets 1.

5. I play 2, table: [1,3,1,3,2], I get 0.

6. Nene plays 2, table: [1,3,1,3,2,2], Nene gets 1.

Total: I get 1 point.

So, Nene can force my score to be 1.

Hence, the program is correctly outputting 1, which is the minimal score I can guarantee.

But in one scenario, I can get 2 points, but Nene can force it to be 1.

Hence, the program is correct in outputting 1.

Hence, the program is correct.

I think I have verified enough test cases and the program seems to be working correctly.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points we can get in a card game against Nene, given that both players play optimally. 

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We and Nene each have `n` cards with integers from 1 to `n`, each integer appearing exactly twice.
   - We take turns placing one card at a time on the table. If the table already has a card with the same number, the player gets a point.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize ours.

2. **Insight**:
   - For each number that appears twice in our hand, we can ensure getting one point from it.
   - For numbers that appear only once in our hand, Nene can control when we play them to minimize our points.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Count how many numbers appear twice in our hand.
   - For each pair of identical numbers in our hand, we can guarantee one point.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - Read the input values.
   - Count the frequency of each number in our hand.
   - For each number that appears more than once in our hand, add the excess count minus one to the answer.

### Solution Code

```python
import sys

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        ans = 0
        for x in cnt:
            ans += max(0, x - 1)
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` and the list of integers in our hand.

2. **Frequency Count**:
   - Use a list `cnt` to count occurrences of each integer in our hand.

3. **Calculate Points**:
   - For each integer that appears more than once in our hand, add `(count - 1)` to the answer.
   - This ensures we account for pairs correctly.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Print the computed answer for each test case.

This approach ensures that we maximize our score given Nene's optimal play, by focusing on the pairs we hold, which are the key to scoring points.
