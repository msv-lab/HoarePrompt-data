Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The goal is to determine whether the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. If it does, I need to print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that partial correctness isn't acceptable; the program must handle every potential case as described.

I've been given three examples to help me understand the task better. Let's look at those first.

**Example 1:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to identify non-prime numbers.

- Program: A function that checks if a number is not prime by iterating from 2 to n-1 and checking for factors.

- Example Answer: Correctness: **True**

This seems straightforward. The function correctly identifies non-prime numbers by checking for factors other than 1 and itself.

**Example 2:**

- Problem Description: Write a Python function to count all substrings starting and ending with the same character.

- Program: A double loop that checks if s[i] == s[j+1] and counts such instances.

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**

I need to think about why this might be incorrect. Perhaps there are edge cases where the program doesn't count correctly, like when all characters are the same or for empty strings. Maybe it doesn't handle overlapping substrings properly.

**Example 3:**

- Problem Description: Write a function to perform binary search on a list.

- Program: A binary search implementation that seems to have an issue with how it updates the 'left' and 'right' indices.

- Example Answer: Correctness: **False**

In binary search, it's crucial to handle the mid-index correctly to converge on the target value. The way 'left' and 'right' are updated might be flawed, leading to infinite loops or incorrect results.

From these examples, I understand that I need to be thorough in my analysis, considering all possible edge cases and ensuring the program behaves as expected in every scenario.

Now, moving on to my task:

**Problem Description:**

- There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends, each with a friendship value f_i.

- The teacher goes on k excursions, choosing a pair of children randomly, equiprobably, and independently each time.

- If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

- Friendship values of non-friend pairs are 0 and never change.

- Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions (at the time of being chosen).

- Output this expected value modulo 10^9+7, expressed as p * q^{-1} mod (10^9+7), where p and q are coprime.

**Program Code:**

```python
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
    return result % MOD

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)
```

First, I need to understand what the program is doing and compare it to what the problem requires.

**Analysis:**

1. **Problem Understanding:**

- We have n children, m friend pairs with initial friendship values f_i.

- Over k excursions, a pair is chosen randomly each time.

- If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

- We need the expected sum of friendship values at the time of choice over k excursions.

2. **Key Points:**

- Pairs are chosen randomly and independently.

- Only friend pairs' friendship values increase over time.

- Non-friend pairs have a friendship value of 0, which never changes.

- We need the expected sum of the friendship values at the time of choice for each of the k choices.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**

- For each friend pair (a, b), their friendship value starts at f_i and increases by 1 for each time they are chosen in previous excursions.

- Since choices are independent, the expected value for each choice is the same.

- However, because the friendship values can increase based on previous choices, this introduces dependency.

- But the problem specifies that the choices are independent, which suggests that perhaps the friendship value increase applies only to future choices, not past ones. This needs clarification.

Wait, the problem says: "If a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions."

So, the friendship value increases after being chosen, affecting future excursions, but not the current one.

- Therefore, for each excursion, the friendship value of a pair at the time of choice is f_i plus the number of times they have been chosen in previous excursions.

- But since choices are independent, the history of choices affects the current value.

This seems complex. Maybe I need to think differently.

4. **Simplifying the Problem:**

- Let's consider that for each excursion, the friendship value of a pair at the time of choice is f_i plus the number of times they have been chosen in previous excursions.

- But because choices are independent, the expected value for each choice is the same.

- Wait, but the friendship value can increase based on previous choices, which complicates things.

- Perhaps I need to model this as a series of expected values, considering the probability of choosing each pair and how that affects future choices.

This seems too involved. Maybe there's a smarter way.

5. **Looking at the Provided Program:**

- The program defines func_1, which takes n, m, k, and friendships.

- It initializes result to 0.

- For each friendship, it adds f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD to result.

- Finally, it returns result % MOD.

- func_2 reads input for multiple test cases and calls func_1 for each.

6. **Evaluating the Program:**

- The program seems to calculate the sum of f_i multiplied by some function of k.

- Specifically, it multiplies f_i by k*(k+1)/2, which is the sum of the first k natural numbers.

- But according to the problem, the friendship value increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen, for subsequent choices.

- This suggests that the program might be incorrectly assuming that each f_i is increased by the sum of the first k natural numbers.

- This doesn't align with the problem's description of how friendship values increase.

Let me think differently.

7. **Correct Approach:**

- Each excursion chooses a pair randomly and independently.

- For each chosen pair, if they are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

- We need the expected sum of the friendship values at the time of choice for each of the k choices.

- Since choices are independent, the expected value for each choice is the same, but the friendship values can change based on previous choices.

- This seems like a scenario where we need to compute the expected value considering the dependencies between excursions.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different way to model this.

8. **Alternative Perspective:**

- Let's consider that for each friend pair, their contribution to the total sum is their friendship value at the time of choice, plus any increases due to previous selections.

- But given the independence of choices, perhaps there's a way to compute the expected value without considering the sequence of selections.

- Maybe using linearity of expectation could simplify this.

Let me consider linearity of expectation.

9. **Linearity of Expectation:**

- The expected sum is the sum of the expected values for each excursion.

- For each excursion, the expected friendship value is the sum over all friend pairs of their friendship value at that time, multiplied by the probability of choosing that pair.

- Since pairs are chosen uniformly at random, the probability of choosing any specific pair is 1/C(n,2), where C(n,2) is the number of possible pairs.

- However, friendship values can increase over time based on previous choices, which complicates the calculation.

This seems too intertwined to handle directly.

10. **Revisiting the Program's Logic:**

- The program multiplies each f_i by k*(k+1)/2.

- This suggests that it's assuming each f_i contributes f_i * (1 + 2 + ... + k) to the total sum.

- But according to the problem, the friendship value increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen, for subsequent choices, not for the current choice.

- Therefore, the program's logic seems flawed.

Let me try to think of a specific example to see if the program works.

11. **Example Analysis:**

Take the second example from the input:

- n=2, m=1, k=10

- Friend pair: 1 and 2 with f=1

- According to the problem, each time this pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for subsequent choices.

- So, for each choice, their friendship value at the time of choice is f + number of times they have been chosen before.

- Since choices are independent, the expected value for each choice is the same.

- In this case, the output is 55, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55.

- This matches the program's output, as func_1 would compute 1 * (10 * 11 / 2) = 55.

- But is this correct?

Wait, according to the problem, when a pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent choices, but not for the current choice.

So, in the first choice, the friendship value is 1.

If they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for the next choice.

But in the second choice, their friendship value is now 2, if they were chosen in the first choice.

But choices are independent, so the friendship value for each choice depends on how many times they have been chosen in previous choices.

This is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I need to accept that for this specific case, the program gives the correct answer, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's correct in general.

Let's consider another example.

12. **Another Example:**

Consider n=3, m=1, k=2

- Friend pair: 1 and 2 with f=1

- Total possible pairs: 3 (1-2, 1-3, 2-3)

- Probability of choosing the friend pair in any excursion: 1/3

- For the first excursion, the friendship value is 1.

- If chosen, their friendship value becomes 2 for the second excursion.

- If not chosen in the first, it remains 1 for the second excursion.

- Expected friendship value for the first excursion: 1 (since it's the first choice)

- Expected friendship value for the second excursion: (1/3)*2 + (2/3)*1 = 4/3

- Total expected sum: 1 + 4/3 = 7/3

- According to the program: func_1(3,1,2,[(1,2,1)]) = 1 * (2*3/2) = 3

- But according to our calculation, it should be 7/3.

- Clearly, 3 ≠ 7/3, so the program is incorrect in this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**

The program is incorrect because it does not accurately calculate the expected sum of friendship values as described in the problem. The example above demonstrates a case where the program's output differs from the correct expected value.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
