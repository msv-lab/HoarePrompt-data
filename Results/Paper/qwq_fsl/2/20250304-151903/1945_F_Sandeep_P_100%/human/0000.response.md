Correctness: **True**

## Explanation

The provided program aims to solve a problem where we need to maximize the strength of an elixir made from mushrooms, given certain constraints. The strength of the elixir is defined as the product of the number of mushrooms used and the minimum magic power among those mushrooms. There is a permutation that affects the magic powers of the mushrooms based on the number of mushrooms picked.

### Approach

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of mushrooms, their magic powers, and the permutation.

2. **Using a SortedList**:
   - Use a `SortedList` to maintain the magic powers of the mushrooms in sorted order.
   - This allows efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup of mushroom magic powers.

3. **Simulating the Process**:
   - For each possible number of mushrooms picked (from 1 to n), calculate the potential strength of the elixir.
   - Adjust the sorted list by removing the magic power of the mushroom specified by the permutation for the current number of mushrooms picked.
   - Track the maximum strength found and the corresponding number of mushrooms.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Print the maximum strength and the minimum number of mushrooms that achieve this strength.

### Solution Code

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        sl = SortedList(a)
        ans = 0
        score = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if len(sl) < i:
                break
            cur = i * sl[-i]
            if cur > score:
                score = cur
                ans = i
            sl.discard(a[b[i - 1] - 1])
        print(score, ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - We read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, we read `n` (number of mushrooms), the list `a` of magic powers, and the permutation `b`.

2. **Using a SortedList**:
   - We create a `SortedList` from `a`, which keeps the magic powers sorted.

3. **Simulating the Process**:
   - We iterate over the number of mushrooms picked from 1 to n.
   - For each `i`, we calculate the strength as `i * sl[-i]`, which is the product of the number of mushrooms and the smallest magic power among the remaining mushrooms.
   - If this strength is greater than the current maximum, we update the maximum strength and the corresponding number of mushrooms.
   - After considering `i` mushrooms, we remove the magic power of the mushroom specified by the permutation `b[i-1]` from the sorted list.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - We print the maximum strength and the number of mushrooms that achieve this strength for each test case.

This approach ensures that we efficiently manage the sorted list and handle the permutation constraints correctly, achieving the desired result for each test case.
