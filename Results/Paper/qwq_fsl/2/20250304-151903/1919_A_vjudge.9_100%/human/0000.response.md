Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every possible case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I need to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

Let's start by understanding the problem and the program provided.

### Problem Description

Alice and Bob are playing a game with their wallets. Alice has `a` coins, and Bob has `b` coins. They take turns, with Alice starting first. In each turn, a player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep the current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. Both play optimally.

### Program

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Analysis

First, I need to understand the logic behind the program. The program reads multiple test cases, each with two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively. It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. If it is, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, "Alice".

So, the core logic seems to be that if the difference between `a` and `b` is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

### Step-by-Step Verification

1. **Understand the Game Mechanics:**
   - Players take turns, starting with Alice.
   - In each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or keep the current wallet, then remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game continues until a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet has 0 coins and they cannot swap to a non-empty wallet).

2. **Determine the Winning Strategy:**
   - Since both play optimally, we need to find a pattern or mathematical relationship that determines the winner based on the initial number of coins.

3. **Examine the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even.
   - If even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

4. **Verify with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - Input: `1 1`
     - Output: "Bob"
     - Explanation: Both have 1 coin. Alice starts and removes 1 coin, making both have 0 coins. Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins. But the program outputs "Bob", which seems incorrect.
   - **Example 2:**
     - Input: `1 4`
     - Output: "Alice"
     - Explanation: Alice can swap to have 4 coins, then Bob has 1 coin. Alice can make moves accordingly to force Bob to lose. The program outputs "Alice", which seems correct.
   - **Example 3:**
     - Input: `5 3`
     - Output: "Bob"
     - Explanation: Difference is 2, which is even. Program outputs "Bob".
   - **Example 4:**
     - Input: `4 5`
     - Output: "Alice"
     - Explanation: Difference is 1, which is odd. Program outputs "Alice".

From the first example, there seems to be a discrepancy. Let's dive deeper.

### Detailed Analysis of Example 1

- **Initial State:**
  - Alice: 1 coin
  - Bob: 1 coin

- **Alice's First Move:**
  - Option 1: Swap wallets. Now Alice has 1 coin, Bob has 1 coin. Alice removes 1 coin, so Alice has 0 coins.
  - Option 2: Keep wallet. Alice has 1 coin, removes 1 coin, so Alice has 0 coins.

- **Bob's Move:**
  - If Alice swapped, Bob has 1 coin. Bob can remove 1 coin, making Bob have 0 coins. Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins.
  - If Alice did not swap, Bob has 1 coin. Bob removes 1 coin, making Bob have 0 coins. Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins.

In both scenarios, Bob wins. But according to the program, if `a = 1` and `b = 1`, `abs(1 - 1) = 0`, which is even, so it prints "Bob", which matches the expected outcome. Wait, in my earlier thought process, I thought Alice would win, but actually, Bob wins in both scenarios. So maybe my initial thought was wrong.

### Another Test Case

Let's consider `a = 2`, `b = 2`.

- **Alice's First Move:**
  - Option 1: Swap wallets. Alice has 2 coins, Bob has 2 coins. Alice removes 1 coin, Alice has 1 coin.
  - Option 2: Keep wallet. Alice has 2 coins, removes 1 coin, Alice has 1 coin.

- **Bob's Move:**
  - If Alice swapped, Bob has 2 coins. Bob can swap or keep. If Bob swaps, Bob has 1 coin, removes 1 coin, Bob has 0 coins. Alice has 1 coin, removes 1 coin, Alice has 0 coins. No one can move, Bob wins.
  - If Bob keeps, Bob has 2 coins, removes 1 coin, Bob has 1 coin. Alice has 1 coin, removes 1 coin, Alice has 0 coins. Bob has 1 coin, removes 1 coin, Bob has 0 coins. No one can move, Bob wins.
  - If Alice didn't swap, similar logic applies.

Again, Bob wins, and `abs(2 - 2) = 0`, which is even, so program outputs "Bob", correct.

### Another Test Case

Let's consider `a = 2`, `b = 1`.

- **Alice's First Move:**
  - Option 1: Swap wallets. Alice has 1 coin, Bob has 2 coins. Alice removes 1 coin, Alice has 0 coins.
  - Option 2: Keep wallet. Alice has 2 coins, removes 1 coin, Alice has 1 coin.

- **Bob's Move:**
  - If Alice swapped:
    - Bob has 2 coins, can swap with Alice (0 coins) or keep.
    - If Bob swaps, Bob has 0 coins, cannot remove coin. So Alice wins.
  - If Alice kept:
    - Alice has 1 coin, Bob has 1 coin.
    - Bob can swap or keep.
    - If Bob swaps, Bob has 1 coin, removes 1 coin, Bob has 0 coins. Alice has 1 coin, removes 1 coin, Alice has 0 coins. No one can move, Bob wins.
    - If Bob keeps, Bob has 1 coin, removes 1 coin, Bob has 0 coins. Alice has 1 coin, removes 1 coin, Alice has 0 coins. No one can move, Bob wins.

So, if Alice chooses to swap, Alice can force her win, but since both play optimally, Alice would choose the option that leads to her win. So Alice chooses to swap, and she wins.

According to the program, `abs(2 - 1) = 1`, which is odd, so it prints "Alice", matching the expected outcome.

### General Pattern

From these examples, it seems that when the difference between `a` and `b` is even, Bob wins, and when it's odd, Alice wins.

Let's see if this holds for larger numbers.

### Test Case with Large Numbers

- **Input: `1000000000 1000000000`**
- **Output: "Bob"**
- **Difference: 0, which is even.**

According to the program, "Bob" wins, which seems correct based on earlier reasoning.

Another test case:

- **Input: `53110 2024`**
- **Difference: 53110 - 2024 = 51086, which is even.**
- **Output: "Bob"**

Seems correct.

### Edge Cases

1. **Both have 1 coin:**
   - Difference is 0, even -> "Bob" wins.
   - As seen earlier, Bob wins.

2. **One has 1 coin, the other has 0 coins:**
   - Wait, the problem states that both have at least 1 coin.

3. **Both have the same number of coins:**
   - Difference is 0, even -> "Bob" wins.

4. **One has one more coin than the other:**
   - Difference is 1, odd -> "Alice" wins.

### Conclusion

After testing multiple cases and analyzing the game's mechanics, it seems that the program's logic correctly determines the winner based on the difference between `a` and `b`. The key insight is that if the difference is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
