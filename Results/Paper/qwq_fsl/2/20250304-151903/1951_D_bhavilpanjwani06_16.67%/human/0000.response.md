Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. I need to determine if the program meets the requirements for every possible input case. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". I have to be thorough and consider all potential edge cases to ensure the program's correctness.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. Let's read the problem description carefully.

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Bob wants to set up at most 60 stalls, each with an integer price per jewel between 1 and 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order, buying as many jewels as possible with her remaining coins, until she has visited all stalls.

My task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and set their prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices; otherwise, "NO".

Now, looking at the provided program, it seems to handle the task differently. Let's see what the code does.

The code reads input for multiple test cases and processes each one with the function `func_1()`. In `func_1()`, it reads n and k, then checks a few conditions:

1. If n < k, it prints "NO". This makes sense because Alice cannot buy more jewels than the number of coins she has.

2. If n == k, it prints "YES", followed by 1 stall with price n. This means Alice buys one jewel at price n, which matches k.

3. If k - 1 < n - k + 1, it prints "YES", followed by 2 stalls: one with price n - k + 1 and another with price 1.

I'm a bit confused about the third condition. Let's try to understand what it's doing.

First, I need to make sure I understand the logic behind these conditions.

Case 1: n < k

- Impossible, since Alice can't buy more jewels than her coins.

Case 2: n == k

- Alice buys one jewel at price n.

Case 3: k - 1 < n - k + 1

- This seems unclear. Let's try to interpret it.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the condition is to check if k-1 < n - k +1, which simplifies to k-1 < n - k +1 => k -1 < n - k +1 => k -1 < n - k +1 => 2k -1 < n +1 => 2k < n +2 => 2k -2 < n.

Hmm, that seems convoluted. Maybe I should try specific examples to see if the code works.

Let's look at the examples provided in the problem.

Example 1:

Input:

7 3

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

Explanation:

Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall (7//2=3), but actually, according to the explanation, she buys 3 jewels at the first stall and is left with 1 coin, which isn't enough for any other stalls.

But according to the code, for n=7 and k=3:

Check if 7 < 3: No.

Check if 7 == 3: No.

Check if 3 -1 < 7 -3 +1 → 2 < 5: Yes.

So it prints YES with 2 stalls: prices n - k +1 = 7 -3 +1 = 5, and 1.

So stalls: 5 and 1.

Let's simulate Alice's buying:

- At stall 1 (price 5): She can buy 7 //5 =1 jewel, left with 7 -5 =2 coins.

- At stall 2 (price 1): She can buy 2 //1 =2 jewels, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels: 1 + 2 =3, which matches k=3.

So in this case, the code works correctly.

Wait, but in the example, they have 10 stalls with prices 2 through 11, and Alice buys 3 jewels. So another valid configuration exists, but the code chooses a different valid configuration with only 2 stalls.

That's fine, as long as the number of stalls is <=60 and the total jewels bought are k.

Example 2:

Input:

6 4

Output:

NO

According to the code:

n=6, k=4

Check if 6 < 4: No.

Check if 6 ==4: No.

Check if 4-1 < 6-4+1 → 3 < 3: No.

So it prints "NO", which matches the sample output.

Example 3:

Input:

255 8

Output:

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

According to the code:

n=255, k=8

Check if 255 <8: No.

Check if 255==8: No.

Check if 8-1 <255-8+1 →7 <255-8+1=248: Yes.

So it prints YES with 2 stalls: prices 255-8+1=248 and 1.

But in the sample, it shows 8 stalls with prices 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1, and Alice buys one jewel from each stall.

Total jewels:8, which matches.

But the code proposes only 2 stalls: 248 and 1.

Let's simulate:

- Stall 1 (248): 255//248=1 jewel, left with 255-248=7 coins.

- Stall 2 (1): 7//1=7 jewels, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels:1 +7=8, which matches k=8.

So, again, the code provides a valid configuration with only 2 stalls.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, so 2 is acceptable.

Now, I need to verify if the code always provides a correct configuration or if there are cases where it fails.

Let me think about different scenarios.

Case 1: n < k

- Code correctly prints "NO".

Case 2: n == k

- Code sets one stall with price n, so Alice buys one jewel, which equals k.

- Correct.

Case 3: k -1 < n - k +1

- Code sets two stalls: one with price p1 = n - k +1 and p2 =1.

- Alice buys floor(n/p1) jewels from the first stall, then floor(m/p2) from the second, where m is the remaining coins after the first stall.

- Need to ensure that the total jewels bought equal k.

Let me verify this.

Let’s denote:

j1 = floor(n / p1)

m = n - j1 * p1

j2 = floor(m / p2)

Total jewels: j1 + j2 = k

Given p1 = n - k +1

Let’s compute j1:

j1 = floor(n / (n - k +1))

Similarly, m = n - j1 * (n - k +1)

Then j2 = floor(m / 1) = m

So total jewels: j1 + m = j1 + n - j1 * p1

Substituting p1 = n - k +1:

Total jewels: j1 + n - j1*(n - k +1) = k

We need this to equal k.

Let’s see if this holds.

Let’s solve for j1:

j1 + n - j1*(n - k +1) = k

Rearrange:

n - j1*(n - k +1 -1) = k

Wait, let's rearrange properly:

j1 + n - j1*(n - k +1) = k

Factor j1:

j1 * (1 - (n - k +1)) + n = k

j1 * (1 - n + k -1) + n = k

Simplify:

j1 * (k - n) + n = k

Then:

j1 * (k - n) = k - n

So j1 = (k - n) / (k - n) =1, if k != n

But in our case, k != n, since n ==k is already handled.

So j1 should be 1, and m = n -1*(n -k +1) = n - n +k -1 =k -1

Then j2 = floor((k -1)/1) =k -1

Total jewels: j1 + j2 =1 + (k -1) =k

So it works.

Therefore, in this case, the code correctly sets up two stalls to achieve exactly k jewels.

Now, is there any case where this doesn't hold?

Let me think about n=1, k=1.

n=1, k=1:

n ==k, so it sets one stall with price 1.

Alice buys 1 jewel, which matches k.

Good.

n=1, k=2:

n <k, so "NO".

Correct.

n=2, k=1:

Check if 2 <1: No.

Check if 2==1: No.

Check if 1-1 <2-1+1 →0 <2: Yes.

So sets p1=2-1+1=2, p2=1.

Alice buys floor(2/2)=1 jewel from first stall, m=2-2=0.

Then second stall: 0/1=0 jewels.

Total jewels:1+0=1, which matches k=1.

Good.

n=3, k=2:

Check if 3<2: No.

Check if 3==2: No.

Check if 2-1 <3-2+1 →1 <2: Yes.

Set p1=3-2+1=2, p2=1.

Alice buys floor(3/2)=1 jewel, m=3-2=1.

Then floor(1/1)=1 jewel.

Total:1+1=2, matches k=2.

Good.

n=4, k=3:

Check if 4<3: No.

Check if 4==3: No.

Check if 3-1 <4-3+1 →2 <2: No.

So "NO".

Is this correct?

Let's see.

If Bob sets up stalls with any prices, can Alice buy exactly 3 jewels with 4 coins?

Let's try:

- Stall 1: price 1 → Alice buys 4 jewels. Total 4. Not 3.

- Stall 1: price 2 → buys 2 jewels, m=0. Total 2.

- Stall 2: price 1 → buys 0 jewels.

Total:2, not 3.

- Stall 1: price 3 → buys 1 jewel, m=1.

- Stall 2: price 1 → buys 1 jewel.

Total:2, not 3.

- Stall 1: price 4 → buys 1 jewel, m=0.

- Stall 2: price 1 → buys 0 jewels.

Total:1, not 3.

Seems impossible to get exactly 3 jewels with 4 coins.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Another case: n=5, k=2.

Check if 5<2: No.

Check if 5==2: No.

Check if 2-1 <5-2+1 →1 <4: Yes.

Set p1=5-2+1=4, p2=1.

Alice buys floor(5/4)=1 jewel, m=5-4=1.

Then floor(1/1)=1 jewel.

Total:1+1=2, which matches k=2.

Good.

Wait, but maybe there are other configurations.

For example, set p1=3, p2=1.

Alice buys floor(5/3)=1 jewel, m=5-3=2.

Then floor(2/1)=2 jewels.

Total:1+2=3, which is more than k=2.

So, in this case, with p1=3 and p2=1, Alice buys 3 jewels, which is more than k=2.

But the code sets p1=4 and p2=1, achieving exactly k=2.

So, the code's approach seems valid.

Now, is there any case where this approach fails?

Let me think about larger numbers.

n=100, k=10.

Check if 100<10: No.

Check if 100==10: No.

Check if 10-1 <100-10+1 →9 <91: Yes.

Set p1=100-10+1=91, p2=1.

Alice buys floor(100/91)=1 jewel, m=100-91=9.

Then floor(9/1)=9 jewels.

Total:1+9=10, which matches k=10.

Good.

Another case: n=10, k=5.

Check if 10<5: No.

Check if 10==5: No.

Check if 5-1 <10-5+1 →4 <6: Yes.

Set p1=10-5+1=6, p2=1.

Alice buys floor(10/6)=1 jewel, m=10-6=4.

Then floor(4/1)=4 jewels.

Total:1+4=5, matches k=5.

Good.

Wait, but what if n=5, k=3.

Check if 5<3: No.

Check if 5==3: No.

Check if 3-1 <5-3+1 →2 <3: Yes.

Set p1=5-3+1=3, p2=1.

Alice buys floor(5/3)=1 jewel, m=5-3=2.

Then floor(2/1)=2 jewels.

Total:1+2=3, matches k=3.

Good.

Another case: n=10, k=4.

Check if 10<4: No.

Check if 10==4: No.

Check if 4-1 <10-4+1 →3 <7: Yes.

Set p1=10-4+1=7, p2=1.

Alice buys floor(10/7)=1 jewel, m=10-7=3.

Then floor(3/1)=3 jewels.

Total:1+3=4, matches k=4.

Good.

Wait, but what if n=8, k=2.

Check if 8<2: No.

Check if 8==2: No.

Check if 2-1 <8-2+1 →1 <7: Yes.

Set p1=8-2+1=7, p2=1.

Alice buys floor(8/7)=1 jewel, m=8-7=1.

Then floor(1/1)=1 jewel.

Total:1+1=2, matches k=2.

Good.

Another case: n=9, k=3.

Check if 9<3: No.

Check if 9==3: No.

Check if 3-1 <9-3+1 →2 <7: Yes.

Set p1=9-3+1=7, p2=1.

Alice buys floor(9/7)=1 jewel, m=9-7=2.

Then floor(2/1)=2 jewels.

Total:1+2=3, matches k=3.

Good.

Wait, but what if n=6, k=3.

Check if 6<3: No.

Check if 6==3: No.

Check if 3-1 <6-3+1 →2 <4: Yes.

Set p1=6-3+1=4, p2=1.

Alice buys floor(6/4)=1 jewel, m=6-4=2.

Then floor(2/1)=2 jewels.

Total:1+2=3, matches k=3.

But in the second example of the problem, n=6 and k=4 is "NO".

Wait, but according to the code, for n=6 and k=4:

Check if 6<4: No.

Check if 6==4: No.

Check if 4-1 <6-4+1 →3 <3: No.

So it prints "NO", which matches the sample output.

Good.

So, in this case, the code correctly identifies it as "NO".

Now, is there any case where the code says "YES" but it should be "NO", or vice versa?

Let me think about n=1, k=1: Correct "YES".

n=1, k=2: Correct "NO".

n=2, k=1: Correct "YES".

n=2, k=2: Correct "YES".

n=3, k=1: Correct "YES".

n=3, k=2: Correct "YES".

n=3, k=3: Correct "YES".

n=4, k=1: Correct "YES".

n=4, k=2: Correct "YES".

n=4, k=3: Correct "NO".

n=4, k=4: Correct "YES".

n=5, k=1: Correct "YES".

n=5, k=2: Correct "YES".

n=5, k=3: Correct "YES".

n=5, k=4: Correct "NO".

n=5, k=5: Correct "YES".

Seems consistent.

Wait, n=5, k=3:

According to the code:

p1=5-3+1=3, p2=1.

Alice buys 1 jewel from p1 (5//3=1), m=5-3=2.

Then 2//1=2 jewels.

Total:1+2=3, matches k=3.

Good.

But what if k=4?

According to the code, it would go to the "else" clause and print "NO".

Is it possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with n=5 coins?

Let's try:

- Stall 1: price 1 → buys 5 jewels. Total 5 >4.

- Stall 1: price 2 → buys 2 jewels, m=1.

- Stall 2: price 1 → buys 1 jewel.

- Total:3, which is less than 4.

- Stall 1: price 3 → buys 1 jewel, m=2.

- Stall 2: price 2 → buys 1 jewel, m=0.

- Total:2, which is less than 4.

- Stall 1: price 4 → buys 1 jewel, m=1.

- Stall 2: price 1 → buys 1 jewel.

- Total:2, which is less than 4.

- Stall 1: price 5 → buys 1 jewel, m=0.

- Stall 2: price 1 → buys 0 jewels.

- Total:1, which is less than 4.

Seems impossible to get exactly 4 jewels with n=5 coins.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Another case: n=10, k=5.

According to the code:

p1=10-5+1=6, p2=1.

Alice buys 1 jewel from p1 (10//6=1), m=10-6=4.

Then 4//1=4 jewels.

Total:1+4=5, matches k=5.

Good.

But what if k=6?

According to the code, k-1=5 < n -k +1=10-6+1=5: 5 <5 is False, so "NO".

Is it possible to get exactly 6 jewels with n=10 coins?

Let's try:

- Stall 1: price 1 → buys 10 jewels. Total 10 >6.

- Stall 1: price 2 → buys 5 jewels, m=0.

- Total:5, which is less than 6.

- Stall 1: price 3 → buys 3 jewels, m=1.

- Stall 2: price 1 → buys 1 jewel.

- Total:4, which is less than 6.

- Stall 1: price 4 → buys 2 jewels, m=2.

- Stall 2: price 2 → buys 1 jewel, m=0.

- Total:3, which is less than 6.

- Stall 1: price 5 → buys 2 jewels, m=0.

- Total:2, which is less than 6.

- Stall 1: price 6 → buys 1 jewel, m=4.

- Stall 2: price 4 → buys 1 jewel, m=0.

- Total:2, which is less than 6.

Seems impossible to get exactly 6 jewels with n=10 coins.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Another case: n=15, k=10.

According to the code:

Check if 15 <10: No.

Check if 15==10: No.

Check if 10-1 <15-10+1 →9 <6: No.

So "NO".

Is it possible to get exactly 10 jewels with n=15 coins?

Let's try:

- Stall 1: price 1 → buys 15 jewels. Total 15 >10.

- Stall 1: price 2 → buys 7 jewels, m=1.

- Stall 2: price 1 → buys 1 jewel.

- Total:8, which is less than 10.

- Stall 1: price 3 → buys 5 jewels, m=0.

- Total:5, which is less than 10.

- Stall 1: price 4 → buys 3 jewels, m=3.

- Stall 2: price 3 → buys 1 jewel, m=0.

- Total:4, which is less than 10.

- Stall 1: price 5 → buys 3 jewels, m=0.

- Total:3, which is less than 10.

- Stall 1: price 6 → buys 2 jewels, m=3.

- Stall 2: price 3 → buys 1 jewel, m=0.

- Total:3, which is less than 10.

Seems impossible to get exactly 10 jewels with n=15 coins.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Now, is there any case where the code says "YES" but it shouldn't?

Let me think about n=1, k=1.

According to the code: n==k, so sets one stall with price 1.

Alice buys 1 jewel, which matches k=1.

Good.

n=2, k=1.

Sets p1=2-1+1=2, p2=1.

Alice buys 1 jewel from p1, m=0.

Total:1, matches k=1.

Good.

n=3, k=2.

Sets p1=3-2+1=2, p2=1.

Alice buys 1 jewel from p1, m=1.

Then 1 jewel from p2.

Total:2, matches k=2.

Good.

n=4, k=3.

According to the code: k-1=2 < n -k +1=4-3+1=2: 2 <2 is False, so "NO".

Correct, as we saw earlier.

n=5, k=4.

According to the code: k-1=3 < n -k +1=5-4+1=2: 3 <2 is False, so "NO".

Correct.

n=6, k=5.

According to the code: k-1=4 < n -k +1=6-5+1=2: 4 <2 is False, so "NO".

Correct.

n=7, k=6.

According to the code: k-1=5 < n -k +1=7-6+1=2: 5 <2 is False, so "NO".

Correct.

n=8, k=7.

k-1=6 <8-7+1=2: 6 <2 is False, so "NO".

Correct.

n=9, k=8.

k-1=7 <9-8+1=2: 7 <2 is False, so "NO".

Correct.

n=10, k=9.

k-1=8 <10-9+1=2: 8 <2 is False, so "NO".

Correct.

n=11, k=10.

k-1=9 <11-10+1=2: 9 <2 is False, so "NO".

Correct.

Now, what about n=1, k=1: Covered, correct.

n=2, k=1: Covered, correct.

n=2, k=2:

According to the code: n==k, so sets one stall with price 2.

Alice buys 1 jewel, which should be k=2.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, if n=2 and k=2, setting one stall with price 2, Alice buys 1 jewel, which is less than k=2.

Wait, that's incorrect.

But according to the code, in the case n==k, it sets one stall with price n.

But in this case, Alice would buy floor(n / n) =1 jewel, which is equal to k=2 only if n==k and n is divisible by the price.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me check.

For n=2, k=2:

Set one stall with price 2.

Alice buys 1 jewel, which is less than k=2.

So, it should be "NO", but according to the code, it sets one stall with price n when n==k.

But in this case, Alice buys only 1 jewel, which is less than k=2.

Wait, but according to the problem, if n==k, setting one stall with price 1 would allow Alice to buy k jewels.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my understanding.

Wait, if n==k, setting one stall with price 1, Alice would buy n /1 =n=k jewels.

Wait, but the code sets price n, so Alice buys 1 jewel.

That's a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the code
