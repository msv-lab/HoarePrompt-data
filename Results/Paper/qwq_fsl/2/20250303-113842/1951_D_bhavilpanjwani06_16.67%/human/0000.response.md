Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to help Bob set up stalls with specific pricing so that Alice buys exactly k jewels with her n coins. The program needs to output "YES" if it's possible to set up at most 60 stalls with integer prices between 1 and 10^18 to achieve this, and "NO" otherwise. If "YES", it should also specify the number of stalls and their prices.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order, buys as many jewels as possible with her remaining coins, and moves on to the next stall. The goal is to make sure she buys exactly k jewels.

The program provided seems to handle this in a function called `func_1`, which is called for each test case. The function takes input values n (coins) and k (desired jewels), and decides whether it's possible to set up stalls accordingly.

Looking at the program:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it calls `func_1`.
3. In `func_1`:
- It reads n and k.
- If n < k, it's impossible because Alice can't buy more jewels than she has coins for (each jewel costs at least 1 coin). So, it prints "NO".
- If n == k, it sets up one stall with price 1, so Alice buys one jewel per coin, totaling k jewels.
- If n > k, it checks if k - 1 < n - k + 1. If true, it sets up two stalls: one with price n - k + 1 and another with price 1.

Wait, this seems a bit confusing. Let's try to understand what's happening in the n > k case.

The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is being checked. If true, it sets up two stalls: one with price `n - k + 1` and another with price `1`. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

I need to verify if this logic ensures that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Let me think about how Alice buys jewels in this setup.

Suppose there are two stalls:

1. Stall 1 with price p1 = n - k + 1

2. Stall 2 with price p2 = 1

Alice will first go to stall 1 and buy as many jewels as possible with her n coins.

Number of jewels bought at stall 1: floor(n / p1)

Then, she proceeds to stall 2 with the remaining coins and buys floor(remaining_coins / p2) jewels.

Total jewels bought = floor(n / p1) + floor((n - (floor(n / p1) * p1)) / p2)

We need this to equal k.

Given p1 = n - k + 1 and p2 = 1

Let's compute floor(n / p1):

Since p1 = n - k + 1, floor(n / (n - k + 1))

Letâ€™s denote m = n - k + 1

So, floor(n / m)

We need to see what floor(n / m) is.

Also, remaining coins after buying at stall 1:

n - (floor(n / m) * m)

Then, at stall 2, she buys floor(remaining / 1) = remaining coins.

Total jewels: floor(n / m) + (n - floor(n / m) * m)

But since m = n - k + 1, let's see what floor(n / m) is.

Case 1: m divides n.

Then floor(n / m) = n / m

Remaining coins: n - (n / m) * m = 0

Total jewels: n / m + 0 = n / m

We need this to be equal to k.

But m = n - k + 1

So, n / m = n / (n - k + 1)

For this to be an integer, n must be divisible by (n - k + 1).

Is this always the case? Not necessarily.

Case 2: m does not divide n.

Then floor(n / m) = floor(n / (n - k + 1))

Remaining coins: n - floor(n / m) * m

Total jewels: floor(n / m) + (n - floor(n / m) * m)

Which simplifies to floor(n / m) + (n - floor(n / m) * m)

This is equal to floor(n / m) + n - floor(n / m) * m

But this seems off; actually, since p2 = 1, the remaining coins after stall 1 can buy exactly that many jewels at stall 2.

Wait, no.

Wait, p2 = 1, so floor(remaining / 1) = remaining coins.

Hence, total jewels = floor(n / m) + remaining coins

But remaining coins = n - floor(n / m) * m

So total jewels = floor(n / m) + (n - floor(n / m) * m)

This seems like it's just n, which is not helpful.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, floor(n / m) is the number of jewels bought at stall 1, and remaining coins are n - (floor(n / m) * m), which she can spend at stall 2, buying floor((n - floor(n / m) * m) / 1) jewels, which is exactly the remaining coins.

So total jewels = floor(n / m) + (n - floor(n / m) * m)

But floor(n / m) * m + (n - floor(n / m) * m) = n

So total jewels = floor(n / m) + (n - floor(n / m) * m)

This seems like it's equal to n, but that can't be right because m = n - k + 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to plug in m = n - k + 1.

Let me compute floor(n / (n - k + 1)) and then the remaining coins.

Let me consider an example to see if this logic works.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 7, k = 3

According to the program:

n = 7, k = 3

n > k, so check if k - 1 < n - k + 1

k - 1 = 2

n - k + 1 = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5

2 < 5 is true, so print "YES" and set up 2 stalls with prices 5 and 1.

So, p1 = 5, p2 = 1

Alice buys floor(7 / 5) = 1 jewel at stall 1, spending 5 coins, remaining 2 coins.

Then, buys floor(2 / 1) = 2 jewels at stall 2.

Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k = 3.

Good.

Another example:

n = 6, k = 4

n > k, check if 3 < 6 - 4 + 1 = 3 < 3, which is false (3 is not less than 3), so print "NO"

Is this correct?

Let's see.

We need to find a way to set up stalls so that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

Let's try to find such a setup.

Suppose one stall with p1 = 2.

Alice buys floor(6 / 2) = 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, no coins left for next stalls.

Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Not good.

Another setup: two stalls with p1 = 1 and p2 = something else.

At stall 1, buys floor(6 / 1) = 6 jewels, spends 6 coins, no coins left for next stalls.

Total jewels: 6, which is more than 4.

Not good.

Another setup: three stalls.

Stall 1: p1 = 2, buys floor(6 / 2) = 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, no coins left.

Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Not good.

Another setup: stall 1: p1 = 3, buys floor(6 / 3) = 2 jewels, spends 6 coins.

Total jewels: 2, which is less than 4.

Not good.

Another setup: stall 1: p1 = 1.5, but prices must be integers, so not allowed.

Stall 1: p1 = 1, buys 6 jewels, which is more than 4.

Stall 1: p1 = 2, buys 3 jewels, which is less than 4.

Stall 1: p1 = 1, buys 6 jewels; stall 2: p2 = 1, but no coins left for stall 2.

Stall 1: p1 = 1, buys 6 jewels; stall 2: p2 = 2, no coins left for stall 2.

Total jewels: 6, which is more than 4.

Seems like it's impossible to get exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

Hence, "NO" is the correct answer.

Another example:

n = 255, k = 8

According to the program:

n > k, check if 7 < 255 - 8 + 1 = 7 < 248, which is true, so "YES" with s = 2 stalls, p1 = 248, p2 = 1.

Let's see:

At stall 1: floor(255 / 248) = 1 jewel, spends 248 coins, remaining 7 coins.

At stall 2: floor(7 / 1) = 7 jewels.

Total jewels: 1 + 7 = 8, which matches k = 8.

Good.

But the problem mentions another setup with 8 stalls: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

Let's see:

At stall 1: floor(255 / 128) = 1 jewel, spends 128, remaining 127.

Stall 2: floor(127 / 64) = 1, spends 64, remaining 63.

Stall 3: floor(63 / 32) = 1, spends 32, remaining 31.

Stall 4: floor(31 / 16) = 1, spends 16, remaining 15.

Stall 5: floor(15 / 8) = 1, spends 8, remaining 7.

Stall 6: floor(7 / 4) = 1, spends 4, remaining 3.

Stall 7: floor(3 / 2) = 1, spends 2, remaining 1.

Stall 8: floor(1 / 1) = 1, spends 1, remaining 0.

Total jewels: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8.

So, this also works.

But the program only sets up 2 stalls in this case, which is allowed since s <= 60.

Now, let's see if the program's logic is correct in general.

The program seems to handle three cases:

1. n < k: impossible, prints "NO".

2. n == k: set up one stall with price 1, so Alice buys one jewel per coin, totaling k jewels.

3. n > k:

- Check if k - 1 < n - k + 1.

- If true, set up two stalls: p1 = n - k + 1, p2 = 1.

- Else, print "NO".

I need to verify if this logic is sufficient to cover all possible cases where it's possible to set up at most 60 stalls to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

First, the n < k case is straightforward: impossible, since each jewel costs at least 1 coin.

The n == k case is also straightforward: set price 1, so Alice buys one jewel per coin.

The n > k case is more interesting.

The program checks if k - 1 < n - k + 1.

Wait, let's rephrase that condition.

k - 1 < n - k + 1

Which simplifies to:

k - 1 < n - k + 1

Add k - 1 to both sides:

2(k - 1) < n + 1

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of stalls.

In the examples, with n = 7 and k = 3, it used two stalls: p1 = 5, p2 = 1.

With n = 6 and k = 4, it's "NO".

With n = 255 and k = 8, it used two stalls: p1 = 248, p2 = 1.

But in the problem description, there's another setup with eight stalls: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

So, the program seems to prefer minimal stalls setup, but the problem allows up to 60 stalls.

Is the program's logic sufficient to cover all possible cases where it's possible to set up at most 60 stalls to achieve exactly k jewels?

I need to think about whether there are cases where it's possible to achieve k jewels with up to 60 stalls, but the program's logic doesn't find it and incorrectly prints "NO".

Alternatively, is there any case where the program says "YES" but the actual number of jewels bought isn't k?

From the examples, it seems correct, but I need to think more generally.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n = 5, k = 2.

According to the program:

n > k, check if 1 < 5 - 2 + 1 = 1 < 4, which is true.

So, "YES" with s = 2, p1 = 4, p2 = 1.

Alice buys floor(5 / 4) = 1 jewel at stall 1, spends 4 coins, remaining 1 coin.

At stall 2, buys floor(1 / 1) = 1 jewel.

Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k = 2.

Good.

Another example: n = 10, k = 5.

Check if 4 < 10 - 5 + 1 = 4 < 6, which is true.

So, "YES" with s = 2, p1 = 6, p2 = 1.

Alice buys floor(10 / 6) = 1 jewel, spends 6 coins, remaining 4 coins.

At stall 2, buys floor(4 / 1) = 4 jewels.

Total jewels: 1 + 4 = 5, which matches k = 5.

Good.

Another example: n = 10, k = 3.

Check if 2 < 10 - 3 + 1 = 2 < 8, which is true.

So, "YES" with s = 2, p1 = 8, p2 = 1.

Alice buys floor(10 / 8) = 1 jewel, spends 8 coins, remaining 2 coins.

At stall 2, buys floor(2 / 1) = 2 jewels.

Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k = 3.

Good.

Another example: n = 10, k = 4.

Check if 3 < 10 - 4 + 1 = 3 < 7, which is true.

So, "YES" with s = 2, p1 = 7, p2 = 1.

Alice buys floor(10 / 7) = 1 jewel, spends 7 coins, remaining 3 coins.

At stall 2, buys floor(3 / 1) = 3 jewels.

Total jewels: 1 + 3 = 4, which matches k = 4.

Good.

Another example: n = 10, k = 6.

Check if 5 < 10 - 6 + 1 = 5 < 5, which is false.

So, "NO".

But is it possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 6 jewels with 10 coins?

Let's try:

- Stall 1: p1 = 2, Alice buys floor(10 / 2) = 5 jewels, spends 10 coins, no coins left for next stalls.

Total jewels: 5, which is less than 6.

- Stall 1: p1 = 1, buys floor(10 / 1) = 10 jewels, which is more than 6.

- Stall 1: p1 = 1, buys 10 jewels; stall 2: p2 = anything, but no coins left.

Total jewels: 10, which is more than 6.

- Stall 1: p1 = 1, buys 10 jewels; stall 2: p2 = 1, but no coins left.

Total jewels: 10.

- Stall 1: p1 = 2, buys 5 jewels, spends 10 coins.

Total jewels: 5.

- Stall 1: p1 = 1.666, not integer.

- Stall 1: p1 = 3, buys floor(10 / 3) = 3 jewels, spends 9 coins, remaining 1 coin.

At stall 2: p2 = 1, buys 1 jewel.

Total jewels: 3 + 1 = 4, which is less than 6.

- Stall 1: p1 = 1, buys 10 jewels; stall 2: p2 = 1, no coins left.

Total jewels: 10.

- Stall 1: p1 = 2, buys 5 jewels, spends 10 coins.

Total jewels: 5.

- Stall 1: p1 = 1, buys 10 jewels; stall 2: p2 = 2, no coins left.

Total jewels: 10.

Seems like it's impossible to get exactly 6 jewels with 10 coins in this setup.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Another example: n = 1, k = 1.

n == k, so "YES" with s = 1, p1 = 1.

Alice buys 1 jewel, spends 1 coin.

Good.

n = 1, k = 2.

n < k, "NO".

Correct, since each jewel costs at least 1 coin, Alice can't buy 2 jewels with 1 coin.

Another example: n = 5, k = 1.

n > k, check if 0 < 5 - 1 + 1 = 0 < 5, which is true.

So, "YES" with s = 2, p1 = 5, p2 = 1.

Alice buys floor(5 / 5) = 1 jewel, spends 5 coins, no coins left.

Total jewels: 1.

Good.

Another example: n = 5, k = 2.

As above, works.

Another example: n = 5, k = 3.

Check if 2 < 5 - 3 + 1 = 2 < 3, which is true.

So, "YES" with s = 2, p1 = 3, p2 = 1.

Alice buys floor(5 / 3) = 1 jewel, spends 3 coins, remaining 2 coins.

At stall 2: buys floor(2 / 1) = 2 jewels.

Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3.

Good.

Another example: n = 5, k = 4.

Check if 3 < 5 - 4 + 1 = 3 < 2, which is false.

So, "NO".

Is it possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with 5 coins?

Let's try:

- Stall 1: p1 = 1, buys floor(5 / 1) = 5 jewels, which is more than 4.

- Stall 1: p1 = 2, buys floor(5 / 2) = 2 jewels, spends 4 coins, remaining 1 coin.

At stall 2: p2 = 1, buys 1 jewel.

Total jewels: 2 + 1 = 3, which is less than 4.

- Stall 1: p1 = 1.25, not integer.

- Stall 1: p1 = 3, buys floor(5 / 3) = 1 jewel, spends 3 coins, remaining 2 coins.

At stall 2: p2 = 1, buys 2 jewels.

Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which is less than 4.

- Stall 1: p1 = 4, buys floor(5 / 4) = 1 jewel, spends 4 coins, remaining 1 coin.

At stall 2: p2 = 1, buys 1 jewel.

Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, which is less than 4.

Seems like it's impossible to get exactly 4 jewels with 5 coins.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

So, in all these examples, the program seems to be giving the correct answer.

But I need to think more generally.

Let me try to understand the logic behind the program.

In the n > k case, the program sets up two stalls: p1 = n - k + 1 and p2 = 1.

Let's see what this achieves.

At stall 1, Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels, spends floor(n / p1) * p1 coins.

Remaining coins: n - floor(n / p1) * p1

At stall 2, buys floor(remaining / 1) = remaining coins jewels.

Total jewels: floor(n / p1)
