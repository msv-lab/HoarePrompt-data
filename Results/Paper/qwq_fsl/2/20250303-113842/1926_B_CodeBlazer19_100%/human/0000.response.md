Alright, I've got this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. If the program meets the requirements for every potential case, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that even if there's one case where the program doesn't work as expected, the correctness is "False". I need to be thorough in my analysis.

First, I need to understand the problem description completely. The task is to determine whether a given binary square grid of size n x n contains a triangle or a square made up of '1's. The shape is either a triangle or a square, and it's guaranteed that there's exactly one such shape consisting of all the '1's in the grid, and the size is greater than 1.

Let's break down the definitions:

1. **Triangle**:
   - Consists of k rows (k > 1), where each row i has 2*i - 1 '1's.
   - The '1's are centered in one column.
   - It can be upside down.

   For example, for k=3:
   ```
   0 0 1 0 0
   0 1 1 1 0
   1 1 1 1 1
   ```

   Or upside down:
   ```
   1 1 1 1 1
   0 1 1 1 0
   0 0 1 0 0
   ```

2. **Square**:
   - Consists of k rows (k > 1), each with k '1's.
   - The '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.

   For example, for k=3:
   ```
   0 0 1 1 1
   0 0 1 1 1
   0 0 1 1 1
   ```

The program needs to read multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10), followed by n lines of n characters each, consisting of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it should output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the shape formed by the '1's.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it correctly implements this logic.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = 0
        b = ''
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
```

My initial thoughts are that this program is trying to determine the shape based on the count of '1's in each row. If a row has exactly one '1', it assumes it's a triangle; if it has more than one '1', it assumes it's a square.

However, this seems too simplistic and might not capture the full complexity of the problem. Let's consider some potential issues:

1. **Multiple shapes in a grid**: The problem states that there is exactly one shape consisting of all '1's, so this shouldn't be an issue.

2. **Position of '1's**: The program doesn't consider the positions of '1's in the rows, only the count. This could be a problem because both triangles and squares can have rows with the same number of '1's, but their positions differ.

   - For example, in a square, all '1's in a row are aligned to the left or right, while in a triangle, they are centered.

3. **Upside-down triangles**: The program doesn't account for the orientation of the triangle.

4. **Minimum size**: The shape size is greater than 1, which is already handled since k > 1.

Let me think of specific examples where this program might fail.

**Example 1:**

Input:

```

2

3

000

011

011

4

0000

0000

0100

1110

```

Expected Output:

```

SQUARE

TRIANGLE

```

In the first test case:

```

000

011

011

```

This is a square of size 2.

In the second test case:

```

0000

0000

0100

1110

```

This is a triangle with k=3.

Let's see how the program processes this:

- For the first test case:

  - Row 1: '000' → count('1') = 0

  - Row 2: '011' → count('1') = 2 → b = 'SQUARE'

  - Row 3: '011' → count('1') = 2 → b = 'SQUARE'

  - Since a remains 0, output 'SQUARE'

- For the second test case:

  - Row 1: '0000' → count('1') = 0

  - Row 2: '0000' → count('1') = 0

  - Row 3: '0100' → count('1') = 1 → a = 'TRIANGLE'

  - Row 4: '1110' → count('1') = 3 → b = 'SQUARE'

  - Since a != 0, output 'TRIANGLE'

This matches the expected output.

**Example 2:**

Input:

```

1

3

111

111

111

```

Expected Output:

```

SQUARE

```

Program processing:

- Row 1: '111' → count('1') = 3 → b = 'SQUARE'

- Row 2: '111' → count('1') = 3 → b = 'SQUARE'

- Row 3: '111' → count('1') = 3 → b = 'SQUARE'

- Since a remains 0, output 'SQUARE'

This is correct.

**Example 3:**

Input:

```

1

3

001

011

111

```

Expected Output:

```

TRIANGLE

```

Program processing:

- Row 1: '001' → count('1') = 1 → a = 'TRIANGLE'

- Row 2: '011' → count('1') = 2 → b = 'SQUARE'

- Row 3: '111' → count('1') = 3 → b = 'SQUARE'

- Since a != 0, output 'TRIANGLE'

This is correct.

**Example 4:**

Input:

```

1

4

0000

0000

0000

0000

```

Expected Output:

```

SQUARE or TRIANGLE?

```

Wait, the problem says that there is exactly one triangle or one square consisting of all the '1's, and the shape size is greater than 1. In this case, there are no '1's, which shouldn't happen because the shape size is greater than 1. So, this input is invalid based on the problem's guarantee.

**Example 5:**

Input:

```

1

2

11

11

```

Expected Output:

```

SQUARE

```

Program processing:

- Row 1: '11' → count('1') = 2 → b = 'SQUARE'

- Row 2: '11' → count('1') = 2 → b = 'SQUARE'

- Since a remains 0, output 'SQUARE'

Correct.

**Example 6:**

Input:

```

1

2

10

11

```

Expected Output:

```

TRIANGLE

```

Wait, in this case, the '1's form a triangle:

Row 1: '10' → one '1'

Row 2: '11' → two '1's

This matches the triangle pattern where k=2:

- Row 1: 1 '1' (2*1 -1 =1)

- Row 2: 3 '1's (but in this case, it's '11', which is two '1's)

Wait, this is inconsistent with the triangle definition. The triangle should have rows with 1, 3, 5, etc., '1's. Here, row 2 has two '1's, which doesn't match. So, perhaps this isn't a valid triangle.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a triangle. But according to the problem, there is exactly one shape consisting of all '1's, either a triangle or a square.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the definition.

Looking back:

- **Triangle**: k rows, row i has 2*i -1 '1's, centered in one column. Can be upside down.

- **Square**: k rows, each with k '1's, positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.

In the above example:

```

10

11

```

This isn't a square because the rows don't have the same number of '1's. It's not a triangle because the second row has two '1's, which doesn't fit the 2*i -1 pattern for i=2 (which would be 3 '1's).

But according to the problem, it's guaranteed that there is exactly one triangle or one square consisting of all '1's, and the size is greater than 1. So, perhaps such an invalid grid won't be provided.

Given that, I should assume that the input will always form a valid triangle or square as per the definitions.

Now, back to the program. It seems to rely solely on the count of '1's in each row to determine the shape.

Potential issues:

- It doesn't check the positions of '1's, which are crucial for both triangle and square definitions.

- For a triangle, the '1's need to be centered, whereas for a square, they need to be aligned to one side.

- The program might incorrectly classify shapes if the counts coincide but the positions don't match the definitions.

Let's think of a case where the counts match but the positions don't.

**Example 7:**

Input:

```

1

3

001

011

111

```

Expected Output:

```

TRIANGLE

```

Program processing:

- Row 1: '001' → count('1') =1 → a='TRIANGLE'

- Row 2: '011' → count('1')=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 3: '111' → count('1')=3 → b='SQUARE'

- Since a !=0, output 'TRIANGLE'

Correct.

**Example 8:**

Input:

```

1

3

011

011

011

```

Expected Output:

```

SQUARE

```

Program processing:

- Row 1: '011' → count('1')=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 2: '011' → count('1')=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 3: '011' → count('1')=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Since a remains 0, output 'SQUARE'

This seems correct, but let's check if this is actually a square.

According to the square definition, it should have k rows with k '1's, positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.

Here, k=2, and each row has two '1's, aligned to the right (since the '1's are in columns 2 and 3).

So, it should be a square.

But wait, in a square, the '1's should be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge, meaning they should start from the same column in each row.

In this case, yes, they start from column 2 and span to column 3.

So, this is a valid square.

**Example 9:**

Input:

```

1

3

111

111

111

```

Expected Output:

```

SQUARE

```

Program processing:

- Row 1: '111' → count('1')=3 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 2: '111' → count('1')=3 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 3: '111' → count('1')=3 → b='SQUARE'

- Since a remains 0, output 'SQUARE'

Correct.

**Example 10:**

Input:

```

1

4

0011

0011

0011

0011

```

Expected Output:

```

SQUARE

```

Program processing:

- Row 1: '0011' → count('1')=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 2: '0011' → count('1')=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 3: '0011' → count('1')=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 4: '0011' → count('1')=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Since a remains 0, output 'SQUARE'

Correct.

**Example 11:**

Input:

```

1

4

0001

0011

0111

1111

```

Expected Output:

```

TRIANGLE

```

Program processing:

- Row 1: '0001' → count('1')=1 → a='TRIANGLE'

- Row 2: '0011' → count('1')=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 3: '0111' → count('1')=3 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 4: '1111' → count('1')=4 → b='SQUARE'

- Since a !=0, output 'TRIANGLE'

Correct.

Wait, but is this actually a triangle?

Looking at the counts:

- Row 1: 1 '1'

- Row 2: 2 '1's

- Row 3: 3 '1's

- Row 4: 4 '1's

This matches the triangle pattern where each row has 2*i -1 '1's for i=1 to 4:

- i=1: 1

- i=2: 3

- i=3: 5

- i=4: 7

But in this example, rows have 1,2,3,4 '1's, which doesn't match the triangle definition. So, this shouldn't be considered a triangle.

But according to the program, since there's a row with count('1')=1, it sets a='TRIANGLE', and outputs 'TRIANGLE'.

But according to the problem, the shape is either a valid triangle or a valid square, and it's guaranteed that there's exactly one such shape.

So, perhaps such an invalid grid won't be provided.

But to ensure the program is correct, I need to consider if there are any cases where the program incorrectly identifies the shape based on the given definitions.

Let's think of another example.

**Example 12:**

Input:

```

1

3

011

010

000

```

Expected Output:

```

SQUARE

```

Program processing:

- Row 1: '011' → count('1')=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 2: '010' → count('1')=1 → a='TRIANGLE'

- Row 3: '000' → count('1')=0

- Since a !=0, output 'TRIANGLE'

But according to the problem, there is exactly one shape consisting of all '1's, which in this case seems to be a square:

```

011

010

000

```

This looks like a square of size 2, but the second row has only one '1', which might confuse the program.

Wait, according to the square definition, each row should have k '1's, positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.

Here, the first row has two '1's, the second row has one '1', which doesn't match the square definition. So, perhaps this isn't a valid square.

But according to the problem, it's guaranteed that there is exactly one triangle or one square consisting all '1's, so such an invalid grid shouldn't be provided.

Given that, perhaps the program is relying on the guarantees in the problem statement.

Another issue is that the program doesn't check if the '1's form a connected shape as per the definitions. It only looks at the count of '1's per row.

Let's think of a case where the counts match but the positions don't.

**Example 13:**

Input:

```

1

3

010

011

011

```

Expected Output:

```

TRIANGLE

```

Program processing:

- Row 1: '010' → count('1')=1 → a='TRIANGLE'

- Row 2: '011' → count('1')=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 3: '011' → count('1')=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Since a !=0, output 'TRIANGLE'

But in this grid:

```

010

011

011

```

This doesn't form a valid triangle or square as per the definitions. The '1's in row 2 and 3 are not centered for a triangle, and the rows don't have the same number of '1's for a square.

But according to the problem, such invalid grids won't be provided, as there is exactly one valid triangle or square consisting of all '1's.

Given that, perhaps the program is correct under the problem's guarantees.

Let me consider the example from the problem statement.

**Example from the problem:**

Input:

```

3

111

111

111

```

Expected Output:

```

SQUARE

TRIANGLE

SQUARE

TRIANGLE

TRIANGLE

SQUARE

```

Let's see how the program processes this:

1. Test case 1:

   - Rows: '000', '011', '011'

   - Counts: 0, 2, 2 → b='SQUARE' → output 'SQUARE'

2. Test case 2:

   - Rows: '0000', '0000', '0100', '1110'

   - Counts: 0, 0, 1, 3 → a='TRIANGLE', b='SQUARE' → output 'TRIANGLE'

3. Test case 3:

   - Rows: '11', '11'

   - Counts: 2, 2 → b='SQUARE' → output 'SQUARE'

4. Test case 4:

   - Rows: '00111', '00010', '00000', '00000', '00000'

   - Counts: 3, 1, 0, 0, 0 → a='TRIANGLE', b='SQUARE' → output 'TRIANGLE'

5. Test case 5:

   - Rows: (10 rows of 0's except)

   - Assume it's the last test case with '1111111110', '0111111100', etc.

   - Counts vary, but let's assume it's processed correctly as 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE'

6. Test case 6:

   - Rows: '111', '111', '111'

   - Counts: 3, 3, 3 → b='SQUARE' → output 'SQUARE'

Seems to match the expected output.

Given that, and considering the problem's guarantees, perhaps the program is correct.

But to be thorough, I need to consider if there are any edge cases where the program might fail.

**Edge Case 1: Minimum size k=2 for triangle and square.**

- Triangle with k=2:

  ```

  010

  111

  ```

  Program processing:

  - Row 1: '010' → count=1 → a='TRIANGLE'

  - Row 2: '111' → count=3 → b='SQUARE'

  - Output 'TRIANGLE' (correct)

- Square with k=2:

  ```

  0011

  0011

  ```

  Program processing:

  - Row 1: '0011' → count=2 → b='SQUARE'

  - Row 2: '0011' → count=2 → b='SQUARE'

  - Output 'SQUARE' (correct)

**Edge Case 2: All rows have more than one '1', but positions don't form a square.**

- Input:

  ```

  3

  011

  011

  011

  ```

  This is processed as 'SQUARE' by the program, which is correct.

**Edge Case 3: Rows have varying counts, but form a valid triangle.**

- Input:

  ```

  4

  0001

  0011

  0111

  1111

  ```

  Program processing:

  - Row 1: '0001' → count=1 → a='TRIANGLE'

  - Row 2: '0011' → count=2 → b='SQUARE'

  - Row 3: '0111' → count=3 → b='SQUARE'

  - Row 4: '1111' → count=4 → b='SQUARE'

  - Output 'TRIANGLE' (correct)

**Edge Case 4: Upside-down triangle.**

- Input:

  ```

  3

  111

  011

  001

  ```

  Program processing:

  - Row 1: '111' → count=3 → b='SQUARE'

  - Row 2: '011' → count=2 → b='SQUARE'

  - Row 3: '001' → count=1 → a='TRIANGLE'

  - Output 'TRIANGLE' (correct)

Seems like the program handles these cases correctly.

**Potential Failure Case:**

- Input where a square has rows with varying counts of '1's, but according to the definition, all rows in a square should have the same number of '1's.

Wait, no, in a square, each row has exactly k '1's, positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.

So, if a grid is a valid square, all rows will have the same number of '1's.

Hence, the program should correctly identify it as a square.

Similarly, for a triangle, rows should have increasing odd numbers of '1's.

The program checks only the count of '1's per row, not their positions.

But given the problem's guarantees, perhaps this simplistic approach works.

Alternatively, maybe there's a case where a grid looks like a square in terms of '1' counts per row, but actually forms a triangle, or vice versa.

Wait, let's consider:

**Example 14:**

Input:

```

1

3

011

011

011

```

This should be a square.

Program processing:

- Row 1: '011' → count=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 2: '011' → count=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 3: '011' → count=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Output 'SQUARE'

This is correct.

But what if we have:

**Example 15:**

Input:

```

1

3

010

011

011

```

Program processing:

- Row 1: '010' → count=1 → a='TRIANGLE'

- Row 2: '011' → count=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Row 3: '011' → count=2 → b='SQUARE'

- Output 'TRIANGLE'

But according to the problem guarantees, this should be a valid triangle or square.

Given the counts 1,2,2, it might be intended as a triangle, but the positions need to be checked.

However, since the problem guarantees that the grid forms exactly one triangle or one square, and it's guaranteed to be correct, perhaps such invalid grids won't be provided.

Given that, and considering all the examples I've thought of so far, the program seems to be correct.

Therefore, the correctness is **True**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given binary square grid forms a specific shape: either a triangle or a square, based on the arrangement of '1's in the grid.

### Approach

1. **Problem Understanding**:
    - **Triangle**: Comprised of `k` rows where each row `i` has `2*i - 1` consecutive '1's, centered in one column. It can be upside down.
    - **Square**: Comprised of `k` rows, each containing `k` consecutive '1's, positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.

2. **Insight**:
    - The provided program checks the count of '1's in each row to determine the shape.
    - If any row has exactly one '1', it marks it as a triangle.
    - If a row has more than one '1', it marks it as a square.

3. **Guarantees**:
    - Each test case has exactly one shape (triangle or square).
    - The shape consists of all '1's in the grid.
    - The size of the shape is greater than 1.

Given these guarantees, the program's simplistic approach of checking the count of '1's per row seems sufficient to distinguish between the two shapes.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = 0
        b = ''
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
    - Read the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, read the grid size `n` and the grid itself.

2. **Processing Each Row**:
    - Count the number of '1's in each row.
    - If any row has exactly one '1', set `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
    - If any row has more than one '1', set `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Determine the Shape**:
    - If `a` is set (i.e., at least one row has a single '1'), print 'TRIANGLE'.
    - Otherwise, print 'SQUARE'.

This approach leverages the problem's guarantees to ensure correctness for all valid inputs. By focusing on the count of '1's per row, it effectively differentiates between the defined shapes of triangles and squares in the grid.
