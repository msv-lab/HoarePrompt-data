Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a provided problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether a given array of numbers can form a "progressive square" of size n, given values for c and d. The progressive square is constructed based on specific rules involving a_{1,1}, c, and d.

First, I need to understand what a progressive square is. From the description, it seems that each element in the n x n matrix is calculated using the formula: a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d, where i and j are the row and column indices starting from 1.

So, the program's task is to check if the given array b contains exactly the elements that would be in this progressive square, regardless of order.

Looking at the program:

```python

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())

    l = list(map(int, input().split()))

    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):

    a = min(l)

    li = []

    for k in range(0, n):

        for h in range(0, n):

            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)

    li.sort()

    l.sort()

    if l == li:

        return 'yes'

    return 'no'

```

The function `func_1` seems to be doing the following:

1. Find the minimum value in the array `l` and assign it to `a`, which presumably corresponds to a_{1,1}.

2. Generate a list `li` by calculating a_{i,j} for each position in the n x n grid using the formula a + k*c + h*d, where k and h are zero-based indices.

3. Sort both `li` and `l` and check if they are equal.

If they are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, 'no'.

Now, I need to verify if this program correctly implements the required functionality for all possible cases.

First, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

Input:

5

3 2 3

3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8

3 2 3

3 9 6 5 7 1 11 4 8

2 100 100

400 300 400 500

3 2 3

3 9 6 6 5 1 11 4 8

4 4 4

15 27 7 19 23 23 11 15 7 3 19 23 11 15 11 15

Output:

NO

YES

YES

NO

NO

Let's see if the program would produce these outputs.

Take the first test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3

b = [3,9,6,5,7,1,10,4,8]

The program finds a = min(b) = 1

Then generates li:

For k=0, h=0: 1 + 0*2 + 0*3 = 1

k=0, h=1: 1 + 0*2 +1*3 = 4

k=0, h=2: 1 + 0*2 +2*3 = 7

k=1, h=0: 1 +1*2 +0*3 = 3

k=1, h=1: 1 +1*2 +1*3 = 6

k=1, h=2: 1 +1*2 +2*3 = 9

k=2, h=0: 1 +2*2 +0*3 = 5

k=2, h=1: 1 +2*2 +1*3 = 8

k=2, h=2: 1 +2*2 +2*3 = 11

So, li = [1,4,7,3,6,9,5,8,11]

Sort li: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

Sort b: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

Comparing sorted li and sorted b: they are not equal because 10 != 11. So, output should be 'NO', which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3

b = [3,9,6,5,7,1,11,4,8]

a = min(b) = 1

li = same as above: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

sorted b: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

They match, so output 'YES'.

Third test case:

n=2, c=100, d=100

b = [400,300,400,500]

a = min(b) = 300

li = [300 +0*100 +0*100 = 300,

300 +0*100 +1*100 = 400,

300 +1*100 +0*100 = 400,

300 +1*100 +1*100 = 500]

sorted li: [300,400,400,500]

sorted b: [300,400,400,500]

They match, 'YES'.

Fourth test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3

b = [3,9,6,6,5,1,11,4,8]

a = min(b) = 1

li = same as above: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

sorted b: [1,3,4,5,6,6,8,9,11]

sorted li: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

They differ because b has two 6's and only one 7, so 'NO'.

Fifth test case:

n=4, c=4, d=4

b = [15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15]

a = min(b) = 3

li = [3 + k*4 + h*4 for k=0 to 3, h=0 to 3]

So:

k=0,h=0: 3 +0 +0 = 3

k=0,h=1: 3 +0 +4 = 7

k=0,h=2: 3 +0 +8 = 11

k=0,h=3: 3 +0 +12 = 15

k=1,h=0: 3 +4 +0 = 7

k=1,h=1: 3 +4 +4 = 11

k=1,h=2: 3 +4 +8 = 15

k=1,h=3: 3 +4 +12 = 19

k=2,h=0: 3 +8 +0 = 11

k=2,h=1: 3 +8 +4 = 15

k=2,h=2: 3 +8 +8 = 19

k=2,h=3: 3 +8 +12 = 23

k=3,h=0: 3 +12 +0 = 15

k=3,h=1: 3 +12 +4 = 19

k=3,h=2: 3 +12 +8 = 23

k=3,h=3: 3 +12 +12 = 27

So, li = [3,7,11,15,7,11,15,19,11,15,19,23,15,19,23,27]

sorted li: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,19,23,23,27]

sorted b: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,27]

They match, so 'YES'. But according to the sample output, it's 'NO'. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, b has 15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15

Let's count the frequencies:

- 3: 1

- 7: 2

- 11: 4

- 15: 5

- 19: 2

- 23: 3

- 27: 1

And li should have:

- 3:1

- 7:2

- 11:3

- 15:4

- 19:2

- 23:2

- 27:1

Wait, frequencies don't match. b has 15 five times, but li has only four 15's. So, they don't match, hence 'NO'.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for these examples.

Now, I need to think if there are any edge cases where this program might fail.

One thing to consider is that the program assumes that the minimum value in b is a_{1,1}. Is this always true?

Well, a_{1,1} is the smallest element in the progressive square because all other elements are obtained by adding non-negative multiples of c and d to a_{1,1}. So, yes, a_{1,1} is indeed the minimum value in the square.

So, finding a = min(l) seems correct.

Another thing to consider is that c and d are both positive integers, as per the examples and the problem statement seems to imply that c and d are positive.

If c or d were zero, the square would have repeated values in rows or columns, but since c and d are positive, all elements should be unique unless c and d are such that some combinations result in the same value.

Wait, but c and d are positive integers, and a_{1,1} is an integer, so all a_{i,j} should be distinct unless c and d are such that c and d are multiples of each other.

Wait, if c and d are multiples, then some a_{i,j} could be equal.

For example, if c = 2 and d = 4, then a_{1,1} + c = a_{1,1} + d/2, so possible overlaps.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that for any values of n, a_{1,1}, c, and d, there exists exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules. So, probably, the problem assumes that all a_{i,j} are unique.

But in reality, if c and d are multiples, there could be duplicates.

Wait, in the first example, n=3, c=2, d=3, a_{1,1}=1, the generated square has unique elements: 1,4,7,3,6,9,5,8,11.

But if c=2 and d=4, then:

a_{1,1}=1

a_{1,2}=1 +0*2 +1*4=5

a_{1,3}=1 +0*2 +2*4=9

a_{2,1}=1 +1*2 +0*4=3

a_{2,2}=1 +1*2 +1*4=7

a_{2,3}=1 +1*2 +2*4=11

a_{3,1}=1 +2*2 +0*4=5

a_{3,2}=1 +2*2 +1*4=9

a_{3,3}=1 +2*2 +2*4=13

Wait, here a_{1,2}=5 and a_{3,1}=5, which are duplicates.

So, in this case, the progressive square would have duplicates.

But according to the problem, it's guaranteed that for given n, c, d, and a_{1,1}, there exists exactly one progressive square.

But in this case, if c and d are such that c and d are multiples, leading to duplicates, then the frequencies of the numbers matter.

Looking back at the program, it sorts both lists and checks for equality.

In the case where there are duplicates, this should still work because it's checking the frequency of each number.

But, in the example above, with c=2 and d=4, n=3, a_{1,1}=1, li would be [1,3,5,5,7,9,9,11,13], sorted as [1,3,5,5,7,9,9,11,13].

If b is [1,3,5,5,7,9,9,11,13], it should say 'YES', and if b has different frequencies, 'NO'.

So, the program seems to handle duplicates correctly.

Another potential edge case is when n=2, c=1, d=1, a_{1,1}=1.

Then, li = [1,2,2,3], sorted as [1,2,2,3].

If b is [1,2,2,3], 'YES'; if b is [1,2,3,4], 'NO'.

The program should handle this correctly.

What if c=0 or d=0? The problem states c and d are at least 1, so c and d are at least 1.

So, no issue there.

What if n=2, c=1, d=1, a_{1,1}=1, and b=[1,2,2,3]? Should be 'YES'.

Another consideration: what if the array b contains numbers outside the range of possible a_{i,j}? The program would still compare the sorted lists, and since li contains only the possible values, if b has any number outside that, it would fail, which is correct.

Also, what if b has duplicates beyond what li has? For example, b has two 2's when li has only one 2.

It should correctly identify it as 'NO'.

I think the program handles all these cases correctly.

Another thing to check is the time complexity. Since n can be up to 500, and t up to 10^4, but the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 25*10^4, which is manageable.

Generating li takes O(n^2), sorting takes O(n^2 log n), and comparing takes O(n^2).

Given that n^2 can be up to 25*10^4, and t is up to 10^4, but sum of n^2 over all test cases is limited, it should be fine.

I don't see any logical errors in the program. It correctly identifies whether the sorted b matches the sorted li, which should determine if b can form the progressive square.

Hence, I would say the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: **True**}} \]
