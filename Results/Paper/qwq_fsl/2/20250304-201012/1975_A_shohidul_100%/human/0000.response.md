Alright, I've been given this task to verify the correctness of a Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to determine whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix, swapping them, and concatenating them back together.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. The problem states that we have an array `a` of length `n`, consisting of positive integers. We can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

- Split the array into two parts: a prefix `x` and a suffix `y`, such that `a = x + y`.

- Swap these two parts to get `a := y + x`.

After performing this operation as many times as needed, we want to check if the array can become sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
```

My task is to determine if this program correctly solves the problem as described. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". Additionally, I need to provide an explanation for my verdict.

Let me start by analyzing the program step by step.

1. The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

3. It first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all`. If it is, it prints 'YES' immediately.

4. If the array is not sorted, it looks for the first position `i` where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.

5. Once such a position is found, it creates a new array `new` consisting of elements from index `i` to the end of the array.

6. It then checks two conditions:

   a. `check_all_new`: whether the first element of the original array `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`.

   b. `new_all`: whether the `new` array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

7. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Now, I need to verify if this logic correctly determines whether the array can be sorted by performing the specified operation any number of times.

First, let's consider what the operation does. The operation allows us to split the array into a prefix and a suffix and swap them. This is similar to rotating the array, but with a specific constraint on how the rotation is performed.

However, in standard rotation, we can rotate the array by any number of positions in one direction. Here, the operation allows us to choose any split point and swap the prefix and suffix.

I need to think about whether performing this operation any number of times can achieve a sorted array.

Let me consider some examples to understand this better.

**Example 1:**

Input:

3

6

1 1 4 5 1 4

5

7 9 2 2 3

3

1 2 3

Output:

No

Yes

Yes

According to the program's logic:

- For the first test case: [1,1,4,5,1,4]

  - It's not sorted.

  - Find the first position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=5 (0-based index 4), since 5 > 1.

  - new = [1,4]

  - check_all_new: a[0] = 1 >= all in new: 1 >=1 and 1>=4? No, 1 < 4. So check_all_new is False.

  - Hence, prints 'NO'.

  - Which matches the sample output.

- For the second test case: [7,9,2,2,3]

  - Not sorted.

  - First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based index 1), since 9 > 2.

  - new = [2,2,3]

  - check_all_new: a[0] =7 >= all in new: 7 >=2, 7>=2, 7>=3. True.

  - new_all: [2,2,3] is sorted. True.

  - Hence, prints 'YES'.

  - Which matches the sample output.

- For the third test case: [1,2,3]

  - Already sorted.

  - Prints 'YES'.

  - Matches the sample output.

So, the program seems correct for these cases. But I need to think if there are any edge cases where this logic might fail.

Let me think about a case where the array is not sorted, but after performing the operation, it becomes sorted.

For example:

Array: [3,1,2]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based index 1), since 3 > 1.

- new = [2]

- check_all_new: a[0]=3 >=2? Yes.

- new_all: [2] is sorted. Yes.

- So, it should print 'YES'.

But can [3,1,2] be sorted by performing the operation?

Let's see:

- Original: [3,1,2]

- Possible splits and swaps:

  - x=[3], y=[1,2] -> y+x=[1,2,3] -> which is sorted.

So, in this case, it can be sorted with one operation.

The program's logic seems to handle this correctly.

Another case:

Array: [2,3,1,4]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=3 (0-based index 2), since 3 > 1.

- new = [1,4]

- check_all_new: a[0]=2 >=1 and 2>=4? No, 2 < 4.

- So, it would print 'NO'.

But can this array be sorted with the operation?

- Original: [2,3,1,4]

- Possible splits and swaps:

  - x=[2], y=[3,1,4] -> y+x=[3,1,4,2]

  - x=[2,3], y=[1,4] -> y+x=[1,4,2,3]

  - x=[2,3,1], y=[4] -> y+x=[4,2,3,1]

None of these are sorted.

So, the program correctly prints 'NO' for this case.

Wait, but according to the problem, we can perform the operation any number of times. So, even if one operation doesn't sort it, maybe multiple operations can.

Let's check:

Array: [2,1,3]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based index 1), since 2 > 1.

- new = [3]

- check_all_new: a[0]=2 >=3? No.

- So, it would print 'NO'.

But can we sort it with multiple operations?

- Original: [2,1,3]

- Operation 1: x=[2], y=[1,3] -> y+x=[1,3,2]

- Operation 2: x=[1], y=[3,2] -> y+x=[3,2,1]

- Operation 3: x=[3], y=[2,1] -> y+x=[2,1,3]

- Operation 4: x=[2], y=[1,3] -> y+x=[1,3,2]

It seems to cycle through the same permutations without reaching a sorted array.

So, in this case, the program correctly identifies it as 'NO'.

Another case:

Array: [4,5,1,2,3]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=3 (0-based index 2), since 5 >1.

- new = [1,2,3]

- check_all_new: a[0]=4 >=1,4>=2,4>=3. All true.

- new_all: [1,2,3] is sorted. True.

- So, it prints 'YES'.

But can we sort it with the operation?

- Operation 1: x=[4], y=[5,1,2,3] -> y+x=[5,1,2,3,4]

- Operation 2: x=[5], y=[1,2,3,4] -> y+x=[1,2,3,4,5]

- Sorted!

So, it can be sorted with two operations.

Hence, the program correctly identifies it as 'YES'.

Wait, but according to the program, it should print 'YES' if the conditions are met, which they are in this case.

Now, let's think about a case where the program says 'YES' but it's actually 'NO'.

Is there any such case?

Suppose:

Array: [3,1,2,4]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based index 1), since 3 >1.

- new = [2,4]

- check_all_new: a[0]=3 >=2 and 3>=4? No, 3 < 4.

- So, it prints 'NO'.

But can we sort it with operations?

- Operation 1: x=[3], y=[1,2,4] -> y+x=[1,2,4,3]

- Operation 2: x=[1], y=[2,4,3] -> y+x=[2,4,3,1]

- Operation 3: x=[2], y=[4,3,1] -> y+x=[4,3,1,2]

- Operation 4: x=[4], y=[3,1,2] -> y+x=[3,1,2,4]

- Operation 5: x=[3], y=[1,2,4] -> y+x=[1,2,4,3]

- Operation 6: x=[1], y=[2,4,3] -> y+x=[2,4,3,1]

- And so on...

It seems like it's cycling through permutations without reaching a sorted array.

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

Another case:

Array: [1,3,2]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=3 (0-based index 2), since 3 >2.

- new = [2]

- check_all_new: a[0]=1 >=2? No.

- So, it prints 'NO'.

But can we sort it?

- Operation 1: x=[1], y=[3,2] -> y+x=[3,2,1]

- Operation 2: x=[3], y=[2,1] -> y+x=[2,1,3]

- Operation 3: x=[2], y=[1,3] -> y+x=[1,3,2]

- Operation 4: x=[1], y=[3,2] -> y+x=[3,2,1]

- Can't reach [1,2,3]

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

Wait, but according to the problem, we can perform the operation any number of times. So, maybe there's a way to sort it with more operations.

But in this case, it seems not possible.

Now, let's think about a case where the program says 'NO' but it's actually 'YES'.

Is there such a case?

Suppose:

Array: [2,3,1]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based index 1), since 3 >1.

- new = [1]

- check_all_new: a[0]=2 >=1? Yes.

- new_all: [1] is sorted. Yes.

- So, it prints 'YES'.

Wait, but earlier I thought that [2,3,1] can't be sorted with the operation.

But according to the program, it should print 'YES'.

Is there a way to sort [2,3,1] with the operation?

Let's try:

- Original: [2,3,1]

- Operation 1: x=[2], y=[3,1] -> y+x=[3,1,2]

- Operation 2: x=[3], y=[1,2] -> y+x=[1,2,3]

- Sorted!

So, indeed, it can be sorted with two operations.

Hence, the program is correct in this case.

Another case:

Array: [4,2,3,1]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based index 1), since 4 >2.

- new = [3,1]

- check_all_new: a[0]=4 >=3 and 4>=1. Yes.

- new_all: [3,1] is not sorted. So, 'NO'.

Hence, it prints 'NO'.

But can we sort it with operations?

- Operation 1: x=[4], y=[2,3,1] -> y+x=[2,3,1,4]

- Operation 2: x=[2], y=[3,1,4] -> y+x=[3,1,4,2]

- Operation 3: x=[3], y=[1,4,2] -> y+x=[1,4,2,3]

- Operation 4: x=[1], y=[4,2,3] -> y+x=[4,2,3,1]

- Operation 5: x=[4], y=[2,3,1] -> y+x=[2,3,1,4]

- And so on...

It seems like it's cycling through permutations without reaching a sorted array.

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

Wait, but according to the program, it prints 'NO' because new_all is False.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Now, let's consider an array where multiple splits are possible.

Array: [1,3,2,4]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based index 1), since 3 >2.

- new = [2,4]

- check_all_new: a[0]=1 >=2? No.

- So, it prints 'NO'.

Which is correct, as we've seen earlier.

Another case:

Array: [1,2,3,2]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=4 (0-based index 3), since 3 >2.

- new = [2]

- check_all_new: a[0]=1 >=2? No.

- So, it prints 'NO'.

Which is correct, as sorting this array would require the last 2 to come before 3, which seems impossible with the given operation.

Alright, so up to this point, the program seems to be correctly identifying whether the array can be sorted with the given operation.

But I need to make sure that there are no edge cases where the program fails.

Let me consider an array with duplicate elements.

Array: [1,2,1,2]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=3 (0-based index 2), since 1 >1? No, equal is okay.

- Wait, non-decreasing allows equal elements.

- So, in this case, it's already sorted.

- Wait, but 1 <=2 <=1? No, 2 >=1 is true.

Wait, non-decreasing means each element is less than or equal to the next.

So, [1,2,1,2] is not sorted because 2 >1 at positions 2 and 3.

So, the program would:

- check_all: 1 <=2 <=1 <=2? No, because 2 >1.

- So, it's not sorted.

- Find first i where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=3 (0-based 2), since 2 >1.

- new = [1,2]

- check_all_new: a[0]=1 >=1 and 1>=2? No, 1 <2.

- So, prints 'NO'.

Is there a way to sort [1,2,1,2] with the operation?

- Operation 1: x=[1], y=[2,1,2] -> y+x=[2,1,2,1]

- Operation 2: x=[2], y=[1,2,1] -> y+x=[1,2,1,2]

- Operation 3: x=[1], y=[2,1,2] -> y+x=[2,1,2,1]

- Operation 4: x=[2], y=[1,2,1] -> y+x=[1,2,1,2]

- And so on...

It seems like it's cycling between these permutations without reaching [1,1,2,2], which is the sorted array.

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

Another case with duplicates:

Array: [2,2,1,1]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=3 (0-based 2), since 2 >1.

- new = [1,1]

- check_all_new: a[0]=2 >=1 and 2>=1. Yes.

- new_all: [1,1] is sorted. Yes.

- So, prints 'YES'.

But can we sort it?

- Operation 1: x=[2,2], y=[1,1] -> y+x=[1,1,2,2]

- Sorted!

Hence, 'YES' is correct.

Another case:

Array: [3,1,2,4,5]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based 1), since 3 >1.

- new = [2,4,5]

- check_all_new: a[0]=3 >=2, 3>=4? No, 3 <4.

- So, prints 'NO'.

But can we sort it?

- Operation 1: x=[3], y=[1,2,4,5] -> y+x=[1,2,4,5,3]

- Operation 2: x=[1], y=[2,4,5,3] -> y+x=[2,4,5,3,1]

- Operation 3: x=[2], y=[4,5,3,1] -> y+x=[4,5,3,1,2]

- Operation 4: x=[4], y=[5,3,1,2] -> y+x=[5,3,1,2,4]

- And so on...

It doesn't seem possible to sort this array with the given operation.

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

Wait, but according to the program, it should print 'NO' because check_all_new is False.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Now, let's think about an array where multiple splits could lead to sorting.

Array: [4,5,1,2,3]

- As in an earlier example, it can be sorted by performing the operation twice.

Hence, the program correctly identifies it as 'YES'.

Another case:

Array: [1,3,2,4]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based 1), since 3 >2.

- new = [2,4]

- check_all_new: a[0]=1 >=2? No.

- So, prints 'NO'.

Which is correct, as we've seen earlier.

Wait, but in a previous thought, I considered [1,3,2,4] and thought about operations, and it seems 'NO' is correct.

But wait, perhaps there's a way to sort it with more operations.

Let's try:

- Original: [1,3,2,4]

- Operation 1: x=[1], y=[3,2,4] -> y+x=[3,2,4,1]

- Operation 2: x=[3], y=[2,4,1] -> y+x=[2,4,1,3]

- Operation 3: x=[2], y=[4,1,3] -> y+x=[4,1,3,2]

- Operation 4: x=[4], y=[1,3,2] -> y+x=[1,3,2,4]

- Operation 5: x=[1], y=[3,2,4] -> y+x=[3,2,4,1]

- Operation 6: x=[3], y=[2,4,1] -> y+x=[2,4,1,3]

- Operation 7: x=[2], y=[4,1,3] -> y+x=[4,1,3,2]

- And so on...

It seems like it's cycling through permutations without reaching [1,2,3,4].

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

Now, I need to think if there's any case where the program says 'YES' but it's actually 'NO', or vice versa.

Let me consider an array where the program says 'YES', but it's not possible to sort it.

Is there such a case?

Suppose:

Array: [2,1,3,4]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based 1), since 2 >1.

- new = [3,4]

- check_all_new: a[0]=2 >=3? No.

- So, prints 'NO'.

But can we sort it?

- Operation 1: x=[2], y=[1,3,4] -> y+x=[1,3,4,2]

- Operation 2: x=[1], y=[3,4,2] -> y+x=[3,4,2,1]

- Operation 3: x=[3], y=[4,2,1] -> y+x=[4,2,1,3]

- Operation 4: x=[4], y=[2,1,3] -> y+x=[2,1,3,4]

- Operation 5: x=[2], y=[1,3,4] -> y+x=[1,3,4,2]

- Operation 6: x=[1], y=[3,4,2] -> y+x=[3,4,2,1]

- And so on...

It seems like it's not possible to sort this array with the given operation.

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

Another case:

Array: [1,2,4,3]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=4 (0-based 3), since 4 >3.

- new = [3]

- check_all_new: a[0]=1 >=3? No.

- So, prints 'NO'.

Which is correct.

Wait, but perhaps there's a way to sort it.

- Operation 1: x=[1,2,4], y=[3] -> y+x=[3,1,2,4]

- Operation 2: x=[3], y=[1,2,4] -> y+x=[1,2,4,3]

- Operation 3: x=[1], y=[2,4,3] -> y+x=[2,4,3,1]

- Operation 4: x=[2], y=[4,3,1] -> y+x=[4,3,1,2]

- Operation 5: x=[4], y=[3,1,2] -> y+x=[3,1,2,4]

- And so on...

Can't seem to reach [1,2,3,4].

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

Now, let's consider an array where the program says 'YES'.

Array: [4,5,1,2,3]

- As before, it prints 'YES'.

- And indeed, it can be sorted with operations.

Hence, correct.

Wait, but is there any array where the program says 'YES' but it's actually impossible to sort it?

Let me think about an array where:

- It's not sorted.

- There exists an i where a[i-1] > a[i].

- For that i, new = a[i:], a[0] >= all in new, and new is sorted.

But in reality, it's impossible to sort it.

Is there such an array?

Suppose:

Array: [3,1,2]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based 1), since 3 >1.

- new = [2]

- check_all_new: a[0]=3 >=2? Yes.

- new_all: [2] is sorted. Yes.

- So, prints 'YES'.

- And indeed, as seen earlier, it can be sorted with operations.

Hence, correct.

Another case:

Array: [5,6,1,2,3,4]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=3 (0-based 2), since 6 >1.

- new = [1,2,3,4]

- check_all_new: a[0]=5 >=1,5>=2,5>=3,5>=4. All true.

- new_all: [1,2,3,4] is sorted. Yes.

- So, prints 'YES'.

- Can it be sorted?

- Operation 1: x=[5,6], y=[1,2,3,4] -> y+x=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

- Sorted!

Hence, correct.

Wait, but according to the problem, the split must be such that a = x + y, and then we set a := y + x.

So, in this case, x=[5,6], y=[1,2,3,4], and after swapping, we get [1,2,3,4,5,6], which is sorted.

Hence, 'YES' is correct.

Now, is there any array where the program says 'YES' but it's actually impossible to sort it?

Let me think about an array where:

- It's not sorted.

- There exists an i where a[i-1] > a[i].

- For that i, new = a[i:], a[0] >= all in new, and new is sorted.

- But, even after performing operations, it can't be sorted.

Is there such an array?

Suppose:

Array: [3,1,2,4]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based 1), since 3 >1.

- new = [2,4]

- check_all_new: a[0]=3 >=2 and 3>=4? No, 3 <4.

- So, prints 'NO'.

Which is correct, as we've seen earlier.

Wait, but according to the program, it would print 'NO' in this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider a different array.

Suppose:

Array: [4,1,2,3]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based 1), since 4 >1.

- new = [2,3]

- check_all_new: a[0]=4 >=2 and 4>=3. Yes.

- new_all: [2,3] is sorted. Yes.

- So, prints 'YES'.

- Can it be sorted?

- Operation 1: x=[4], y=[1,2,3] -> y+x=[1,2,3,4]

- Sorted!

Hence, correct.

Another case:

Array: [5,1,2,3,4]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based 1), since 5 >1.

- new = [2,3,4]

- check_all_new: a[0]=5 >=2,5>=3,5>=4. Yes.

- new_all: [2,3,4] is sorted. Yes.

- So, prints 'YES'.

- Can it be sorted?

- Operation 1: x=[5], y=[1,2,3,4] -> y+x=[1,2,3,4,5]

- Sorted!

Hence, correct.

Wait, but is there a case where a[0] >= all in new and new is sorted, but it's still impossible to sort the array?

Let me think about an array where:

- a[0] >= all in new.

- new is sorted.

- But, even after operations, it can't be sorted.

Is there such an array?

Suppose:

Array: [3,4,1,2]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=3 (0-based 2), since 4 >1.

- new = [1,2]

- check_all_new: a[0]=3 >=1 and 3>=2. Yes.

- new_all: [1,2] is sorted. Yes.

- So, prints 'YES'.

- Can it be sorted?

- Operation 1: x=[3,4], y=[1,2] -> y+x=[1,2,3,4]

- Sorted!

Hence, correct.

Another case:

Array: [4,5,2,3]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=3 (0-based 2), since 5 >2.

- new = [3]

- check_all_new: a[0]=4 >=3? Yes.

- new_all: [3] is sorted. Yes.

- So, prints 'YES'.

- Can it be sorted?

- Operation 1: x=[4,5], y=[2,3] -> y+x=[2,3,4,5]

- Sorted!

Hence, correct.

Wait, but in this case, new = [2,3], not [3]. Wait, in the program, new = a[i:], where i=3 (0-based 2), so a[2:] = [2,3].

- check_all_new: a[0]=4 >=2 and 4>=3. Yes.

- new_all: [2,3] is sorted. Yes.

- So, 'YES'.

- Which is correct.

Wait, in my earlier thought, I mistakenly thought new=[3], but it's [2,3].

Hence, it's correct.

Now, is there any case where the program says 'YES' but it's actually impossible to sort the array?

I'm having trouble finding such a case.

Let me consider an array where:

- a[0] >= all in new.

- new is sorted.

- But, due to some other constraint, it's impossible to sort the array.

Is there such an array?

Suppose:

Array: [3,1,2,5,4]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based 1), since 3 >1.

- new = [2,5,4]

- check_all_new: a[0]=3 >=2, 3>=5? No, 3 <5.

- So, prints 'NO'.

Which is correct, as it's impossible to sort this array with the given operation.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Wait, but what if:

Array: [4,1,2,3,5]

- Not sorted.

- First position where a[i-1] > a[i]: i=2 (0-based 1), since 4 >1.

- new = [2,3,5]

- check_all_new: a[0]=4 >=2,4>=3,4>=5? No, 4 <5.

- So, prints 'NO'.

But can it be sorted?

- Operation 1: x=[4], y=[1,2,3,5] -> y+x=[1,2,3,5,4]

- Operation 2: x=[1], y=[2,3,5,4] -> y+x=[2,3,5,4,1]

- Operation 3: x=[2], y=[3,5,4,1] -> y+x=[3,5,4,1,2]

- Operation 4: x=[3], y=[5,4,1,2] -> y+x=[5,4,1,2,3]

- Operation 5: x=[5], y=[4,1,2,3] -> y+x=[4,1,2,3,5]

- Operation 6: x=[4], y=[1,2,3,5] -> y+x=[1,2,3,5,4]

- And so on...

It seems like it's cycling through permutations without reaching [1,2,3,4,5].

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

So, I can't find a case where the program says 'YES' but it's actually 'NO'.

Similarly, in earlier examples, the program says 'NO' for cases that can't be sorted, which is correct.

Hence, I conclude that the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the array can be sorted with the given operation.

Therefore, the correctness is **True**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix, swapping them, and concatenating them back together.

### Approach
1. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - First, check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, print 'YES' immediately.

2. **Finding the First Discrepancy:**
   - If the array is not sorted, find the first position where `a[i-1] > a[i]`.

3. **Split and Check Conditions:**
   - Split the array into two parts at the found position.
   - Check two conditions for the split parts:
     - The first element of the original array should be greater than or equal to all elements in the new suffix part.
     - The new suffix part should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, print 'YES'; otherwise, print 'NO'.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
        else:
            # Find the first position where a[i-1] > a[i]
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    # Check if a[0] >= all in new and new is sorted
                    check_all_new = all(a[0] >= new[j] for j in range(len(new)))
                    new_all = all(new[j - 1] <= new[j] for j in range(1, len(new)))
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break

# Call the function to execute
func()
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
  - We use `all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n))` to check if the array is already sorted.

- **Finding the First Discrepancy:**
  - We iterate through the array to find the first position where `a[i-1] > a[i]`.

- **Split and Check Conditions:**
  - We split the array into two parts at the found position.
  - We check if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the new suffix part.
  - We also check if the new suffix part is sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - If both conditions are satisfied, it means the array can be sorted by performing the specified operation; otherwise, it cannot.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine whether the array can be sorted using the given operation, covering all edge cases and ensuring the correctness of the solution.
