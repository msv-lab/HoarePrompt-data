Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a provided problem description. I need to determine whether the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. If it does, I should print "True"; otherwise, "False". It's important to note that partially correct programs are considered incorrect. I have to analyze the source code thoroughly to ensure there are no missing logic or edge cases that the code isn't handling.

The problem description is quite involved. It involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for a series of excursions, given certain constraints about friendships among children. The program provided is supposed to solve this problem, and I need to verify if it does so correctly.

First, I need to make sure I understand the problem completely. There are n children, m pairs of friends with associated friendship values, and k excursions. For each excursion, the teacher randomly selects a pair of children. If the pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. The task is to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen, considering that friendship values can change over time.

The output should be this expected value expressed as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and then p * q^{-1} modulo (10^9 + 7).

Looking at the program, it seems to read multiple test cases, each with values n, m, and k, followed by m lines of friend pairs and their initial friendship values.

The program calculates sum_f, which is the sum of all friendship values. Then it calculates cn2, which is the combination n choose 2, representing the total number of possible pairs. It then computes p and q based on some formula and reduces them by their greatest common divisor before computing the result modulo M (10^9 + 7).

I need to verify if this approach correctly calculates the expected value as described in the problem.

First, I need to understand the mathematical approach behind the program.

The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen needs to be calculated, considering that friendship values can increase over time if friends are chosen.

This sounds like a problem involving linearity of expectation, where the total expected sum is the sum of the expected values for each excursion.

For each excursion, the expected friendship value of the chosen pair needs to be calculated.

However, since friendship values can increase over time, the expectation for each excursion depends on the history of previous selections.

This seems complex, and I need to see how the program handles this.

Looking back at the program, it calculates sum_f as the sum of initial friendship values. Then, p is calculated as 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1), and q as 2 * cn2 ** 2.

This seems suspicious to me because I don't see how this captures the dynamic nature of friendship values increasing over time.

Wait, perhaps the author has a different approach. Maybe they're using some formula derived from probability theory.

I need to verify if this formula correctly computes the expected sum.

Let me consider a simple case to test the program.

Take the second example from the input:

2 1 10

1 2 1

Here, n=2, m=1, k=10

There is only one pair of friends with friendship value starting at 1.

Each time this pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.

So, the friendship value at the time of each choice is:

1 for the first choice, 2 for the second, and so on up to 10.

The sum would be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55, which matches the output.

But wait, in this case, since there are only two children, every chosen pair is always the same pair, and their friendship value increases by 1 each time they are chosen.

So, the sum is indeed 55.

But in reality, for n=2, there is only one possible pair to choose, so in each excursion, the same pair is chosen, and their friendship value increases by 1 each time.

Hence, the sum is the sum of the first k natural numbers starting from the initial friendship value.

In this case, initial f=1, k=10, so sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55.

Now, looking at the program's calculation:

sum_f = 1

cn2 = 1 (since n=2, cn2=1)

p = 2 * 10 * 1 * 1 + 1 * 10 * 9 = 20 + 90 = 110

q = 2 * 1 * 1 = 2

gcd = 2

p = 110 / 2 = 55

q = 2 / 2 = 1

Then, 55 * 1^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7) = 55, which matches the output.

So, in this case, it works.

Now, consider the first example:

100 0 24

Here, n=100, m=0, k=24

Since m=0, there are no friend pairs, so all pairs have friendship value 0, and since no pairs are friends, their friendship values never increase.

Hence, the sum should be 0 for all k excursions, which matches the output.

Now, consider the third test case:

3 1 2

2 1 1

Here, n=3, m=1, k=2

Friend pair: 2 and 1, with f=1

Total possible pairs: 3 choose 2 = 3 pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)

Only (1,2) have a friendship value, starting at 1, and increases by 1 each time they are chosen.

For k=2 excursions, we need to find the expected sum of friendship values for the two chosen pairs.

Let's calculate this step by step.

First, for the first excursion, any pair is chosen with equal probability (1/3).

- If (1,2) is chosen, friendship value is 1, and for the second excursion, if (1,2) is chosen again, friendship value is 2, otherwise, it remains 1.

- If (1,3) or (2,3) is chosen, friendship value is 0, and no change for subsequent excursions.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of expectation.

The expected sum is the sum of expected friendship values for each excursion.

For the first excursion, the expected friendship value is:

(1 friendship value for pair (1,2) with probability 1/3) + (0 for other pairs with probability 2/3) = 1*(1/3) + 0*(2/3) = 1/3

For the second excursion, it's more complex because the friendship value can have increased.

If (1,2) was chosen in the first excursion, their friendship value is now 2.

But the choice is independent, so the probability that (1,2) is chosen again is still 1/3, with friendship value 2, and for other pairs, it's still 0.

Wait, but the problem says that the teacher chooses pairs independently each time.

Hence, for each excursion, the pair is chosen randomly and independently, and if the pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "If a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions."

So, the friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions, but only for the pair that was chosen.

Hence, in this case, for pair (1,2), each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

Other pairs have friendship value 0 and do not change.

Given that, for k=2 excursions, we need to calculate the expected sum of friendship values at the time of choosing each pair.

Let's enumerate all possibilities:

Case 1: (1,2) is chosen in both excursions.

Probability: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9

Friendship values:

First choice: f=1 (initial)

Second choice: f=2 (since they were chosen before)

Sum: 1 + 2 = 3

Case 2: (1,2) is chosen in the first excursion, and another pair in the second.

Probability: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9

Sum: 1 (first choice) + 0 (second choice) = 1

Case 3: Another pair in the first excursion, and (1,2) in the second.

Probability: (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9

Sum: 0 (first choice) + 1 (second choice) = 1

Case 4: Another pair in both excursions.

Probability: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9

Sum: 0 + 0 = 0

Now, the expected sum is:

(1/9)*3 + (2/9)*1 + (2/9)*1 + (4/9)*0 = 3/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 0 = 7/9

Hence, the expected sum is 7/9.

Now, according to the program's output, it's 777777784, which is 7/9 modulo (10^9 + 7).

Indeed, 7/9 modulo (10^9 + 7) is calculated as 7 * 9^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7).

9^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7) is 476190479, because 9 * 476190479 = 4285714311 ≡ 1 mod (10^9 + 7)

Hence, 7 * 476190479 = 3333333353 ≡ 777777784 mod (10^9 + 7)

So, the program's output matches the expected value for this case.

Now, let's consider the fourth test case:

5 2 4

1 2 25

3 2 24

Here, n=5, m=2, k=4

Friend pairs: (1,2) with f=25 and (3,2) with f=24

Total possible pairs: 5 choose 2 = 10 pairs

Only (1,2) and (3,2) have initial friendship values, others have 0.

This seems more complex, and I might not calculate it manually accurately, but the program's output is 40000020, which is supposed to be the expected sum modulo (10^9 + 7).

Assuming the program's output is correct for this case as well.

Now, to verify the general correctness of the program, I need to see if the approach used in the program correctly computes the expected sum for any input within the constraints.

Looking back at the program:

sum_f is the sum of initial friendship values.

cn2 is n choose 2.

p is calculated as 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)

q is calculated as 2 * cn2 ** 2

Then, p and q are divided by their gcd, and p * q^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7) is printed.

I need to understand if this formula accurately represents the expected sum.

From the examples, it seems to work, but I need to see if it's generally correct.

Let me try to derive the expected sum.

Given that pairs are chosen independently each time, and if a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent choices.

Each excursion chooses a pair uniformly at random from all possible pairs.

Let’s denote:

- Total number of possible pairs: cn2 = n choose 2

- Number of friend pairs: m

- Initial sum of friendship values of friend pairs: sum_f

For each excursion, a pair is chosen randomly, and if it's a friend pair, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

We need to calculate the expected sum of friendship values at the time of each choice over k excursions.

This seems like a problem where we need to account for the increases in friendship values due to being chosen in previous excursions.

This might involve calculating, for each friend pair, the expected number of times its friendship value is increased by 1 over the k excursions.

However, since the increases are dependent on when the pair is chosen, and choices are independent across excursions, this could be complex.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to compute the expected sum using linearity of expectation, considering the contribution of each friend pair to the total sum.

Let me consider the contribution of a single friend pair to the total expected sum.

For a friend pair with initial friendship value f, each time it's chosen, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent choices.

Hence, if it's chosen t times, its contribution to the sum is f + (k - t), because for each of the k excursions, its friendship value is f plus the number of times it has been chosen before that excursion.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me think in terms of the number of times a particular friend pair is chosen.

Let’s denote X_i as an indicator variable that is 1 if friend pair i is chosen in excursion j, and 0 otherwise.

Then, the friendship value for friend pair i at the time of choice in excursion j is f_i + (number of times it was chosen in previous excursions).

This seems complicated to model directly.

An alternative approach is to consider that for each friend pair, the expected increase in its friendship value per time it is chosen, and how that affects the total sum.

But I'm not sure.

Looking back at the program's approach:

p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)

q = 2 * cn2 ** 2

I need to see if this represents the expected sum correctly.

Wait, perhaps the expected sum can be expressed as sum over all k choices of the expected friendship value at the time of choice.

For each choice, the expected friendship value is the sum over all friend pairs of the expected friendship value for that pair at that choice, times the probability of choosing that pair.

Given that, perhaps the program has derived some formula based on that.

However, without a clear derivation, it's hard for me to verify its correctness.

Given that the program's output matches the provided examples, and considering that the problem is complex, I might conclude that the program is correct.

But to be thorough, I should try to think of edge cases that might break the program.

Edge Case 1: n=2, m=1, k=1

Here, only one friend pair, and one excursion.

The sum should be equal to the initial friendship value, since it's only chosen once.

Let's assume the initial friendship value is f.

According to the program:

sum_f = f

cn2 = 1

p = 2 * 1 * 1 * f + 1 * 1 * 0 = 2f

q = 2 * 1 * 1 = 2

gcd = 2

p = 2f / 2 = f

q = 2 / 2 = 1

So, the output is f * 1^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7) = f

Which matches the expected sum, since it's just f.

Edge Case 2: n=3, m=0, k=5

No friend pairs, so all pairs have friendship value 0, and nothing changes.

Expected sum should be 0.

According to the program:

sum_f = 0

cn2 = 3

p = 2 * 5 * 3 * 0 + 0 * 5 * 4 = 0

q = 2 * 3 * 3 = 18

gcd = 6

p = 0 / 6 = 0

q = 18 / 6 = 3

0 * 3^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7) = 0

Which matches expected sum of 0.

Edge Case 3: n=4, m=6 (all pairs are friends), k=3

Here, all pairs are friends, and sum_f is the sum of their initial friendship values.

This is a fully connected graph, and every pair is a friend pair.

This might be another test case to see if the program handles it correctly.

However, given that the program seems to work for the provided examples and the edge cases I thought of, I'm inclined to say that the program is correct.

I cannot find a specific input where the program would fail to produce the correct output based on the problem description.

Hence, my conclusion is that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]
