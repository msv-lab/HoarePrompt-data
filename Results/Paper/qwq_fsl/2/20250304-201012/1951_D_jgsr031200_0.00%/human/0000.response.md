Alright, I have this task to verify the correctness of a given Python program based on a problem description. The program is supposed to help Bob set up stalls with specific pricing so that Alice buys exactly k jewels with n coins. The program needs to output "YES" if it's possible to set up at most 60 stalls with prices between 1 and 10^18 coins such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, and "NO" otherwise. If "YES", it should also specify the number of stalls and their prices.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as possible with her remaining coins. So, for each stall, she buys floor(remaining_coins / price_per_jewel) jewels and updates her remaining coins accordingly.

The program provided seems to handle this by checking if n equals k, in which case it sets up a single stall with price 1, because Alice would buy n jewels, each costing 1 coin, totaling n jewels. If n is less than k, it's impossible because Alice can't buy more jewels than the coins she has if each jewel costs at least 1 coin. So, in that case, it prints "NO".

For other cases, it sets up two stalls with prices [n - k + 1, 1]. It then calculates how many jewels Alice would buy from these two stalls and adjusts the remaining coins accordingly. If the total jewels bought are less than k, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES" and the prices.

I need to verify if this approach always works for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

Let me think about some test cases.

First, consider n = 7 and k = 3.

According to the program:

- n != k, so it sets up two stalls with prices [7 - 3 + 1, 1] = [5, 1].

- At the first stall, Alice buys floor(7 / 5) = 1 jewel, spending 5 coins, leaving her with 2 coins.

- At the second stall, she buys floor(2 / 1) = 2 jewels, spending 2 coins, leaving her with 0 coins.

- Total jewels bought: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k.

So, this seems correct.

Another test case: n = 6, k = 4.

- Set up stalls with prices [6 - 4 + 1, 1] = [3, 1].

- At first stall: floor(6 / 3) = 2 jewels, spends 6 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second stall: floor(0 / 1) = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 2 + 0 = 2, which is less than k=4.

- So, it should print "NO", which matches the sample output.

Another test case: n = 255, k = 8.

- Set up stalls with prices [255 - 8 + 1, 1] = [248, 1].

- At first stall: floor(255 / 248) = 1 jewel, spends 248 coins, leaves 7 coins.

- At second stall: floor(7 / 1) = 7 jewels, spends 7 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 7 = 8, which matches k=8.

This seems correct.

But, let's think about another case where k=1, n=1.

- n == k, so it sets up one stall with price 1, and Alice buys 1 jewel.

- Correct.

Another case: k=1, n=2.

- According to the program, it sets up stalls [2 - 1 + 1, 1] = [2, 1].

- At first stall: floor(2 / 2) = 1 jewel, spends 2 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second stall: floor(0 / 1) = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 1 + 0 = 1, which matches k=1.

Correct.

Another case: k=2, n=2.

- Set up stalls [2 - 2 + 1, 1] = [1, 1].

- At first stall: floor(2 / 1) = 2 jewels, spends 2 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second stall: floor(0 / 1) = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 2 + 0 = 2, which matches k=2.

Correct.

Wait, but in this case, setting up two stalls with price 1 each is unnecessary because with one stall of price 1, Alice would buy 2 jewels. But the program sets up two stalls. Is that acceptable?

According to the problem, it's allowed to set up more stalls even if fewer would suffice, as long as Alice buys exactly k jewels. So, this is still correct.

Let's consider a case where k is larger than n.

For example, k=5, n=3.

- n < k, so it prints "NO".

Correct, because each jewel costs at least 1 coin, so Alice can't buy more jewels than her coins.

Another case: k=3, n=6.

- Set up stalls [6 - 3 + 1, 1] = [4, 1].

- At first stall: floor(6 / 4) = 1 jewel, spends 4 coins, leaves 2 coins.

- At second stall: floor(2 / 1) = 2 jewels, spends 2 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k=3.

Correct.

Wait, but what if k=3, n=4.

- Set up stalls [4 - 3 + 1, 1] = [2, 1].

- At first stall: floor(4 / 2) = 2 jewels, spends 4 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second stall: floor(0 / 1) = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 2 + 0 = 2, which is less than k=3.

- So, it should print "NO".

Is there a way to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels with 4 coins?

Let's try setting up three stalls: [1,1,1].

- At first stall: floor(4 / 1) = 4 jewels, spends 4 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- But that's 4 jewels, which is more than k=3.

- Not acceptable.

Alternatively, [2,1].

- As above, 2 jewels from first stall, 0 from second. Total 2 jewels.

- No good.

Alternatively, [3,1].

- First stall: floor(4 / 3) = 1 jewel, spends 3 coins, leaves 1 coin.

- Second stall: floor(1 / 1) = 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, still less than 3.

Alternatively, [1,2].

- First stall: floor(4 / 1) = 4 jewels, spends 4 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Second stall: floor(0 / 2) = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 4 + 0 = 4, more than k=3.

Not acceptable.

Seems like there's no way to make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels with 4 coins, so "NO" is correct.

Another case: k=4, n=6.

- Set up stalls [6 - 4 + 1, 1] = [3,1].

- At first stall: floor(6 / 3) = 2 jewels, spends 6 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second stall: floor(0 / 1) = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 2 + 0 = 2, which is less than k=4.

- So, it should print "NO".

Is there a way to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins?

Let's try [2,1].

- First stall: floor(6 / 2) = 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Second stall: floor(0 / 1) = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 3 + 0 = 3, less than 4.

Not enough.

Alternatively, [1,1].

- First stall: floor(6 / 1) = 6 jewels, spends 6 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Second stall: floor(0 / 1) = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 6 + 0 = 6, more than 4.

Not acceptable.

Alternatively, [3,2,1].

- First stall: floor(6 / 3) = 2 jewels, spends 6 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Second stall: floor(0 / 2) = 0 jewels.

- Third stall: floor(0 / 1) = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 2 + 0 + 0 = 2, less than 4.

Not enough.

Alternatively, [1,2,3].

- First stall: floor(6 / 1) = 6 jewels, spends 6 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Second and third stalls: 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 6, more than 4.

Not acceptable.

Seems like there's no way to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins, so "NO" is correct.

Wait, but according to the program, for k=4 and n=6, it sets up stalls [6-4+1,1] = [3,1], and Alice buys 2 jewels, which is less than 4, so it prints "NO". That's correct.

Another case: k=5, n=10.

- Set up stalls [10 - 5 + 1, 1] = [6,1].

- At first stall: floor(10 / 6) = 1 jewel, spends 6 coins, leaves 4 coins.

- At second stall: floor(4 / 1) = 4 jewels, spends 4 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 4 = 5, which matches k=5.

Correct.

Another case: k=10, n=10.

- n == k, so set up one stall with price 1.

- Alice buys 10 jewels, which matches k=10.

Correct.

Wait, but according to the program, it sets up one stall with price 1, which is correct.

Another case: k=10, n=15.

- Set up stalls [15 - 10 + 1, 1] = [6,1].

- At first stall: floor(15 / 6) = 2 jewels, spends 12 coins, leaves 3 coins.

- At second stall: floor(3 / 1) = 3 jewels, spends 3 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 2 + 3 = 5, which is less than k=10.

- So, it should print "NO".

Is there a way to set up more stalls to make Alice buy exactly 10 jewels with 15 coins?

Let's try setting up more stalls.

For example, [2,1].

- First stall: floor(15 / 2) = 7 jewels, spends 14 coins, leaves 1 coin.

- Second stall: floor(1 / 1) = 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 7 + 1 = 8, which is less than 10.

Not enough.

Alternatively, [1,1,1].

- First stall: floor(15 / 1) = 15 jewels, spends 15 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Second and third stalls: 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 15, more than 10.

Not acceptable.

Alternatively, [3,2,1].

- First stall: floor(15 / 3) = 5 jewels, spends 15 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Second and third stalls: 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 5, less than 10.

Not enough.

Alternatively, [4,2,1].

- First stall: floor(15 / 4) = 3 jewels, spends 12 coins, leaves 3 coins.

- Second stall: floor(3 / 2) = 1 jewel, spends 2 coins, leaves 1 coin.

- Third stall: floor(1 / 1) = 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5, less than 10.

Still not enough.

Seems like it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly 10 jewels with 15 coins, so "NO" is correct.

Another case: k=5, n=25.

- Set up stalls [25 - 5 + 1, 1] = [21,1].

- At first stall: floor(25 / 21) = 1 jewel, spends 21 coins, leaves 4 coins.

- At second stall: floor(4 / 1) = 4 jewels, spends 4 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 4 = 5, which matches k=5.

Correct.

Wait, but what if k=5, n=20.

- Set up stalls [20 - 5 + 1, 1] = [16,1].

- At first stall: floor(20 / 16) = 1 jewel, spends 16 coins, leaves 4 coins.

- At second stall: floor(4 / 1) = 4 jewels, spends 4 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 4 = 5, which matches k=5.

Correct.

Another case: k=10, n=30.

- Set up stalls [30 - 10 + 1, 1] = [21,1].

- At first stall: floor(30 / 21) = 1 jewel, spends 21 coins, leaves 9 coins.

- At second stall: floor(9 / 1) = 9 jewels, spends 9 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 9 = 10, which matches k=10.

Correct.

Seems like the program's approach works for these cases.

But, is there any case where this approach fails?

Let me think about a case where k is large relative to n, but not larger than n.

For example, k=7, n=7.

- n == k, so set up one stall with price 1.

- Alice buys 7 jewels, which matches k=7.

Correct.

Another case: k=7, n=8.

- Set up stalls [8 - 7 + 1, 1] = [2,1].

- At first stall: floor(8 / 2) = 4 jewels, spends 8 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second stall: floor(0 / 1) = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 4 + 0 = 4, which is less than k=7.

- So, it should print "NO".

Is there a way to set up more stalls to make Alice buy exactly 7 jewels with 8 coins?

Let's try [1,1].

- First stall: floor(8 / 1) = 8 jewels, spends 8 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Second stall: floor(0 / 1) = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 8, which is more than 7.

Not acceptable.

Alternatively, [2,1].

- As above, 4 + 0 = 4 jewels.

Not enough.

Alternatively, [1,2].

- First stall: floor(8 / 1) = 8 jewels, spends 8 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Second stall: floor(0 / 2) = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 8, more than 7.

Not acceptable.

Seems like it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly 7 jewels with 8 coins, so "NO" is correct.

Another case: k=10, n=100.

- Set up stalls [100 - 10 + 1, 1] = [91,1].

- At first stall: floor(100 / 91) = 1 jewel, spends 91 coins, leaves 9 coins.

- At second stall: floor(9 / 1) = 9 jewels, spends 9 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 9 = 10, which matches k=10.

Correct.

Wait, but what if k=100, n=100.

- n == k, set up one stall with price 1.

- Alice buys 100 jewels, which matches k=100.

Correct.

Another case: k=1, n=100.

- Set up stalls [100 - 1 + 1, 1] = [100,1].

- At first stall: floor(100 / 100) = 1 jewel, spends 100 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second stall: floor(0 / 1) = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 1 + 0 = 1, which matches k=1.

Correct.

Seems like the program handles these cases correctly.

But, is there any case where the program's approach doesn't work?

Let me consider a case where k is very small compared to n.

For example, k=2, n=1000000000000000000.

- Set up stalls [1000000000000000000 - 2 + 1, 1] = [1000000000000000000 -1, 1].

- At first stall: floor(n / p1), where p1 is almost n.

- Suppose p1 = n -1, so floor(n / (n-1)) = 1 jewel, spends n-1 coins, leaves 1 coin.

- At second stall: floor(1 / 1) = 1 jewel, spends 1 coin, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k=2.

Correct.

Another case: k=3, n=1000000000000000000.

- Set up stalls [1000000000000000000 - 3 +1,1] = [1000000000000000000 -2,1].

- At first stall: floor(n / (n-2)) = 1 jewel, spends n-2 coins, leaves 2 coins.

- At second stall: floor(2 / 1) = 2 jewels, spends 2 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k=3.

Correct.

Seems like it works for large values as well.

Wait, but what if k=1, n=2.

- Set up stalls [2 -1 +1,1] = [2,1].

- At first stall: floor(2 / 2) = 1 jewel, spends 2 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second stall: floor(0 / 1) = 0 jewels.

- Total jewels: 1 + 0 =1, which matches k=1.

Correct.

Another case: k=2, n=3.

- Set up stalls [3 -2 +1,1] = [2,1].

- At first stall: floor(3 / 2) = 1 jewel, spends 2 coins, leaves 1 coin.

- At second stall: floor(1 / 1) =1 jewel, spends 1 coin, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels:1 +1=2, which matches k=2.

Correct.

Another case: k=3, n=4.

- Set up stalls [4 -3 +1,1] = [2,1].

- At first stall: floor(4 / 2) =2 jewels, spends 4 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second stall: floor(0 /1)=0 jewels.

- Total jewels:2 +0=2, which is less than k=3.

- So, it should print "NO".

Is there a way to set up more stalls to make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels with 4 coins?

Let's try [1,1,1].

- At first stall: floor(4 /1)=4 jewels, spends 4 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second and third stalls: floor(0 /1)=0 jewels.

- Total jewels:4 +0 +0=4, which is more than 3.

Not acceptable.

Alternatively, [2,1,1].

- At first stall: floor(4 /2)=2 jewels, spends 4 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second and third stalls: floor(0 /1)=0 jewels.

- Total jewels:2 +0 +0=2, less than 3.

Not enough.

Alternatively, [3,1,1].

- At first stall: floor(4 /3)=1 jewel, spends 3 coins, leaves 1 coin.

- At second stall: floor(1 /1)=1 jewel, spends 1 coin, leaves 0 coins.

- At third stall: floor(0 /1)=0 jewels.

- Total jewels:1 +1 +0=2, less than 3.

Still not enough.

Seems like it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels with 4 coins, so "NO" is correct.

Another case: k=4, n=5.

- Set up stalls [5 -4 +1,1] = [2,1].

- At first stall: floor(5 /2)=2 jewels, spends 4 coins, leaves 1 coin.

- At second stall: floor(1 /1)=1 jewel, spends 1 coin, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels:2 +1=3, which is less than k=4.

- So, it should print "NO".

Is there a way to set up more stalls to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with 5 coins?

Let's try [1,1,1].

- At first stall: floor(5 /1)=5 jewels, spends 5 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second and third stalls: floor(0 /1)=0 jewels.

- Total jewels:5 +0 +0=5, which is more than 4.

Not acceptable.

Alternatively, [2,1,1].

- At first stall: floor(5 /2)=2 jewels, spends 4 coins, leaves 1 coin.

- At second stall: floor(1 /1)=1 jewel, spends 1 coin, leaves 0 coins.

- At second and third stalls: floor(0 /2)=0 jewels.

- Total jewels:5 +0 +0=5, more than 4.

Not acceptable.

Seems like it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with 5 coins, so "NO" is correct.

Wait, but what if we set up more stalls?

For example, [1,1,1,1].

- At first stall: floor(5 /1)=5 jewels, spends 5 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second, third, and fourth stalls: floor(0 /1)=0 jewels.

- Total jewels:5 +0 +0 +0=5, still more than 4.

Not acceptable.

- At third stall: floor(1 /1)=1 jewel, spends 1 coin, leaves 0 coins.

- Total jewels:2 +0 +1=3, less than 4.

Not enough.

Seems like no configuration works, so "NO" is correct.

- At first stall: floor(6 /2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, leaves 0 coins.

Let's try [1,1,1].

- At first stall: floor(5 /1)=5 jewels, spends 5 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second and third stalls: floor(0 /1)=0 jewels.

- Total jewels:5 +0 +0=5, more than 4.

Not acceptable.

Alternatively, [2,1,1].

- At first stall: floor(5 /2)=2 jewels, spends 4 coins, leaves 1 coin.

- At second stall: floor(1 /1)=1 jewel, spends 1 coin, leaves 0 coins.

- At third stall: floor(0 /1)=0 jewels.

- Total jewels:2 +1 +0=3, less than 4.

Not enough.

Alternatively, [1,2,1].

- At first stall: floor(5 /1)=5 jewels, spends 5 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second and third stalls: floor(0 /2)=0 jewels.

- Total jewels:5 +0 +0=5, more than 4.

Not acceptable.

Seems like "NO" is correct.

Another case: k=5, n=6.

- Set up stalls [6 -5 +1,1] = [2,1].

- At first stall: floor(6 /2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, leaves 0 coins.

- At second stall: floor(0 /1)=0 jewels.

- Total jewels:3 +0=3, less than k=5.

- So, it should print "NO".

Is there a way to set up more stalls to make Alice buy exactly 5 jewels with 6 coins?
