Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. The issue lies in the logic used to decode the string. According to the problem description, the encoding process involves creating a string `r` of distinct characters from `s` in alphabetical order and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`. To decode, you need to reverse this process, which means you should create the same string `r` and then map each character in the encoded string back to its original character based on the symmetric positions in `r`.

However, the function `func_1` in the provided program does not follow this logic. Instead, it creates a mapping where each unique character in the encoded string is mapped to a unique lowercase Latin letter starting from 'a'. This is not the correct way to decode the string, as it does not consider the symmetric positions in the string `r`.

For example, if the encoded string is "serofedsoc", the correct string `r` would be "cdefors". The function should map 's' to 'c', 'e' to 'o', 'r' to 'd', and so on, based on their symmetric positions in `r`. The provided function, however, would map 's' to 'a', 'e' to 'b', 'r' to 'c', and so on, which is incorrect.

To correctly decode the string, the function should:
1. Construct the string `r` from the encoded string by taking all distinct characters and sorting them alphabetically.
2. Create a mapping where each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.
3. Use this mapping to construct the decoded string.

Given this, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
