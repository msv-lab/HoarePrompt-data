You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Program:

                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break

    return ''.join(decoded)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. The decoded string is generated by mapping each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, starting from 'a' and incrementing. The final state of the program includes a dictionary `mapping` that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, and the returned string is the decoded version of `encoded` based on this mapping.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem. The issue lies in the logic of `func_1` where it attempts to create a mapping from the encoded characters to the original characters. The program incorrectly maps each character in the encoded string to a unique character from 'a' to 'z' that has not been used yet, rather than using the symmetric mapping based on the distinct characters in the encoded string.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
10
serofedsoc
```
The expected output is "codeforces". However, the program will output a different string because it does not correctly handle the symmetric mapping. The correct approach should involve constructing the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters in the encoded string and then using this string to perform the symmetric replacement.

Here is a corrected version of the function for reference:
```python
def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Construct the auxiliary string r from distinct characters in alphabetical order
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    
    # Create a mapping from encoded characters to original characters
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Decode the string using the mapping
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

This corrected function would correctly decode the string "serofedsoc" to "codeforces". The original program fails to handle this and other similar cases correctly.
