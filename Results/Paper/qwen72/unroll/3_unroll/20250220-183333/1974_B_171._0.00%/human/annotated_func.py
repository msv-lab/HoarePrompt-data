    #State: Output State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, starting from 'a' and incrementing, `decoded` is a list of lowercase Latin letters that correspond to the characters in `encoded` based on the `mapping`.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string that is the decoded version of `encoded`, where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding lowercase Latin letter according to the `mapping` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. The decoded string is generated by mapping each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, starting from 'a' and incrementing. The final state of the program includes a dictionary `mapping` that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, and the returned string is the decoded version of `encoded` based on this mapping.
