Reasoning:  
The program provided does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The problem specifies that the encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with all distinct letters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`. To decode, you need to reverse this process: create the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters in the encoded string, and then replace each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character in `r`.

However, the function `func_1` in the provided program does not follow this logic. Instead, it creates a mapping from each character in the encoded string to a unique lowercase letter starting from 'a'. This is incorrect because it does not consider the auxiliary string `r` and the symmetric replacement rule.

To correctly decode the string, the function should:
1. Identify all distinct characters in the encoded string and sort them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
2. Create a mapping where the first character of `r` maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.
3. Replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character in the original string based on this mapping.

Given this, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
