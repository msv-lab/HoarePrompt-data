Precondition: **Each test case consists of six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
