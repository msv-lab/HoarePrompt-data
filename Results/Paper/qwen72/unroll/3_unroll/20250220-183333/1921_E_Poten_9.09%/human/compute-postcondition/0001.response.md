Output State: **`test_cases` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, each test case consists of six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `answers` is an empty list.**
