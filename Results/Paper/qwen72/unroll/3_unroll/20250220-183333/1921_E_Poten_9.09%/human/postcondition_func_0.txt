The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` and determines the winner of a game based on the positions of two points `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` within a grid of height `h` and width `w`. The function appends the result ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') to a list `answers` and prints each result in the list after all test cases have been processed. The final state of the program is that the `answers` list contains the results for all test cases, and these results have been printed to the console.
