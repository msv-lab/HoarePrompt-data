The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then checks if the number of elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` is at least `k // 2`. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.
