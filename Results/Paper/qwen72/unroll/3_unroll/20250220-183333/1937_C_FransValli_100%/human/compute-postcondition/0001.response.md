Output State: **The loop will output the indices (maxi, mini) for each test case, where maxi and mini are the indices in the permutation p such that p_maxi âŠ• p_mini is maximized. The variables n, maxi, arr, and mini will be updated for each test case, but their final values will be specific to the last test case processed.**
