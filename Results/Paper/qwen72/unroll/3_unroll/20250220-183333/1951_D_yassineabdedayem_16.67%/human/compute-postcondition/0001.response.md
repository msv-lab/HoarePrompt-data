The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already defined as an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**
