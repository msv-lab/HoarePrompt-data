You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        rep = 0
        
        number = 0
        
        tab = []
        
        while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
            Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
            if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
                number = Min
                k = k - Max
            else:
                number = Max
                k = k - Min
            tab.append(str(number))
            n -= Min * Max
            rep += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(len(tab))
            for i in tab:
                print(i, end=' ')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. After the loop, t is decremented by the number of test cases processed, and for each test case, n is reduced by the sum of products of Min and Max calculated in each iteration, and k is reduced by the sum of Min and Max values used in each iteration. The loop will print 'YES' followed by the length of the tab list and the elements of tab if k is reduced to 0, otherwise it will print 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), and returns a result for each test case. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
