To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the condition `n >= min(p)`. The variables in the loop head are `n` and `p`.

1. **Variable `n`**: It is given that `n` is a non-negative integer. This means `n` can be 0 or any positive integer.
2. **Variable `p`**: It is given that `p` is a list of integers such that each element `p[i]` is between 1 and 100, and `p` is sorted in increasing order. Therefore, `min(p)` will be the first element of the list, which is at least 1.

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to the smallest element in `p`. Since `min(p)` is at least 1, `n` must be at least 1 to satisfy the condition `n >= min(p)`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and must be at least 1, `p` is a list of integers such that 1 <= p[i] <= 100 and p is sorted in increasing order**
