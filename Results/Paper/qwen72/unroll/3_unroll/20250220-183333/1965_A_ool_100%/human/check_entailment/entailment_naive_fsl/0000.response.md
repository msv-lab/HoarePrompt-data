Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all piles have the same number of stones correctly. According to the problem description, if all piles have the same number of stones, Alice can win by choosing \( k \) equal to the number of stones in each pile, which will empty all piles in one move. However, the program's logic does not account for this scenario properly. For example, if the input is:

```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```

The program will return "Alice" because the smallest pile size is not 1, and it does not check if all pile sizes are the same. In this specific case, Alice should indeed win, but the program's logic is flawed and does not correctly identify the win condition for all cases. For instance, if the input is:

```
1
3
1 2 3
```

The program will return "Alice", which is correct. However, if the input is:

```
1
2
1 7
```

The program will return "Bob", which is also correct. But the logic is not robust enough to handle all edge cases, such as when all piles have the same number of stones. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
