Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program provided follows the problem description correctly for every potential case. Here is a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is done correctly in `func_2`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: In `func_1`, the program calculates the prefix sums of zeros and ones up to each house. This is stored in the list `S`, where `S[i]` contains the number of zeros and ones up to the i-th house. This is done correctly using a loop.

3. **Condition Checking**: The program iterates through each possible position to place the road (from 0 to n). For each position `i`, it checks:
   - The number of zeros on the left side (`left`) is at least half of the number of houses on the left side (`lsum`).
   - The number of ones on the right side (`right`) is at least half of the number of houses on the right side (`rsum`).

4. **Optimal Position Selection**: The program selects the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)` while satisfying the conditions. This ensures that the road is as close to the middle of the village as possible.

5. **Output**: The program prints the optimal position for each test case, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. For example:
- If the road is placed before the first house (`i = 0`), it correctly checks the condition for the right side.
- If the road is placed after the last house (`i = n`), it correctly checks the condition for the left side.
- For any other position `i`, it correctly checks the conditions for both sides.

Given the thorough handling of all potential cases and the correct implementation of the logic, the program is correct.
