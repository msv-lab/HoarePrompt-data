### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input Reading**: The function reads an integer `n` and a string `a` from the user. This is consistent with the problem description.
   - **Cumulative Counts**: It constructs a list `S` where each element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's up to that point in the string `a`. This is a good approach to keep track of the number of residents who want to live on the left and right sides.
   - **Condition Checking**: The function iterates through all possible positions `i` (from 0 to `n`) to place the road. For each position, it checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the left segment and if the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the right segment. This is done using the conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum`.
   - **Optimal Position Selection**: The function updates the answer `ans` to the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)`. This ensures that the road is as close to the middle of the village as possible while satisfying the conditions.
   - **Output**: The function prints the optimal position `ans` for the road.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Test Case Handling**: The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. It then calls `func_1` for each test case, which is consistent with the problem description.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating `t` times and calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
- **Function `func_1`**: The function correctly processes the input and checks the conditions for placing the road. It also selects the optimal position based on the criteria given in the problem.
- **Function `func_2`**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program appears to be correct and meets all the requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
