The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `n`. `a` is a list of positive integers where the length of `a` is between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive). `n` is a positive integer that is equal to the length of `a`.

The function returns an integer based on the following cases:
- Case_1: The function returns the integer 1.
- Case_2: The function returns the integer 1.
- Case_3: The function returns the integer 2.
- Case_4: The function returns the integer 1.
- Case_5: The function returns the integer 2.

Since the cases provided are not mutually exclusive and do not specify the conditions under which each case is triggered, the function appears to always return either 1 or 2, but the exact conditions for each return value are not clear from the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of positive integers and an integer `n` where `n` is the length of `a`. It returns either the integer 1 or the integer 2, but the specific conditions for each return value are not provided.**
