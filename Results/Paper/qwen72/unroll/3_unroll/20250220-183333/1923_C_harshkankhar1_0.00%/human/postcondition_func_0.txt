The function `func_1` reads input from the user, expecting the first line to contain two integers `n` and `q`, representing the length of an array and the number of queries, respectively. It then reads the next line to populate an array `a` of length `n + 1` (with an extra 0 at the beginning). The function computes a new array `b` of the same length, where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of 1 or 2 based on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1. The function then computes the cumulative sum of the original array `a` and prints it. For each of the `q` queries, it reads a pair of integers `x` and `y`, and prints 'NO' if the difference in cumulative sums of `a` and `b` between indices `x` and `y` is less than zero or if `x` equals `y`; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value.
