Output State: **`n` remains the same input integer, `q` remains the same input integer, `a` is now a list of cumulative sums of the original `a`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of 1 or 2 based on the condition `a[i] > 1`, and `c` remains the same list. Each query `l_i` and `r_i` remains the same.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `q` remains unchanged.
- The list `a` is now updated to be the cumulative sum of its original values. For example, if `a` was initially `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, it will now be `[1, 3, 6, 10]`.
- The list `b` remains the same, as it is not affected by the code snippet.
- The list `c` remains unchanged.
- The queries `l_i` and `r_i` remain the same.
