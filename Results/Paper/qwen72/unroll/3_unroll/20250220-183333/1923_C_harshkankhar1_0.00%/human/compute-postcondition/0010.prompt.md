You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description indicates that the function should handle multiple test cases, each with an array `c` of length `n` and `q` queries. The actual function should take parameters for the number of test cases, the array `c`, and the queries. Each element of `c` is a positive integer, and each query is a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`. The function should be defined to accept these inputs.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` remains the same input integer, `q` remains the same input integer, `a` remains the same list, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of 1 or 2 based on the condition `a[i] > 1`, and `c` remains the same list. Each query `l_i` and `r_i` remains the same.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] (where each element is the cumulative sum of the original `a` list up to that index)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The loop will print 'NO' or 'YES' for each query `(l_i, r_i)` based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is intended to accept parameters for the number of test cases, an array `c` of positive integers, and a list of queries, each query being a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`. For each query, the function returns a result based on the elements of the array `c` between indices `l_i` and `r_i`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
