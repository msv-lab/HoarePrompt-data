The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with an array `c` of length `n` and a list of `q` queries. Each element of `c` is a positive integer, and each query is a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`. The function should accept the number of test cases, the array `c`, and the list of queries as parameters. However, the provided function signature `def func_1():` does not include these parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description.

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept parameters for the number of test cases, an array `c` of positive integers, and a list of queries, each query being a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`. For each query, the function returns a result based on the elements of the array `c` between indices `l_i` and `r_i`.**
