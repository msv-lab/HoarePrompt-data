### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should accept parameters for the number of test cases, the array `c`, and the queries.
   - However, the program reads the inputs directly within the function, which is a common practice in competitive programming. This is not a functional error but a design choice.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The array `a` is initialized with an extra leading zero to handle 1-based indexing, which is correct.
   - The array `b` is also initialized with an extra leading zero, which is correct.

3. **Construction of Array `b`:**
   - The array `b` is constructed such that `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of 1 or 2 based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. This is intended to ensure that `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] != b[i]` for every index `i`.
   - The logic `x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2` ensures that if `a[i]` is 1, `b[i]` will be 2, and if `a[i]` is greater than 1, `b[i]` will be 1. This is a valid approach to ensure `a[i] != b[i]` and `b[i] > 0`.

4. **Cumulative Sum of Array `a`:**
   - The array `a` is converted to its cumulative sum using `accumulate(a)`. This is correct and necessary for efficient range sum queries.

5. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray `a[y] - a[x - 1]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b` (`b[y] - b[x - 1]`).
   - Additionally, it checks if `x == y`, which is a valid condition to ensure that the subarray is not a single element (since a single element cannot be transformed into a different positive integer).

6. **Condition for Good Subarray:**
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` is intended to ensure that the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`. This is a valid approach because if the sum of `a` is less than the sum of `b`, it implies that there is a way to transform `a` into `b` such that `a_i != b_i` for all `i` and `b_i > 0` for all `i`.
   - The condition `x == y` is also valid because a single element subarray cannot be transformed into a different positive integer.

7. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     5 4
     1 2 1 4 5
     1 5
     4 4
     3 4
     1 3
     ```
   - The arrays `a` and `b` are constructed as follows:
     - `a = [0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 13]` (cumulative sum of the input array)
     - `b = [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8]` (cumulative sum of the transformed array)
   - For the queries:
     - `1 5`: `a[5] - a[0] = 13`, `b[5] - b[0] = 8` → `13 < 8` is false, and `1 != 5` → Output: `YES`
     - `4 4`: `a[4] - a[3] = 4`, `b[4] - b[3] = 1` → `4 < 1` is false, and `4 == 4` → Output: `NO`
     - `3 4`: `a[4] - a[2] = 4`, `b[4] - b[2] = 3` → `4 < 3` is false, and `3 != 4` → Output: `YES`
     - `1 3`: `a[3] - a[0] = 4`, `b[3] - b[0] = 5` → `4 < 5` is true, and `1 != 3` → Output: `NO`

   - The actual output matches the expected output, indicating that the program is correct in this case.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was incorrect. The program does correctly determine whether a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The logic used to construct the `b` array and the condition to check if the subarray is good are valid and effective.

Final: **True**
