#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description indicates that the function should handle multiple test cases, each with an array `c` of length `n` and `q` queries. The actual function should take parameters for the number of test cases, the array `c`, and the queries. Each element of `c` is a positive integer, and each query is a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`. The function should be defined to accept these inputs.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` remains the same input integer, `q` remains the same input integer, `a` remains the same list, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of 1 or 2 based on the condition `a[i] > 1`, and `c` remains the same list. Each query `l_i` and `r_i` remains the same.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] (where each element is the cumulative sum of the original `a` list up to that index)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The loop will print 'NO' or 'YES' for each query `(l_i, r_i)` based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the user, expecting the first line to contain two integers `n` and `q`, representing the length of an array and the number of queries, respectively. It then reads the next line to populate an array `a` of length `n + 1` (with an extra 0 at the beginning). The function computes a new array `b` of the same length, where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of 1 or 2 based on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1. The function then computes the cumulative sum of the original array `a` and prints it. For each of the `q` queries, it reads a pair of integers `x` and `y`, and prints 'NO' if the difference in cumulative sums of `a` and `b` between indices `x` and `y` is less than zero or if `x` equals `y`; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value.
