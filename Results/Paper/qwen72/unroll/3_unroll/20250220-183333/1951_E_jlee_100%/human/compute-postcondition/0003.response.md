The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `s` is a list of strings, where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters, and the length of each string is between 1 and 10^6. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases in `s`. The specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints, but it is implied that the function processes each string in `s` and returns a result based on some operation or condition applied to each string.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of strings `s`. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to one of the test cases in `s`.**
