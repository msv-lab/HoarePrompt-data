Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string is a palindrome but can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, the string "abba" is a palindrome, but it can be partitioned into "ab" and "ba", both of which are non-palindromic. The program incorrectly prints "NO" for such cases.

Here is the failing test case:
```
Input:
1
abba

Expected Output:
YES
2
ab ba

Actual Output:
NO
```
