Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for the problem described:

1. **Handling of Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies that a single character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO". This is correct.

2. **Handling of Strings with All Characters the Same**: The program correctly identifies that a string where all characters are the same cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO". This is correct.

3. **Handling of Strings with One Different Character**: The program attempts to handle strings where all but one character are the same, but it does not correctly identify when such a string can or cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, it incorrectly prints "NO" for the string "abaaa" when it should print "YES" with a valid partition.

4. **General Case Handling**: The program's logic for handling general cases is overly complex and does not always produce the correct output. For example, it fails to handle the case where the string has a structure that can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings but does not fit the specific conditions checked in the code.

5. **Simpler Solution**: A simpler and more effective approach would be to check if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings by ensuring that no substring of length 1 or 2 is a palindrome. If the string has at least two different characters, it can always be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings by splitting it into substrings of length 2 or more.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def partition_non_palindrome(s):
    n = len(s)
    if n == 1:
        return False, []
    if n == 2:
        return not is_palindrome(s), [s]
    
    # Check if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings
    for i in range(1, n):
        if not is_palindrome(s[:i]) and not is_palindrome(s[i:]):
            return True, [s[:i], s[i:]]
    
    return False, []

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input()
        possible, partition = partition_non_palindrome(string)
        if possible:
            print('YES')
            print(len(partition))
            print(' '.join(partition))
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version checks if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings by trying to split it at every possible position and verifying if both parts are non-palindromic. If such a partition is found, it prints "YES" along with the partition. Otherwise, it prints "NO".
