Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description indicates that the function should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function should be able to read input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by t lines, each containing one integer n. `n_cases` is an integer equal to the number of test cases t.**
