You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a number of test cases `t` from standard input, followed by `t` integers `n`. For each integer `n`, it prints either `1` if `n` is `1`, or the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n` if `n` is greater than `1`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input has been processed and the results have been printed to the standard output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. Each test case involves an integer `n` which represents the length of the array `a` where `a_i = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.

2. **Special Case Handling**: If `n` is 1, the array is `[1]` and no swaps are performed. Therefore, the position of 1 remains 1. This is correctly handled by the program.

3. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `n`**:
   - The program aims to find the position of 1 after performing the swap operations for each `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - The key insight is that the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` will determine the position of 1. This is because the swap operations will eventually move 1 to a position that is a power of 2.
   - The program uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` by incrementing `power` until `2 ** power` is greater than `n`.

4. **Handling the Power of 2 Case**:
   - If `n` itself is a power of 2, the position of 1 will be `2 ** power` because the swap operations will move 1 to the position of the next power of 2.
   - If `n` is not a power of 2, the position of 1 will be `2 ** (power - 1)` because the largest power of 2 less than `n` will be the final position of 1.

5. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The largest divisor of `k` that is not `k` itself is `k // 2` if `k` is even.
   - For odd `k`, the largest divisor is less than `k // 2` and will not affect the position of 1 in the same way.
   - The program correctly identifies that the position of 1 will be a power of 2, and it calculates this power of 2 based on the input `n`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is a power of 2 correctly by printing `2 ** power`.
   - For other values of `n`, it correctly prints `2 ** (power - 1)`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the position of 1 in the array after performing the swap operations. The reasoning and the implementation are sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
