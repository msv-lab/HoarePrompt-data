The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Each of the following `t` lines contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case and returns the result for each `n`.

Functionality: **The function reads a number of test cases `t` from stdin, followed by `t` integers `n`. For each integer `n`, it processes the value and returns the result.**
