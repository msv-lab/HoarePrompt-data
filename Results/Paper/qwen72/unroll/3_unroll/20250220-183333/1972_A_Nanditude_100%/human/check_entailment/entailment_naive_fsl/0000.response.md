Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial difficulties `a` are already greater than the expected difficulties `b` for some indices. The program simply increments the count `cnt` whenever `b[j] < a[i]`, but it does not actually insert new problems with the appropriate difficulty and sort the array as described in the problem statement. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```

The program will output `2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because:
1. Propose a problem with difficulty `w=800` and `a` becomes `[800, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200]`.
2. Propose a problem with difficulty `w=1500` and `a` becomes `[800, 1000, 1400, 1500, 2000, 2000]`.

However, the program does not handle the insertion and sorting of the new problems, leading to an incorrect result.
