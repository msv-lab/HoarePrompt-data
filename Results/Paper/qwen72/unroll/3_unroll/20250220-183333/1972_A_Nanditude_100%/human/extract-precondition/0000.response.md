Precondition: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `a` and `b` which are lists of integers, and `n` which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and both `a` and `b` are of length `n` and sorted in non-decreasing order.**
