#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `a` and `b` which are lists of integers, and `n` which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and both `a` and `b` are of length `n` and sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        for j in range(n):
            if b[j] < a[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. After processing, it will print the count of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a`. The variables `cnt` and `i` will be reset to 0 for each iteration of the loop. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged after each iteration, but they will be overwritten in the next iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two lists of integers `a` and `b` of length `n`, where both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function then counts the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` and prints this count. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are reset for each test case, and the function does not return any value.
