The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- The function is expected to handle multiple test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n.
- The total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

To ensure the loop executes, the input value must be a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The variable `_` is not relevant to the state before the loop starts, but it will be used to iterate through the range of test cases.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4)**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once, as `int(input())` will be a positive integer.
