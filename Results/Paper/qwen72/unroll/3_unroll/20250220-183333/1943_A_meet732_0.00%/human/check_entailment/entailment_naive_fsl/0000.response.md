Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the optimal play for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, the logic for determining the final MEX score is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the MEX score can be determined by counting the occurrences of each number and then adjusting a counter `c` based on these counts. This approach does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The array `a` is `[0, 1, 2, 2, 3]`.
- Alice and Bob will play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX score, respectively.
- Alice can start by picking `2`, so `c` becomes `[2]` and `a` becomes `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.
- Bob can then pick `0`, so `a` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
- Alice can pick `1`, so `c` becomes `[2, 1]` and `a` becomes `[2, 3]`.
- Bob can pick `2`, so `a` becomes `[3]`.
- Alice can pick `3`, so `c` becomes `[2, 1, 3]` and `a` becomes `[]`.

At the end, `c` is `[2, 1, 3]`, and the MEX of `c` is `4` because `0` and `1` are in `c`, but `4` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`.

The program, however, outputs `2` because it incorrectly handles the logic for determining the MEX score. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
