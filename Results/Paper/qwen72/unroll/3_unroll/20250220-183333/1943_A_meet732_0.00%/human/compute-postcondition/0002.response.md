The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The function also accepts a parameter `t`, a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4), representing the total number of test cases. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters `n` and `a`. However, the specific return value is not provided in the constraints and relationships, so we cannot describe the exact output without additional information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a total number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts `n` (a positive integer) and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters `n` and `a`.**
