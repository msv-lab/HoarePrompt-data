### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The function initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It then iterates over the list `a` and increments the count for each integer in `cntl`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX 0**:
   - The function checks if the count of `0` in `cntl` is zero. If so, it prints `0` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if `0` is not in the array, the MEX of the array is `0`.

4. **Finding the MEX**:
   - If `0` is present in the array, the function initializes a variable `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is intended to handle the case where `0` appears more than once.
   - The function then iterates over the range from `1` to `n + 1` to find the smallest index `j` such that `cntl[j] < 2`.
   - If `cntl[j] < 2`, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` is zero or if `j` is the last index (`n`). If either condition is met, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The optimal strategy for both players is to ensure that the smallest possible integer that is not in the array `c` is the MEX.
   - The function correctly identifies the smallest integer `j` that appears less than twice in the array `a` and prints it as the MEX.

### Issues:
- The variable `c` is initialized to `min(2, cntl[0])`, which is unnecessary and can be simplified to `2` since `cntl[0]` will always be at least 1 if `0` is present in the array.
- The condition `if not c or j == n` is not optimal. The function should simply print the smallest `j` where `cntl[j] < 2` and break out of the loop.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cntl = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    print(j)
                    break
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is almost correct but has a minor issue in the logic for finding the MEX. The corrected version simplifies the logic and ensures that the smallest `j` where `cntl[j] < 2` is printed, which is the correct approach for the problem.

**Correctness: False** (due to the unnecessary and incorrect use of `c` and the condition `if not c or j == n`).
