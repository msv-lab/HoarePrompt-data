Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which specifies the number of time strings to process. For each of the `t` time strings in the format "hh:mm", it converts the time to a 12-hour format with AM/PM and prints the converted time. The function does not modify any external variables or state. **
