Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including the correct handling of AM and PM. It covers all possible hour values from 00 to 23 and ensures that the minutes are preserved as they are in the 24-hour format. The program also correctly handles the special cases for hours 00 and 12, converting them to 12 AM and 12 PM, respectively. The output format matches the required format exactly, with the time and AM/PM indicator separated by a space. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.
