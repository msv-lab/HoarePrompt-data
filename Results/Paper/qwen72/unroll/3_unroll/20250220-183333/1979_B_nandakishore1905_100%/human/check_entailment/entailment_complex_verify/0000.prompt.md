You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

    #State: The values of x and y remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The loop processes inputs n and m, and for each iteration, it prints a value based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The loop does not alter the initial state of x and y.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it reads an integer from the user, which determines the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `m` from the user, computes the absolute difference `k` between them, and prints a value based on the following conditions: if `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`; if `k` is odd, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` after subtracting all smaller powers of 2 from `k`. The function does not modify any external variables or the initial state of the program.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the length of the longest common subsegment is flawed. The program uses the absolute difference `k = abs(n - m)` and then checks if `k` is a power of two. If `k` is not a power of two and is even, it attempts to find the largest power of two less than `k` and subtracts it, repeating this process until `f & f - 1 == 0`. However, this approach does not always yield the correct length of the longest common subsegment.

For example, consider the input `x = 12` and `y = 4`. The correct output should be `8`, as the longest common subsegment is `[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]`. However, the program will output `4` in this case, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should consider the properties of the XOR operation and the periodicity of the sequences `a` and `b`. The length of the longest common subsegment can be determined by the highest power of 2 that divides the absolute difference `k = abs(x - y)`. This is because the sequences `a` and `b` will repeat their patterns every power of 2. The program should be modified to correctly implement this logic.
