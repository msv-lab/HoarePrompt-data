The function `func_2` reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the processed line. It does not take any parameters and does not modify any external variables. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a line of input has been read and stripped of trailing whitespace, and this line is returned to the caller.
