The function `func_6` does not have any parameters based on the provided function signature. However, the description mentions parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` which are integers with specific constraints, and lists `A`, `D`, and `F` with specific properties. Since these parameters are not part of the function signature, they are likely used internally or passed through other means (e.g., global variables or external context). The function's output is not specified, so it is unclear what the function returns. 

Given the constraints and relationships provided, if we assume these parameters are part of the function's context, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates with integers `n`, `m`, and `k` and lists `A`, `D`, and `F` with specific constraints and properties. The function's output is not specified, so its return value is unknown.**
