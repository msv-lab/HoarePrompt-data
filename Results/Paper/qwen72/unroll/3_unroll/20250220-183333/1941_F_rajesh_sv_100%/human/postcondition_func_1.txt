The function `wrapper` does not accept any parameters. It checks if a tuple `args` is present in a dictionary `d`. If `args` is not in `d`, it computes the result of `func(*args)` and stores it in `d` with `args` as the key. The function then returns the value associated with `args` in `d`. If `args` is already in `d`, the function simply returns the value associated with `args` without recomputing it.
