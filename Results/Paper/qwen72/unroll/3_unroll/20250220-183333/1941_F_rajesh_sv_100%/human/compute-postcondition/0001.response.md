The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `testcases`. For the loop to execute, `testcases` must be a positive integer. The state of `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is a throwaway variable used to iterate a fixed number of times.

Since `testcases` is the return value of `func_3()`, we need to ensure that `func_3()` returns a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The state of `_` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be set by the loop itself.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0**
