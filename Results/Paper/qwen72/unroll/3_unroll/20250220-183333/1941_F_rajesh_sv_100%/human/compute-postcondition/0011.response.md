Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. `A` remains unchanged. `D` remains unchanged. `F` remains unchanged. `max_diff` remains unchanged. `next_max_diff` remains unchanged. `index` remains unchanged. `left` remains unchanged. `right` remains unchanged. `ans` is the minimum value of `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)` for all `f` in `F` where `l` is the index found by the binary search in the loop.**
