To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head**: `for i in range(1, n):`
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. This is because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`.
   - `A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`.
   - `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`.
   - `F` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()` where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9.
   - `max_diff` is -inf.
   - `next_max_diff` is -inf.
   - `index` is None.

### Adjustments:
- **`n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.
- **`i`**: The loop will start with `i` being 1.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is assigned the value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is assigned the value returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()` where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, `max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is -inf, `index` is None**.
