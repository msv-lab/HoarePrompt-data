Functionality: ** The function `func_6` accepts no parameters and returns no values. It operates on integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `A`, `D`, and `F` with specific constraints. The function identifies the maximum and second maximum differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `A`. It then uses a binary search to find the minimum possible maximum difference between a modified value from `D` and the elements `left` and `right` in `A`, where `left` and `right` are the elements surrounding the maximum difference. Finally, the function prints the larger of the two values: the minimum possible maximum difference found or the second maximum difference. The state of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
