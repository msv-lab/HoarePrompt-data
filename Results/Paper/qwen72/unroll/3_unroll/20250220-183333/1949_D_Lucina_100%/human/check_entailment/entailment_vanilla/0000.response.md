### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the integer `n` and initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input lines, which represent the partial transition video plan.

2. **Counting Known Transitions:**
   - The program iterates through each line of input and updates the counts in `a` and `b` for each scenario based on the known transitions ('F' for funny and 'S' for scary).

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions:**
   - The program creates two lists, `sa` and `sb`, to store the indices of scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.

4. **Deciding the Type of Undecided Transitions:**
   - The program checks which list (`sa` or `sb`) is longer and uses that to decide the type of the remaining transitions.
   - If `sa` is longer, it appends scenarios with no known transitions to `sa` and sets the remaining transitions to 'F' if the scenario indices are in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, otherwise to 'S'.
   - If `sb` is longer, it appends scenarios with no known transitions to `sb` and sets the remaining transitions to 'S' if the scenario indices are in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, otherwise to 'F'.

5. **Outputting the Full Transition Plan:**
   - The program constructs and prints the full transition plan by replacing '?' characters with the decided type ('F' or 'S') while keeping the known transitions unchanged.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Symmetry and Consistency:**
  - The program ensures that the matrix remains symmetric by only modifying the '?' characters and keeping the known transitions consistent.
  - This is important because the transition video between scenarios `i` and `j` should be the same as the transition video between scenarios `j` and `i`.

- **Balancing Transitions:**
  - The program attempts to balance the number of consecutive funny and scary transitions by using the lists `sa` and `sb`.
  - However, the logic for deciding the type of the remaining transitions is not optimal. Specifically, the condition `i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]` (and similarly for `sb`) does not guarantee that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type will occur for any permutation of scenarios.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 2 correctly, as there are no transitions to balance.
  - For larger `n`, the program's logic for balancing transitions is not robust enough to ensure the required constraint for all permutations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type will occur for any permutation of scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
