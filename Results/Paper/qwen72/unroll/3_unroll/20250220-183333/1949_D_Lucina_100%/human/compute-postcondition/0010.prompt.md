Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, the list `xx` will contain `n + 1` strings, where the first string is an empty string and the remaining `n` strings are the input strings provided. The list `a` will contain the counts of 'F' characters for each row (and column) of the input matrix, and the list `b` will contain the counts of 'S' characters for each row (and column) of the input matrix. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged. The list `sa` is now an empty list. The list `sb` is now an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)
    if b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
