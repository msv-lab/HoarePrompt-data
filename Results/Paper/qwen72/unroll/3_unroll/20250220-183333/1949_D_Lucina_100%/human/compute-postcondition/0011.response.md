Postcondition: **The list `xx` will contain `n + 1` strings, where the first string is an empty string and the remaining `n` strings are the input strings provided. The list `a` will contain the counts of 'F' characters for each row (and column) of the input matrix, and the list `b` will contain the counts of 'S' characters for each row (and column) of the input matrix. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged. The list `sa` will contain the indices of rows (and columns) where there is at least one 'F' character and no 'S' characters. The list `sb` will contain the indices of rows (and columns) where there is at least one 'S' character and no 'F' characters. Additionally, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**
