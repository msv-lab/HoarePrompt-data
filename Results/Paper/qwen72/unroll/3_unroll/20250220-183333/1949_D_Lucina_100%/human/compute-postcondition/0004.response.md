The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, and `n` is provided such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24). The variable `i` needs to be set to 1 for the first iteration of the loop to begin.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` must be 1.
- `n` must be an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.

State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user, such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1**
