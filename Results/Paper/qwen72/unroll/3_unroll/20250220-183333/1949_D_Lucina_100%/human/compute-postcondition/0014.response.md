Output State: **The list `sa` will contain the indices of rows (and columns) where there is at least one 'F' character and no 'S' characters, as well as the indices of rows (and columns) where there are no 'F' or 'S' characters. The list `sb` will remain unchanged. The length of `sa` will be greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. The value of `t` will be equal to the length of `sa` after the loop has finished executing. The value of `n` remains unchanged.**
