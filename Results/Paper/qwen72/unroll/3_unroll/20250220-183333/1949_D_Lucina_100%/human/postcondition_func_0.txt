The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, where the characters are either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. It then processes this input to identify rows (and columns) that contain 'F' or 'S' characters, and stores these counts in lists `a` and `b` respectively. The function then determines the indices of rows (and columns) that have only 'F' characters (stored in `sa`) and those that have only 'S' characters (stored in `sb`). If the number of 'F' rows is greater than or equal to the number of 'S' rows, it appends indices of rows with no 'F' or 'S' characters to `sa` and prints a modified version of the input matrix where '?' characters are replaced with 'F' if the row or column index is in the first quarter of `sa`, and with 'S' otherwise. If the number of 'F' rows is less than the number of 'S' rows, it appends indices of rows with no 'F' or 'S' characters to `sb` and prints a modified version of the input matrix where '?' characters are replaced with 'S' if the row or column index is in the first quarter of `sb`, and with 'F' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the modified matrix.
