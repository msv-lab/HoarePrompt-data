The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the range must be non-empty, meaning the input provided to `int(input())` must be a positive integer. The state before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as the loop's execution is solely dependent on the input value.

However, if we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, the input value must be greater than 0. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value to ensure it is a positive integer.

State: **The input value for `int(input())` must be a positive integer (greater than 0)**
