### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes `MOD` to \(10^9 + 6\), which is not necessary for the problem as the modulo operation is only required with `m`.
   - The function processes multiple test cases using a loop. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `arr`, and the string `s`.

2. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the initial product of all elements in `arr` and stores it in `ans`.
   - It then sets `res[0]` to `ans % m % MOD`. However, the second modulo operation with `MOD` is unnecessary and can be simplified to `ans % m`.

3. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to keep track of the current left and right indices of the array.
   - For each command in `s`, it updates `ans` by dividing it by the appropriate element (either `arr[l]` or `arr[r]`), and then takes the result modulo `m` and `MOD`. Again, the second modulo operation with `MOD` is unnecessary.
   - It then updates the corresponding index in `res` and moves the pointer accordingly.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all commands, the function prints the list `res`.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary Modulo Operation:**
  - The function uses `MOD` (which is \(10^9 + 6\)) in the modulo operations, but the problem only requires the result modulo `m`. This can lead to incorrect results if `m` is less than \(10^9 + 6\).
- **Division and Modulo:**
  - Dividing `ans` by an element and then taking the modulo can lead to incorrect results if the division is not exact. For example, if `ans` is not divisible by `arr[l]` or `arr[r]`, the result will be incorrect. This is a critical issue because the product of integers is not always divisible by the elements being removed.

### Correct Approach:
- **Use Modular Inverse:**
  - To correctly update the product after removing an element, the function should use the modular inverse of the element being removed. This ensures that the division is exact in modular arithmetic.

### Correctness:
- **False** due to the unnecessary use of `MOD` and the potential for incorrect results when dividing the product by the elements being removed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def modular_inverse(a, m):
    # Using Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse
    def egcd(a, b):
        if a == 0:
            return (b, 0, 1)
        else:
            g, y, x = egcd(b % a, a)
            return (g, x - (b // a) * y, y)
    
    g, x, _ = egcd(a, m)
    if g != 1:
        raise ValueError('modular inverse does not exist')
    else:
        return x % m

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(input())
        
        res = [0] * n
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        
        res[0] = ans
        
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        
        for k in range(1, n):
            if s[k-1] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * modular_inverse(arr[l], m)) % m
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * modular_inverse(arr[r], m)) % m
                r -= 1
            res[k] = ans
        
        print(*res)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Modular Inverse Function:**
  - The `modular_inverse` function calculates the modular inverse of a number using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
- **Product Calculation:**
  - The initial product is calculated and taken modulo `m`.
- **Processing Commands:**
  - For each command, the product is updated using the modular inverse of the element being removed, ensuring the division is exact in modular arithmetic.
- **Output:**
  - The function prints the list `res` for each test case.

### Final Correctness:
- **Correctness: False** (The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.)
