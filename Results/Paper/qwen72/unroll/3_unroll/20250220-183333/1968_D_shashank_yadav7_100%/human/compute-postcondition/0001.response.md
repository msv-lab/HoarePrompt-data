The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer, and for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
