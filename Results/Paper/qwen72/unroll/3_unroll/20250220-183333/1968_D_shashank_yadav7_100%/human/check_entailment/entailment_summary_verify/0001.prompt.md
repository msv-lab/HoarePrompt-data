You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        bm = a[b] * k
        sm = a[s] * k
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of game scenarios. For each scenario, it reads the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the duration of the game `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha `P_B` and `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. It then iterates through each test case, updating the positions and scores of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation and the array. After processing each test case, it prints the result indicating whether Bodya, Sasha, or neither (a draw) has a higher score. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices, which is correct since Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Initial Scores:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, which is correct as the score increases by the value at the starting position on the first turn.

4. **Simulation of Game Turns:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha by moving to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively. This is correct because the permutation is 1-based, and we need to convert it to 0-based for array indexing.
   - It updates the scores by adding the value at the current position to the respective player's score.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum possible score for each player by considering the remaining turns and the current position. However, this part of the logic is flawed.
   - The variables `bm` and `sm` are supposed to represent the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, but they are not correctly calculated. The program uses a formula `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`, which is incorrect because it does not account for the actual movement and score accumulation over the turns.

6. **Score Comparison:**
   - After simulating the game, the program compares the final scores `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, Bodya wins.
   - If `sm` is greater than `bm`, Sasha wins.
   - If `bm` is equal to `sm`, the game is a draw.

### Issues:
- The logic for calculating the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` is incorrect. The program should not use the formula `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp` to determine the maximum possible score. Instead, it should simply accumulate the scores over the `k` turns as the players move according to the permutation.
- The variable `k` is decremented inside the loop, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results if `k` is not reset for each test case.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        bodya_score = 0
        sasha_score = 0
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- The corrected program correctly simulates the game by accumulating the scores over `k` turns and determining the winner based on the final scores.
- The original program's logic for calculating the maximum possible scores is incorrect and unnecessary.

Correctness: **False**
