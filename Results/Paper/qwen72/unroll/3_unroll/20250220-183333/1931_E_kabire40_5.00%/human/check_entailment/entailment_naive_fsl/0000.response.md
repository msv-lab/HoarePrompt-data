Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, the program does not simulate the turns of the game correctly. It simply reverses the digits of the numbers and concatenates them in a specific order, which does not reflect the actual game rules where Sasha and Anna take turns and Sasha can only concatenate two numbers when it is his turn.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output "Anna" because it does not simulate the turns correctly. According to the program, it reverses the digits of the numbers and concatenates them, but it does not account for the turn-based nature of the game where Anna makes the first move and Sasha then concatenates the numbers.

In the correct simulation:
1. Anna reverses the digits of one of the numbers. If she reverses 14, it becomes 41.
2. Sasha then concatenates 41 and 2, resulting in 412, which is greater than 10^2 = 100, so Sasha wins.

The program does not capture this turn-based logic, leading to incorrect results.
