The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` integers. It constructs a new string `rev_res` by reversing the integers in the list. If the reversed integer has the same length as the original, it is appended directly to `rev_res`. Otherwise, the reversed integer is added to a list `rev_val`. After processing all integers, `rev_val` is sorted, and its elements are alternately appended to `rev_res` in their original and reversed forms. Finally, if the integer value of `rev_res` exceeds \(10^{\text{max\_power}}\), it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, or `a`.
