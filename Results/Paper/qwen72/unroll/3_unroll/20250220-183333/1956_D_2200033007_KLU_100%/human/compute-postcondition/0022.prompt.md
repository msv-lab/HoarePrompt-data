You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer, start_index is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers, and res is a list of tuples. The length of arr is at least start_index + i.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples, `is_already_stairs` is False if any element in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` is not equal to its index; otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains True.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns None.
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples, and `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` is not equal to its index.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program does not return any value.
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples, and `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` is not equal to its index. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers where all elements from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) are set to `i`, `res` is a list of tuples with one additional tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` appended, `is_already_stairs` is False, and `i` is now `i - 1`.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples, and `is_already_stairs` is False. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, then `i` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, all elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + (i - 1)` (inclusive) are set to `i - 1`, and a tuple `(start_index, start_index + (i - 1))` is appended to `res`, with `i` also decreased by 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-negative integer `i` and performs operations on `arr` and `res`. It either returns `None` explicitly or completes without returning a value, resulting in an implicit `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None.

Case_2: The program does not return any value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
