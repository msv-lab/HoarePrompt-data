### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves choosing a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to the MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - It uses dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
   - If `start_index` equals `end_index`, the function returns the maximum of 1 and the element at that index. This is because the MEX of a single-element set is 1 if the element is 0, and the element itself otherwise.
   - The function then tries to split the subarray at different points and recursively computes the maximum sum for the resulting subarrays, combining these results to find the overall maximum sum.
   - The function caches results in `res_dict` to optimize performance.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - If the subarray has a single element, it checks if the element is less than or equal to 0. If so, it returns a single operation to set that element to 1.
   - If the maximum value of the subarray is equal to the square of its length, it means the entire subarray can be set to a single value (the MEX of the subarray), and it appends the corresponding operation to the result list.
   - Otherwise, it recursively finds the optimal split point and constructs the operations for the resulting subarrays.

4. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is responsible for transforming a subarray into a "staircase" pattern, where the elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` are set to the values from 0 to `i`.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired "staircase" pattern. If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and appends the necessary operations to `res`.

5. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program uses a combination of dynamic programming and recursive backtracking to find the optimal sequence of operations.
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the maximum sum for a given subarray.
   - The `func_2` function correctly constructs the sequence of operations based on the results of `func_1`.
   - The `make_stairs` function ensures that the subarray is transformed into the desired pattern, which is necessary for the operations to be valid.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by maximizing the sum of the array elements and constructing the sequence of operations to achieve this sum. The logic and recursive calls are well-structured, and the memoization in `func_1` ensures that the solution is efficient.

Correctness: **True**
