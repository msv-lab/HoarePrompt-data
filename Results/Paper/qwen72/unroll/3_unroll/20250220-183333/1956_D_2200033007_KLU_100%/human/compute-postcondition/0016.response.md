Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples with one additional tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` appended, `is_already_stairs` is False, `i` is now `i - 1`, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`.**

The code appends a new tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to the list `res`, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged except for `i`, which is now `i - 1`. The condition `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i` still holds true.
