### Reasoning

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and the operations to maximize the sum of the array. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to maximize a value that is not the sum of the array but rather a different metric. Specifically, it calculates a value based on the square of the length of the subarray and the sum of the elements in the subarray, which does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the array by setting the subarray to the MEX value.
   - The function does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. The MEX is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray, but `func_1` does not perform this calculation.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to construct a sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum. However, it relies on the incorrect values computed by `func_1`.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed because it does not correctly identify the subarray to set to the MEX value. Instead, it attempts to split the array and recursively find the maximum value, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - The function `make_stairs` is intended to modify the array to form a "staircase" pattern, but it does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray.
   - The function attempts to set all elements in the subarray to `i`, which is not the MEX value. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not necessarily `i`.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the example input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  105 2
  3 3
  3 4
  ```

- **Program Behavior**:
  - The function `func_1` will compute a value based on the square of the length of the subarray and the sum of the elements, which is not the correct approach.
  - The function `func_2` will attempt to construct a sequence of operations based on the incorrect values from `func_1`.
  - The function `make_stairs` will not correctly compute the MEX and will set the subarray to `i`, which is not the correct value.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to maximize the sum of the array by setting subarrays to the MEX value. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` are fundamentally flawed in their approach and do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
