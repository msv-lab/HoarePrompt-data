You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Additionally, the value of `arr[start_index]` is less than or equal to 0.

Additionally, `arr[start_index] + func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)` is not equal to `max_value`, and `arr[end_index] + func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)` is not equal to `max_value`.

Additionally, `arr[start_index] + func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)` is not equal to `max_value`, and `arr[end_index] + func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)` is not equal to `max_value`.

Additionally, `arr[start_index] + func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)` is not equal to `max_value`, and `arr[end_index] + func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)` is not equal to `max_value`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integer parameters `start_index` and `end_index`, and a list `arr` of integers. It returns an empty list if the subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index` is empty. If the subarray contains a single element that is less than or equal to 0, it returns a list with a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. If the subarray length is greater than 1, it returns a list `res` that includes the tuple `(start_index, end_index)` and additional elements from `make_stairs(length - 1)`. If the first element of the subarray is greater than 0 and the subarray length is greater than 1, it returns the result of `func_2(start_index + 1, end_index)`. If the last element of the subarray is greater than 0 and the subarray length is greater than 1, it returns the result of `func_2(start_index, end_index - 1)`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns an empty list.

Case_2: The program returns a list containing a single tuple (start_index, start_index), where `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` < len(`arr`) and `arr[start_index]` is less than or equal to 0.

Case_3: The program returns a list `res` that includes a tuple `(start_index, end_index)` and elements added by `make_stairs(length - 1)`, where `length` is equal to `end_index - start_index + 1` and is greater than 1.

Case_4: The program returns the result of `func_2(start_index + 1, end_index)`.

Case_5: The program returns the result of `func_2(start_index, end_index - 1)`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
