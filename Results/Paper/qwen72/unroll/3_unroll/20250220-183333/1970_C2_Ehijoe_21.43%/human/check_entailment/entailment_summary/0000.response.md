### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Initialization**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1). It then reads the edges of the tree and constructs an adjacency list `nodes` to represent the tree.
   - It also identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a deque `leaves`. However, this deque is not used in the subsequent logic, so it can be considered redundant for the problem at hand.

2. **Starting Node and Distance Calculation**:
   - `func_2` reads the starting node `start` for the round.
   - It calls `func_1` with the adjacency list `nodes` and the starting node `start` to calculate the distances from the starting node to all its descendants.

3. **Distance Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` is a recursive function that calculates the distances from the starting node to all its descendants.
   - If the starting node is a leaf (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is its parent), it returns a list containing the single element 0.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances for each child node and increments each distance by 1 before returning the combined list of distances.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - After obtaining the list of distances from `func_1`, `func_2` checks if there is at least one odd distance in the list.
   - If there is at least one odd distance, Ron wins the round because he can make the first move and force Hermione into a position where she has to make the last move on an even distance, which is a losing position.
   - If all distances are even, Hermione wins the round because Ron will always be forced to make the last move on an even distance, which is a losing position.

5. **Input and Output**:
   - The input and output handling in `func_2` matches the problem description. It reads the necessary inputs and prints the correct output based on the calculated distances.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the distances from the starting node to its descendants. The recursive function `func_1` correctly calculates these distances, and the main function `func_2` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the distances.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
