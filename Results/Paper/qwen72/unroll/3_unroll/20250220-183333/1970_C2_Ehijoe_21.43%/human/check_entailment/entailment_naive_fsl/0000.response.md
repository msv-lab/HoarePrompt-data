Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the case where the tree is a straight line (a path graph) and the starting node is one of the endpoints. In such a case, the player who starts (Ron) will always lose because the tree has no branching, and the only move is to the adjacent node, which will then be the last move, leaving the starting player without a move. However, the program incorrectly determines that Ron wins in such a scenario.

Example Input:
```
3 1
1 2
2 3
1
```
Expected Output:
```
Hermione
```
Actual Output:
```
Ron
```
This is because the function `func_1` calculates the distances to all leaves, but in a path graph, the starting node itself is a leaf, and the function does not account for this correctly. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
