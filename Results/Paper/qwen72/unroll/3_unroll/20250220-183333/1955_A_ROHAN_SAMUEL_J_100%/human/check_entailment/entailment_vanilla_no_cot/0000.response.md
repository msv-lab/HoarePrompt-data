Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. It handles the logic for determining the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts considering both the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Odd Number of Yogurts (n % 2 != 0):**
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`).
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price (`n // 2 * b`) and then buy the remaining one yogurt at the regular price (`a`).

2. **Even Number of Yogurts (n % 2 == 0):**
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`).
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price (`n // 2 * b`).

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the expected output for the given example test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
