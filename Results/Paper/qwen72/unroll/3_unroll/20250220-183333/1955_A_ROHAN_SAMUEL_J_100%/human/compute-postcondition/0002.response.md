The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on some internal or externally provided data that includes an integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function operates on a set of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and for each test case, integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
