The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of piles, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it checks if the number 1 is present in the list of stones. If 1 is present, it prints 'Bob' to standard output; otherwise, it prints 'Alice' to standard output. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external state beyond the standard input and output. The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `e`, and `m` are used internally and their final values are not relevant after the function concludes.
