You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function `math.gcd(x, y)` computes the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then reads \( t \) integers \( x \).
   - It calls a function `func_1` to process each test case and store the results.
   - Finally, it prints each result.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `results` to store the best \( y \) for each test case.
   - For each \( x \) in the test cases, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It iterates over all possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 1.
   - For each \( y \), it computes \( \gcd(x, y) \) and the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - If the current sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and `best_y`.
   - The loop includes a `break` statement, which is problematic because it exits the loop after the first iteration, potentially missing the maximum sum.

4. **Issue with the `break` Statement**:
   - The `break` statement inside the loop causes the program to exit the loop after the first iteration, meaning it only checks \( y = x-1 \) and then stops.
   - This means the program does not check all possible values of \( y \) to find the maximum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The loop should continue to check all values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 1 to ensure the maximum possible sum is found.
   - The `break` statement should be removed to allow the loop to complete.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The current program is incorrect because it does not properly find the maximum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for each \( x \).

Correctness: **False**
