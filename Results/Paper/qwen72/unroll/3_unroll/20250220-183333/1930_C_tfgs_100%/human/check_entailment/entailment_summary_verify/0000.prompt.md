You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        cur += counter[a[i]]
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the user. It then updates each element `a_i` in the list `a` to `a_i + (i + 1)`. After updating, it generates a new list `ans` that contains all unique updated values from `a` in descending order, along with additional integers to fill any gaps between these values, ensuring the final length of `ans` is `n`. The function prints the elements of `ans` in a single line separated by spaces. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not modified outside of the function's scope, and the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the insertion and deletion operations as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem states that after each operation, the element `a_i` is deleted from the array `a`, and the indices of all elements to the right of `a_i` will decrease by 1. However, the provided program does not perform this deletion and index adjustment. Instead, it modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element and then sorts the set of these modified elements. This approach does not follow the specified three-step operation and will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
6 4 8
```
The correct sequence of operations should be:
1. Select `i=3` (last element), insert `8 + 3 = 11` into `S`, and delete `8` from `a`. Now `a = [6, 4]` and `S = {11}`.
2. Select `i=2` (last element of the new `a`), insert `4 + 2 = 6` into `S`, and delete `4` from `a`. Now `a = [6]` and `S = {11, 6}`.
3. Select `i=1` (last element of the new `a`), insert `6 + 1 = 7` into `S`, and delete `6` from `a`. Now `a = []` and `S = {11, 7, 6}`.

The sorted set `S` in decreasing order is `[11, 7, 6]`.

However, the provided program will output:
```
11 7 6
```
which is correct in this case, but it does not follow the correct logic for all cases. For instance, if the input is:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
The correct sequence of operations should be:
1. Select `i=3` (last element), insert `3 + 3 = 6` into `S`, and delete `3` from `a`. Now `a = [1, 2]` and `S = {6}`.
2. Select `i=2` (last element of the new `a`), insert `2 + 2 = 4` into `S`, and delete `2` from `a`. Now `a = [1]` and `S = {6, 4}`.
3. Select `i=1` (last element of the new `a`), insert `1 + 1 = 2` into `S`, and delete `1` from `a`. Now `a = []` and `S = {6, 4, 2}`.

The sorted set `S` in decreasing order is `[6, 4, 2]`.

However, the provided program will output:
```
6 4 3
```
which is incorrect because `3` should not be in the set `S` after the operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
