The function `func_1` does not have any parameters listed in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it seems that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`.

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).

Since the function signature does not match the parameters described in the constraints, we will assume the function should be defined as:

```python
def func_1(t, n, a):
```

Now, let's consider the output based on the provided constraints:

- If `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) is between 1 and \(10^9\), the function returns a result based on these inputs.

However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the problem statement. Without this information, we cannot fully describe the functionality of the function. If you can provide the expected output or return value, I can complete the description.

For now, based on the available information:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\). The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided.**
