### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to it, where `i` is the index of the element. This step is correct as it follows the problem description of inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

3. **Counting and Sorting:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element in `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the unique elements in descending order. This step is correct as it ensures that the elements are unique and sorted in decreasing order.

4. **Constructing the Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the array `b`.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` and appends them to `ans` while also handling the insertion of additional elements to make the array `b` lexicographically largest.
   - The `cur` variable keeps track of the number of elements that need to be inserted between the current and previous elements.
   - The `cnt` variable keeps track of the remaining elements that need to be added to `ans` to reach the total length `n`.

5. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program correctly handles duplicates by decrementing the count of each element in the `counter` and adjusting the `cur` and `cnt` variables accordingly.

6. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After processing all unique elements, the program appends the remaining elements to `ans` in decreasing order to ensure the array `b` is lexicographically largest.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Step 1:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
  - This is correct and follows the problem description.

- **Step 2:**
  - The program modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to it.
  - This is correct and aligns with the problem description of inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

- **Step 3:**
  - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element.
  - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts the unique elements in descending order.
  - This is correct and ensures that the elements are unique and sorted in decreasing order.

- **Step 4:**
  - The program constructs the array `b` by iterating through the sorted unique elements and appending them to `ans`.
  - It also handles the insertion of additional elements to fill any gaps between the unique elements, ensuring the final length of `ans` is `n`.
  - The `cur` variable is used to keep track of the number of elements that need to be inserted between the current and previous elements.
  - The `cnt` variable is used to keep track of the remaining elements that need to be added to `ans` to reach the total length `n`.
  - This step is crucial for ensuring that the array `b` is lexicographically largest.

- **Step 5:**
  - The program correctly handles duplicates by decrementing the count of each element in the `counter` and adjusting the `cur` and `cnt` variables accordingly.
  - This ensures that the final array `b` contains the correct number of elements and is lexicographically largest.

- **Step 6:**
  - After processing all unique elements, the program appends the remaining elements to `ans` in decreasing order.
  - This ensures that the final array `b` is lexicographically largest and has the correct length `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and ensures that the array `b` is constructed to be lexicographically largest. The logic and steps are sound and should produce the correct output for the given inputs.
