Output State: **t remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each a_i has been updated to a_i + (i + 1), `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
