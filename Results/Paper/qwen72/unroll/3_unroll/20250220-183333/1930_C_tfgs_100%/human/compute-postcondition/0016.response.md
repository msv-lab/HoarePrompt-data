Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the user. It then updates each element `a_i` in the list `a` to `a_i + (i + 1)`. After updating, it generates a new list `ans` that contains all unique updated values from `a` in descending order, along with additional integers to fill any gaps between these values, ensuring the final length of `ans` is `n`. The function prints the elements of `ans` in a single line separated by spaces. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not modified outside of the function's scope, and the function does not return any value. **
