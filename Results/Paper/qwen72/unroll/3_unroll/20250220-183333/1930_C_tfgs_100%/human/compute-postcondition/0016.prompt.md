You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 \leq t \leq 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: t remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each a_i has been updated to a_i + (i + 1). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order where each `a_i` has been updated to `a_i + (i + 1)`, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` before the update, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all integers from the original list `a` plus additional integers that fill the gaps between the updated values of `a` such that the length of `ans` is `n`.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order where each `a_i` has been updated to `a_i + (i + 1)`, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` before the update, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all integers from the original list `a` plus additional integers that fill the gaps between the updated values of `a` such that the length of `ans` is `n`.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: [a_0 + 1, a_1 + 2, a_2 + 3, ..., a_m + (m + 1), additional integers to fill the gaps] (where the additional integers are the next smallest integers not already in the list to ensure the length of `ans` is `n`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\). The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
