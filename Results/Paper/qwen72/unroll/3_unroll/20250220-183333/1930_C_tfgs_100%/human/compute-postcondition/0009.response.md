Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order where each `a_i` has been updated to `a_i + (i + 1)`, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` before the update, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list.**
