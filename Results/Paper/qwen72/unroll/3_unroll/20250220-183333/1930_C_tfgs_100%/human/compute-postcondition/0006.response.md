Output State: **t remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, a is now a list of unique integers where each a_i has been updated to a_i + (i + 1), `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` before the update, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(set(a))` converts the list `a` into a set, removing any duplicate values, and then converts it back into a list.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `counter`, and `cur` remain unchanged.
- The list `a` now contains only unique integers, but each integer in the list has already been updated to `a_i + (i + 1)` as per the initial state.
- The `counter` object still contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` before the duplicates were removed.
