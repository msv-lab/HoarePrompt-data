To ensure the for loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n):`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is automatically managed by the `range(n)` function, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 up to `n-1`. We do not need to adjust this variable manually.

2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `mex` is an empty list
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user
- `minn` is 0
- `maxx` is 0

We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables and objects mentioned in the initial state are not directly relevant to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`mex` is an empty list, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is 0**
