Functionality: ** The function `construct_permutation` (as intended) should accept an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. However, the provided code does not match this signature and instead reads input directly from the user. It processes a single list `arr` of integers, calculating a list `mex` of MEX (Minimum EXcludant) values based on the elements of `arr`. The function prints the MEX values separated by spaces and then prints an empty line. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the list `mex` containing the calculated MEX values, and the variables `minn` and `maxx` which were used in the calculation. The function does not modify the input variables `t` or `test_cases` as they are not used in the function. **
