### Reasoning

The original assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The provided counterexample indeed shows that the program's output does not match the expected output. Let's analyze the code and the function summary to understand why this is the case.

#### Function Summary Analysis
The function `func_1` is supposed to:
1. Read the length `n` of the permutation and the array `arr`.
2. Calculate the MEX values for the permutation based on the elements of `arr`.
3. Print the MEX values.

However, the function does not correctly construct the permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`. Instead, it constructs a list `mex` which is intended to be the permutation but is not calculated correctly.

#### Code Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0.

2. **Loop through `arr`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]`:
     - If `arr[i] > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
     - If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `maxx` and sets `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces and then prints an empty line.

#### Issues in the Code
1. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX calculation is not correctly implemented. The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence. The current logic does not ensure that the MEX is correctly calculated for each prefix of the permutation.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the relationship between `p_i` and `a_i` as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the calculation `abs(arr[i] - minn)` does not always yield the correct MEX value.

3. **Example Counterexample**:
   - For the input `1 1 -2 1 2`, the expected output is `0 1 4 2 3`.
   - The actual output from the program is `0 1 3 2 4`.

   Let's break down the expected and actual outputs:
   - **Expected Output**:
     - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`
     - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`
     - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`
     - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1`
     - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2`

   - **Actual Output**:
     - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`
     - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`
     - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 3) - 3 = -2`
     - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 3, 2) - 2 = 1`
     - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 3, 2, 4) - 4 = 2`

   The actual output does not match the expected output because the MEX values are not correctly calculated. For example, `MEX(0, 1, 3)` should be 2, but the program incorrectly calculates it as 3.

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` and appending values to `mex` is flawed, leading to incorrect MEX values and, consequently, an incorrect permutation.

Final: **False**
