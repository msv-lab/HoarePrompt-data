You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def construct_permutation(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: `mex` is a list of integers representing the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) values calculated for each element in `arr`. `minn` is the next positive integer that was not included in `mEX` during the loop execution. `maxx` is the maximum value that was appended to `mex` during the loop execution. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: The values of `mex`, `minn`, `maxx`, `t`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged. The loop only prints the elements of `mex` in the same order they appear in the list, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `construct_permutation` (as intended) should accept an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. However, the provided code does not match this signature and instead reads input directly from the user. It processes a single list `arr` of integers, calculating a list `mex` of MEX (Minimum EXcludant) values based on the elements of `arr`. The function prints the MEX values separated by spaces and then prints an empty line. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the list `mex` containing the calculated MEX values, and the variables `minn` and `maxx` which were used in the calculation. The function does not modify the input variables `t` or `test_cases` as they are not used in the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Reading Input**: The function reads the length `n` and the array `a` for each test case.
   - **Initialization**: It initializes two lists: `mex` to store the constructed permutation and `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the current range of values in the permutation.
   - **Constructing the Permutation**:
     - For each element `arr[i]` in `a`:
       - If `arr[i] > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This is because if `a[i] > 0`, the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` must be `minn` and `p[i]` must be `minn - a[i]`, which simplifies to `minn` since `a[i]` is positive.
       - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is because if `a[i] <= 0`, the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` must be `p[i] + a[i]`, and `p[i]` must be `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
       - It updates `maxx` if the new value in `mex` exceeds the current `maxx`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the constructed permutation `mex` for each test case.

5. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the permutation based on the given rules.
   - It ensures that the MEX calculation and the permutation values are consistent with the input array `a`.
   - The program also ensures that the values in `mex` are unique and cover the range from 0 to `n-1`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the case where `n = 1` correctly.
   - It should handle the case where all elements in `a` are positive or all are negative correctly.

After reviewing the logic and the implementation, the program appears to correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
