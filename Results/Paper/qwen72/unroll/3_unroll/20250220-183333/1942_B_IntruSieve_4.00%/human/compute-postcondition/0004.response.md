Output State: **`mex` is an empty list, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. `minn` is 0. `maxx` is 0.**
