The function `what_the_mex` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the permutation p and the array a, and an array a of n integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n) constructed based on the MEX operation as described. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for each test case.
