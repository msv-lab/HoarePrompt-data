You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user. It then calculates and prints a value `k` based on the following rules: If `b` is not divisible by 3 and `c` is less than 3, and the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as the sum of `a` and the integer division of `(b + c)` by 3, and if `(b + c)` is not divisible by 3, it increments `k` by 1. The function does not return any value, but it prints the calculated `k` for each test case. After the function concludes, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the ones from the last test case, and `n` will remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)` to convert them to integers.

2. **Introverts (a)**:
   - Each introvert requires a separate tent. Therefore, the number of tents needed for introverts is `a`.

3. **Extroverts (b)**:
   - Each extrovert requires a tent with exactly two other people. Therefore, the number of tents needed for extroverts is `b // 3` (full tents with 3 people each).
   - If there are any remaining extroverts after forming full tents, they need to be paired with universals.

4. **Universals (c)**:
   - Universals can be used to fill in the remaining spots in tents with extroverts or form their own tents.
   - The program checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals. If `b % 3 != 0` and there are fewer than 3 universals, it is impossible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts, and the program outputs `-1`.

5. **Tent Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of tents as `a + (b + c) // 3`.
   - If there are any remaining people after forming full tents, it adds one more tent to accommodate them.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3` correctly by checking if it is impossible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts.
   - It also handles the case where `b + c` is not divisible by 3 by adding an extra tent.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of the Logic**:
  - The program correctly handles the number of tents needed for introverts.
  - It correctly calculates the number of full tents needed for extroverts.
  - It checks if it is possible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts using universals.
  - The final calculation of the total number of tents is correct.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly outputs `-1` when it is impossible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts.
  - It handles the case where there are no participants (`a = b = c = 0`) by outputting `0`.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly handle all the given requirements and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
