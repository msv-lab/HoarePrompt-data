### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)` to convert them to integers.

2. **Introverts (a)**:
   - Each introvert requires a separate tent. Therefore, the number of tents needed for introverts is `a`.

3. **Extroverts (b)**:
   - Each extrovert requires a tent with exactly two other people. Therefore, the number of tents needed for extroverts is `b // 3` (full tents with 3 people each).
   - If there are any remaining extroverts after forming full tents, they need to be paired with universals.

4. **Universals (c)**:
   - Universals can be used to fill in the remaining spots in tents with extroverts or form their own tents.
   - The program checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals. If `b % 3 != 0` and there are fewer than 3 universals, it is impossible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts, and the program outputs `-1`.

5. **Tent Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of tents as `a + (b + c) // 3`.
   - If there are any remaining people after forming full tents, it adds one more tent to accommodate them.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3` correctly by checking if it is impossible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts.
   - It also handles the case where `b + c` is not divisible by 3 by adding an extra tent.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of the Logic**:
  - The program correctly handles the number of tents needed for introverts.
  - It correctly calculates the number of full tents needed for extroverts.
  - It checks if it is possible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts using universals.
  - The final calculation of the total number of tents is correct.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly outputs `-1` when it is impossible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts.
  - It handles the case where there are no participants (`a = b = c = 0`) by outputting `0`.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly handle all the given requirements and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
