Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly handle all the conditions specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The program checks if `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3` and `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. This condition is not sufficient to determine if it's impossible to accommodate all participants.
   - The program should ensure that there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts. If there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, it should output -1.

2. **Calculation of Tents:**
   - The program calculates the number of tents as `k += a + (b + c) // 3` and then adds 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the specific requirements of introverts and extroverts.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - Each introvert needs a separate tent, so the number of tents for introverts is `a`.
   - Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. Therefore, we need to check if we can form groups of three people (where each group contains one extrovert and two others, which can be universals or extroverts).
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots. If not, it is impossible to accommodate all participants, and the program should output -1.
   - The remaining universals can be accommodated in any way, so we need to calculate the number of tents required for the remaining universals.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Tents for introverts
        k = a
        
        # Tents for extroverts
        if b % 3 == 0:
            k += b // 3
        else:
            k += b // 3
            remaining_extroverts = b % 3
            if c >= 3 - remaining_extroverts:
                c -= 3 - remaining_extroverts
                k += 1
            else:
                print(-1)
                continue
        
        # Tents for remaining universals
        k += (c + 2) // 3
        
        print(k)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- Each introvert gets a separate tent.
- Extroverts are accommodated in groups of three, and if there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, it outputs -1.
- The remaining universals are accommodated in the minimum number of tents.
