### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array are minimized, and the sum of these differences is maximized when the array is sorted in ascending order.

However, the provided program does not sort the array. Instead, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints this difference for each test case. This approach is incorrect because the difference between the maximum and minimum values does not necessarily correspond to the maximum beauty of the array.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the array should be sorted in ascending order, and then the beauty should be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

### Incorrectness of the Given Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Beauty:** The program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array.
- **No Sorting:** The program does not sort the array, which is necessary to maximize the beauty.

### Example:
For the input:
```
3
3
2 1 3
3
69 69 69
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
- **Test Case 1:** The sorted array is \([1, 2, 3]\). The beauty is \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\).
- **Test Case 2:** The sorted array is \([69, 69, 69]\). The beauty is \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0\).
- **Test Case 3:** The sorted array is \([43, 54, 80, 90, 100]\). The beauty is \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\).

The given program would output:
```
2
0
57
```
which is correct for the first two test cases but incorrect for the third test case because it does not sort the array.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.

### Correctness:
**False**
