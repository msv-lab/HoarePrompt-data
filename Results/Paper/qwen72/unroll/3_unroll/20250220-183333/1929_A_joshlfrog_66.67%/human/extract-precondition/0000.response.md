Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) with each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def max_beauty(t, test_cases):
```

Where:
- **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases.**
- **test_cases is a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the elements of the array a for each test case.**
