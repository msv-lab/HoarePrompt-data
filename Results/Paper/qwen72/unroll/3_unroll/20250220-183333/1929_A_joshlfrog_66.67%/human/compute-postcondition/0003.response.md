The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `cases` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), and each integer `a_i` has the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. For each test case, the function determines a specific output based on the integers in the inner list.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `cases` where each inner list contains `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) with each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the integers in the inner lists.**
