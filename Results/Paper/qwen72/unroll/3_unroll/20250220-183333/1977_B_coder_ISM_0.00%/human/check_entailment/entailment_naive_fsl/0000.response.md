Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the conversion of the binary representation of `x` into an array that meets the specified conditions. Specifically, the logic for converting `1`s in the binary representation to `-1`s and ensuring no two consecutive non-zero elements exist is flawed. Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
14
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
0 -1 0 0 1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output an incorrect array that does not meet the condition that no two consecutive non-zero elements should exist. The logic for converting `1`s to `-1`s and adjusting the array is not correctly implemented, leading to potential violations of the constraints.
