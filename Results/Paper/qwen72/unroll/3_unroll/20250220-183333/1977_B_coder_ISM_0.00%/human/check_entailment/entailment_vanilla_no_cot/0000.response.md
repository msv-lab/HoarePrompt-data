Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Output Format**: The program does not output the length of the array `n` before printing the array itself. According to the problem description, the first line of each test case should be the length of the array, followed by the array on the second line.

2. **Handling of `-1` and `0`**: The logic for converting `1` to `-1` and ensuring that there are no consecutive non-zero elements is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the propagation of `-1` values and the adjustment of the array length.

3. **Array Length**: The program always initializes the array with a length of 30, but the problem description states that the length `n` should be between 1 and 32. The program does not dynamically adjust the length based on the input `x`.

4. **Final Adjustment**: The final adjustment of the array to ensure no consecutive non-zero elements is not correctly implemented. The program may leave the array in an invalid state.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Convert the integer `x` to its binary representation.
- Adjust the binary representation to ensure no consecutive non-zero elements by using `-1` and `0` appropriately.
- Output the length of the resulting array and the array itself.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        flag = 0
        for i in range(30):
            if x & (1 << i):
                if flag:
                    s.append('-1')
                    flag = 0
                else:
                    s.append('1')
                    flag = 1
            else:
                if flag:
                    s.append('0')
                    flag = 0
                else:
                    s.append('0')
        
        # Remove trailing zeros
        while s and s[-1] == '0':
            s.pop()
        
        # If the last element is -1, we need to add a 1 at the end
        if s and s[-1] == '-1':
            s.append('1')
        
        n = len(s)
        print(n)
        print(*s)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Binary Conversion**: The program iterates through the bits of `x` and appends `1` or `0` to the array `s` based on whether the bit is set.
- **Adjustment for Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**: If a bit is set and the previous bit was also set (indicated by `flag`), the program appends `-1` and resets the `flag`. Otherwise, it appends `1` and sets the `flag`.
- **Trailing Zeros**: The program removes trailing zeros from the array to ensure the length is minimal.
- **Final Adjustment**: If the last element is `-1`, the program appends a `1` to the array to balance it.
- **Output**: The program then prints the length of the array and the array itself.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem.
