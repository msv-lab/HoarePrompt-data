To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `suit` and `rank`. The loop will iterate over the items in the `suits` dictionary, so the dictionary `suits` must have at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute.

State: **`trumps` will be an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary that must have at least one key-value pair, `rank` is the value associated with the first `suit` in the dictionary, `suit` is the first key in the dictionary, `answers` is an empty list**
