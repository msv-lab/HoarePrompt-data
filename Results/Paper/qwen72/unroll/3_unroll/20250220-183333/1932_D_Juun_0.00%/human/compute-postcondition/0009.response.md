Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `trumps` will be empty if it initially contained enough ranks to pair with all non-trump suits, otherwise, it will contain the remaining ranks. The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for all suits that had a trump card played, and the last non-trump card rank for any suit that did not have a trump card played. The `answers` list will contain strings representing pairs of cards (in sorted order by rank) for each suit where two non-trump cards were played, formatted as "rank1 suit rank2 suit". If there are more non-trump suits than trump ranks, the loop will print 'IMPOSSIBLE' and terminate.
