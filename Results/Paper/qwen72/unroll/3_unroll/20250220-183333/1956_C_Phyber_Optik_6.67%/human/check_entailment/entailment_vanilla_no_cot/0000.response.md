Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the sum of all numbers in the matrix using the specified operations, and the program should output the operations that achieve this. However, the program does not correctly determine the maximum possible sum or the operations needed to achieve it.

1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the sum by iterating through the numbers from 1 to \( n \) and adding either \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) or \( i \times n \) to the sum based on a condition. This logic is flawed and does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum for the matrix.

2. **Incorrect Operation Count**:
   - The program calculates the number of operations as \( n + r \), where \( r \) is determined in a loop. This is not a correct way to ensure that the number of operations is no more than \( 2n \).

3. **Incorrect Operation Output**:
   - The operations are output in a loop, but the logic for determining whether to perform a Type 1 or Type 2 operation is incorrect. Specifically, the condition `if j <= n` is used to decide the type of operation, but this does not align with the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, the maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the maximum possible values using the given operations. The correct approach is to use the permutations \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for both rows and columns, which will result in the maximum sum of \( n^2 \times n \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
        operations = 2 * n
        print(max_sum, operations)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum sum and outputs the operations needed to achieve it, ensuring that the number of operations does not exceed \( 2n \).
