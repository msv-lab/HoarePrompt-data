You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of size n . You will do the following process to
calculate your penalty:

  1. Split array a into two (possibly empty) subsequences^\dagger s and t such that every element of a is either in s or t^\ddagger . 
  2. For an array b of size m , define the penalty p(b) of an array b as the number of indices i between 1 and m - 1 where b_i < b_{i + 1} . 
  3. The total penalty you will receive is p(s) + p(t) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subsequence of a sequence y if x can be obtained
from y by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

^\ddagger Some valid ways to split array a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (s,t) are
([3,4,1,5],[1]) , ([1,1],[3,4,5]) and ([\,],[3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,4,5],[1]) , ([3,1,4,1],[1,5]) and ([1,3,4],[5,1]) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1\le n\le 2\cdot
10^5 ) — the size of the array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, a possible way to split a is s=[2,4,5] and t=[1,3] .
The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=2 + 1 =3 .

In the second test case, a possible way to split a is s=[8,3,1] and
t=[2,1,7,4,3] . The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 1 =1 .

In the third test case, a possible way to split a is s=[\,] and t=[3,3,3,3,3]
. The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 0 =0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n and a list of integers a. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized.
   - The penalty `p(b)` for an array `b` is defined as the number of indices `i` where `b_i < b_{i + 1}`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `la` and `lb` to `n + 1`, which is a value greater than any possible element in the array.
   - The variable `ans` is used to keep track of the penalty.
   - The program iterates through each element `i` in the input array `inp`.
   - If `i` is less than or equal to `la`, it updates `la` to `i`.
   - If `i` is greater than `la` but less than or equal to `lb`, it updates `lb` to `i`.
   - If `i` is greater than both `la` and `lb`, it updates `la` to `lb`, `lb` to `i`, and increments `ans` by 1.

3. **Logic Explanation:**
   - The idea is to maintain two variables `la` and `lb` to track the smallest and second smallest elements seen so far.
   - If an element `i` is greater than both `la` and `lb`, it means that `i` is a new element that can potentially create a penalty when added to either `s` or `t`.
   - By updating `la` to `lb` and `lb` to `i`, the program ensures that the new element `i` is the second smallest element seen so far, and it increments the penalty `ans` by 1.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For an array with all elements being the same (e.g., `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`), the penalty will be 0 because no element is greater than the previous one.
   - For an array with only one element (e.g., `[1]`), the penalty will also be 0 because there are no indices `i` such that `1 <= i < m - 1`.
   - For an array with two elements (e.g., `[2, 1]`), the penalty will be 0 because the array is already in non-increasing order.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the test cases provided in the example:
     - For `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the optimal split is `s = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `t = []`, resulting in a penalty of 3.
     - For `a = [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]`, the optimal split is `s = [8, 3, 1]` and `t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of 1.
     - For `a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the optimal split is `s = []` and `t = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of 0.
     - For `a = [1]`, the optimal split is `s = [1]` and `t = []`, resulting in a penalty of 0.
     - For `a = [2, 1]`, the optimal split is `s = [2]` and `t = [1]`, resulting in a penalty of 0.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to minimize the penalty by keeping track of the smallest and second smallest elements and incrementing the penalty only when necessary.
