The function `solve` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of the array a, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array a. The total number of test cases, t, is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
