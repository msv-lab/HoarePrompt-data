#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n and a list of integers a. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. However, the function currently does not perform any actions or return any results, as it only contains a `pass` statement. The intended purpose of the function, based on the annotations, is to process each test case and return a list of results, one for each test case, but this is not implemented in the provided code.
