The function `func_1` accepts two integers `q` and `x` (where 1 <= x < q <= 10^9) and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it is also included in the list `M`. The function does not modify the input variables `q` and `x`.
