### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires determining the number of natural numbers \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the described settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned to Vasya's position \( n \) should match \( x \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a given \( k \), the sequence of numbers assigned to positions repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received must satisfy the pattern. Specifically, \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) should match the position of \( x \) in the pattern.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is odd. If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 because \( y \) being odd implies that no valid \( k \) can satisfy the conditions.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calculates \( q = (y - 2) // 2 \) and calls `func_1` to find all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It then checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and if so, calculates \( q = (n - x) // 2 \) and calls `func_1` again to find more divisors.
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the resulting list is printed.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` takes two integers \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \).
   - It calculates the square root of \( q \) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it adds the square root to \( M \).
   - It iterates through all integers from 1 to \( \lfloor \sqrt{q} \rfloor \) and checks if they are divisors of \( q \). If a divisor is greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \), it adds it to \( M \). It also adds the corresponding quotient if it is greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - The function returns the list \( M \).

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0.
   - The program correctly calculates \( q \) and uses `func_1` to find the divisors.
   - The program correctly combines the results from both calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates.
   - The logic for determining the divisors and checking the conditions is sound.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the provided problem description and execution summary. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
