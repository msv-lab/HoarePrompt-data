You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the function will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` will be updated to their respective values for each test case, but their final values after the loop will be the values from the last test case. The variable `z` will be updated within the loop for each test case where `x` is greater than `k - 1`, but its final value will be the one computed for the last test case where `x` is greater than `k - 1`. The loop counter `_` will have completed all `t` iterations and will no longer be in use.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Bet Rules**:
   - If Sasha bets \( y \) coins and wins, he gets \( y \cdot k \) coins (his coins increase by \( y \cdot (k - 1) \)).
   - If Sasha loses, he loses \( y \) coins.
   - The bet amount \( y \) must be a positive integer and cannot exceed Sasha's current number of coins.
   - Sasha cannot lose more than \( x \) times in a row.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine if Sasha can guarantee to have at least \( n \) coins for any integer \( n \).

### Program Analysis:
The program is structured as follows:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).

2. **Logic**:
   - The program checks different conditions based on the values of \( k \) and \( x \):
     - If \( x < k - 1 \):
       - It checks if \( a \geq x + 1 \). If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
     - If \( x == k - 1 \):
       - It checks if \( a \geq x + 3 \). If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
     - If \( x > k - 1 \):
       - It initializes \( z \) to 0.
       - It iterates from 0 to \( x \) and updates \( z \) using the formula \( z += z // (k - 1) + 1 \).
       - It checks if \( a \geq z \). If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Reasoning:
1. **Case \( x < k - 1 \)**:
   - If \( x < k - 1 \), Sasha can always recover from a loss because the number of consecutive losses is less than the multiplier \( k - 1 \).
   - Therefore, if Sasha has at least \( x + 1 \) coins initially, he can always place bets such that he can recover from any sequence of losses and eventually win more coins.
   - This part of the logic is correct.

2. **Case \( x == k - 1 \)**:
   - If \( x == k - 1 \), Sasha can lose \( k - 1 \) times in a row, which means he can lose up to \( (k - 1) \cdot y \) coins in a row.
   - To ensure he can recover, he needs to have enough coins to place a bet that will recover from the maximum possible loss.
   - The condition \( a \geq x + 3 \) is a heuristic, but it is not clear why \( x + 3 \) is chosen. This part of the logic is not well-justified and may be incorrect.

3. **Case \( x > k - 1 \)**:
   - If \( x > k - 1 \), the logic involves a loop to calculate \( z \).
   - The loop updates \( z \) using \( z += z // (k - 1) + 1 \). This formula is not clear and does not seem to correctly model the recovery strategy.
   - The condition \( a \geq z \) is used to determine if Sasha can guarantee having enough coins, but the calculation of \( z \) is not well-justified.

### Conclusion:
The program has some logical issues, particularly in the cases where \( x == k - 1 \) and \( x > k - 1 \). The conditions and the loop used to calculate \( z \) are not well-justified and may not correctly determine if Sasha can guarantee having at least \( n \) coins for any integer \( n \).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
