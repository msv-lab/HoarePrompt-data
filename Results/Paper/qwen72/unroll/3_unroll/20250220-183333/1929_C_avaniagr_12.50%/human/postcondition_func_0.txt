The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines whether the value of `a` meets certain conditions based on `k` and `x`, and prints 'YES' if the condition is met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes all `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. The final state of the program is that the input has been fully processed, and the results for each test case have been printed to the standard output.
