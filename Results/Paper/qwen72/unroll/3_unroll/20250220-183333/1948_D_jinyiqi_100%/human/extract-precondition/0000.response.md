Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: t (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of testcases, and a list of strings s (each string s has a length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000 and consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks). The total length of the strings over all testcases does not exceed 5000.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the parameters as described. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def max_tandem_repeat_length(t, testcases):
```

With the precondition:

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and testcases is a list of t strings, where each string s has a length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000 and consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of the strings over all testcases does not exceed 5000.**
