Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring after replacing all question marks in the input string with lowercase Latin letters. However, there are a few issues with the provided program:

1. **Function Call and Parameters**: The function `func_1` is called without any parameters, but it should be designed to handle the input string for each test case. The function should be called inside the loop for each test case, and it should process the string provided for that test case.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters, which means it cannot process the input string for each test case. Instead, it reads the string from user input directly, which is not the correct approach for handling multiple test cases.

3. **Logic for Tandem Repeat**: The logic inside `func_1` is intended to find the longest tandem repeat substring. It iterates over possible lengths of the tandem repeat from the largest to the smallest and checks if the substring can be a tandem repeat by comparing characters at positions `k` and `k + j`. However, the logic for checking the tandem repeat is flawed because it does not correctly handle the replacement of question marks with the same character to form a tandem repeat.

4. **Return Statement**: The function returns after printing the length of the longest tandem repeat, which is correct. However, the function should be called in a loop for each test case, and the loop should handle the input for each test case.

5. **Input Handling**: The program should handle the input for multiple test cases correctly. The current implementation reads the number of test cases `t` but does not handle the input for each test case properly.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands. The function should accept the string as a parameter, and the loop should call the function with the appropriate input for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
