Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The program does not correctly account for the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Case 1: \( m < a \) and \( m < b \)**
   - The program prints `2`, which is correct because no two fireworks from the same installation will overlap, and the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2 (one from each installation).

2. **Case 2: \( m < a \) and \( m > b \)**
   - The program prints `2 + m // b`, which is incorrect. The visibility period of a firework from the first installation is \( m + 1 \) minutes, and it will not overlap with another firework from the same installation. However, the program incorrectly adds the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within \( m \) minutes, which is not the correct way to determine the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.

3. **Case 3: \( m < b \) and \( m > a \)**
   - Similar to Case 2, the program prints `2 + m // a`, which is incorrect for the same reason.

4. **Case 4: \( m \ge a \) and \( m \ge b \)**
   - The program prints `m // a + m // b + 2`, which is also incorrect. The visibility period of a firework is \( m + 1 \) minutes, and the program should consider the overlap of visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously, we need to consider the following:

- The visibility period of a firework is \( m + 1 \) minutes.
- We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible at any minute \( t \) within the first \( m + 1 \) minutes.

The correct logic should be:
1. Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the first \( m + 1 \) minutes.
2. Determine the maximum overlap of these fireworks.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        max_fireworks = 0
        for t in range(m + 1):
            # Calculate the number of fireworks visible at time t
            fireworks_at_t = (t // a + 1) + ((t + m) // b - (t // b))
            max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, fireworks_at_t)
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- For each test case, we iterate over each minute \( t \) from 0 to \( m \).
- For each minute \( t \), we calculate the number of fireworks launched by the first installation that are visible at time \( t \) and the number of fireworks launched by the second installation that are visible at time \( t \).
- We update the maximum number of fireworks seen simultaneously if the current count is greater than the previous maximum.

This approach ensures that we correctly account for the visibility periods and overlaps of fireworks launched by both installations.
