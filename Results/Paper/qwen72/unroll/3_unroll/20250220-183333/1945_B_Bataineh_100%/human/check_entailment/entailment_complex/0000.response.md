### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`**:
     - In this case, no two fireworks from different installations will overlap in their visibility times. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time will be 2 (one from each installation).
   - **If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`**:
     - Here, the fireworks from the second installation (with frequency `b`) can overlap with each other, but not with the fireworks from the first installation (with frequency `a`). The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time will be `2 + m // b`, where `m // b` represents the number of additional fireworks from the second installation that can be visible at the same time.
   - **If `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`**:
     - Similar to the previous case, but the fireworks from the first installation (with frequency `a`) can overlap with each other, but not with the fireworks from the second installation (with frequency `b`). The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time will be `2 + m // a`.
   - **If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`**:
     - In this case, both installations can have multiple fireworks visible at the same time. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time will be `m // a + m // b + 2`, where `m // a` and `m // b` represent the number of additional fireworks from each installation that can be visible at the same time, and `2` represents the initial fireworks from each installation.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case based on the conditions.

### Analysis of the Conditions:

- The conditions are designed to handle different scenarios based on the relationship between `m`, `a`, and `b`.
- The logic for calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time seems to be correct for the given problem description.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1**: `a = 6`, `b = 7`, `m = 4`
  - `m < a` and `m < b` are both true.
  - The function prints `2`, which is correct as no two fireworks from different installations will overlap.

- **Example 2**: `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `m = 10`
  - `m > a` and `m > b` are both true.
  - The function prints `2 + 10 // 3 + 10 // 4 = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7`, which is correct.

- **Example 3**: `a = 7`, `b = 8`, `m = 56`
  - `m > a` and `m > b` are both true.
  - The function prints `2 + 56 // 7 + 56 // 8 = 2 + 8 + 7 = 17`, which is correct.

- **Example 4**: `a = 5`, `b = 6`, `m = 78123459896`
  - `m > a` and `m > b` are both true.
  - The function prints `2 + 78123459896 // 5 + 78123459896 // 6 = 2 + 15624691979 + 13020576649 = 28645268630`, which is correct.

- **Example 5**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `m = 1`
  - `m < a` and `m < b` are both false.
  - The function prints `2 + 1 // 1 + 1 // 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4`, which is correct.

- **Example 6**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `m = 1000000000000000000`
  - `m > a` and `m > b` are both true.
  - The function prints `2 + 1000000000000000000 // 1 + 1000000000000000000 // 1 = 2 + 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 = 2000000000000000002`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
