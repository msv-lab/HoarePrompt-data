Output State: **The function still accepts two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the trace of a string. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and it is guaranteed that for each trace, there exists a suitable string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z. The variable `a` is now a string containing all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'.**
