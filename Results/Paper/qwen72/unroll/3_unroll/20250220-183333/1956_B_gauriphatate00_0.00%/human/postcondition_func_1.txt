The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input, processes it to handle `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1` with `n` and `a` as arguments and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results`. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `results` contains the results of `func_1` for each test case, and these results have been printed to the standard output. The input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, and `idx` remain unchanged after the function concludes.
