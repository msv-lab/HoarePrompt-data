Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly uses the `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - The variable `pairs` is calculated by summing up the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a`. This is correct because each integer that appears exactly twice can potentially score a point if the other card with the same integer is already on the table.
   - The function returns `min(pairs, n // 2)`. This is because you can only place up to `n // 2` cards in your turns, and the number of points you can score is limited by the number of pairs you have and the number of turns you can take. This logic is sound and aligns with the problem constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the entire input at once and processes it to handle multiple test cases.
   - It correctly initializes the index `idx` and processes the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of cards `n` and the list of cards `a` in your hand.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, the maximum number of points you can get is 0 if you have a single card, or 1 if you have a pair.
   - It correctly handles the case where you have no pairs of cards. In this case, `pairs` will be 0, and the function will return 0.
   - It correctly handles the case where you have all pairs of cards. In this case, `pairs` will be equal to `n // 2`, and the function will return `n // 2`.
   - The program also correctly handles the input constraints, ensuring that it processes up to `10^4` test cases and that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, given that Nene plays optimally as well.

Final: **True**
