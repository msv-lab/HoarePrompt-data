Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n and appears at most twice in the list, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.** 

The input has been read and split into a list of strings, which is now stored in the variable `data`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged and retain their initial properties.
