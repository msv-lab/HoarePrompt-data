To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the code step by step and analyze it based on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- Each test case contains four integers \(p_i\) such that \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases:**
   - The code starts by reading an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - This is done using `int(input())`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the code reads four integers \(p_i\) from the input.
   - This is done using `map(int, input().split())`, which splits the input string into a list of integers.

3. **Calculating the Sum for Each Test Case:**
   - The code then calculates a sum for each test case using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
   - The generator expression is `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in enumerate(map(int, input().split()))`.
   - Let's break down this expression:
     - `x // 2` is the integer division of `x` by 2.
     - `3 * (x // 2)` is three times the integer division of `x` by 2.
     - `x % 2` is the remainder when `x` is divided by 2 (0 if `x` is even, 1 if `x` is odd).
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` is the remainder of `x` divided by 2 multiplied by a condition `(i < 3)`, which is 1 if `i` is less than 3 and 0 otherwise.
     - Therefore, for the first three elements (i.e., when `i` is 0, 1, or 2), the expression adds `x % 2` to the sum. For the fourth element (i.e., when `i` is 3), the expression does not add `x % 2`.

4. **Summing and Dividing:**
   - The sum of the expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` for all four integers is calculated.
   - This sum is then divided by 3 using integer division (`// 3`).

5. **Formatting and Printing:**
   - The result of the division is converted to a string and joined with newline characters (`\n`).
   - This is done using `'\n'.join([...])`.

### Final Output:
- The code will print one line for each test case.
- Each line will contain the result of the sum calculation divided by 3.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example with `t = 2` and the following test cases:
- Test Case 1: `4 5 6 7`
- Test Case 2: `1 2 3 4`

#### Test Case 1:
- \(p_0 = 4\)
- \(p_1 = 5\)
- \(p_2 = 6\)
- \(p_3 = 7\)

The sum calculation:
- \(3 * (4 // 2) + 4 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 3 * 2 + 0 * 1 = 6\)
- \(3 * (5 // 2) + 5 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 * 2 + 1 * 1 = 7\)
- \(3 * (6 // 2) + 6 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 * 3 + 0 * 1 = 9\)
- \(3 * (7 // 2) + 7 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 3 * 3 + 1 * 0 = 9\)

Total sum: \(6 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 31\)

Divide by 3: \(31 // 3 = 10\)

#### Test Case 2:
- \(p_0 = 1\)
- \(p_1 = 2\)
- \(p_2 = 3\)
- \(p_3 = 4\)

The sum calculation:
- \(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 3 * 0 + 1 * 1 = 1\)
- \(3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 * 1 + 0 * 1 = 3\)
- \(3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 4\)
- \(3 * (4 // 2) + 4 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 3 * 2 + 0 * 0 = 6\)

Total sum: \(1 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 14\)

Divide by 3: \(14 // 3 = 4\)

### Final Output:
Output: **10
4**

This is the output for the given example. For any other input, the output will be the result of the sum calculation divided by 3 for each test case, formatted as one line per test case.

Output: **[result of sum calculation divided by 3 for each test case] (where each test case contains four integers \(p_i\) such that \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\))**
