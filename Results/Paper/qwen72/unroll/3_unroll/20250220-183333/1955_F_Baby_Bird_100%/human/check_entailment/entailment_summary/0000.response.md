Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice by removing numbers optimally. The key to solving this problem is understanding the behavior of the XOR operation and how removing numbers can affect the XOR result.

1. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of all numbers is zero.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers becomes zero as often as possible.
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers can be zero if the counts of certain numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) are balanced in a specific way.

4. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula used in the program is `sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3`.
   - Let's break it down:
     - `x // 2` gives the number of pairs of each type of number.
     - `3 * (x // 2)` accounts for the fact that each pair of numbers (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), or (4, 4) will contribute to making the XOR zero.
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder when `x` is divided by 2, which is 0 if `x` is even and 1 if `x` is odd.
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` adds 1 to the sum if `x` is odd and `i` is less than 3 (i.e., for the numbers 1, 2, and 3).
     - The entire sum is then divided by 3 to get the final result.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula seems to be designed to count the number of times the XOR can be made zero by removing numbers optimally.
   - The division by 3 at the end is likely to account for the fact that each pair of numbers (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), or (4, 4) can be removed to make the XOR zero, and the remainder handling ensures that single odd counts of 1, 2, and 3 are also considered.

6. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the input `1 1 1 0`, the formula calculates:
     - `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1`
     - `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1`
     - `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1`
     - `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0`
     - Sum: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
     - Result: `3 // 3 = 1`
   - This matches the expected output of 1.

   - For the input `1 0 1 2`, the formula calculates:
     - `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1`
     - `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0`
     - `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1`
     - `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3`
     - Sum: `1 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 5`
     - Result: `5 // 3 = 1`
   - This matches the expected output of 1.

   - For the input `2 2 2 0`, the formula calculates:
     - `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3`
     - `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3`
     - `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3`
     - `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0`
     - Sum: `3 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 9`
     - Result: `9 // 3 = 3`
   - This matches the expected output of 3.

   - For the input `3 3 2 0`, the formula calculates:
     - `3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 3 + 1 = 4`
     - `3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 + 1 = 4`
     - `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3`
     - `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0`
     - Sum: `4 + 4 + 3 + 0 = 11`
     - Result: `11 // 3 = 3`
   - This matches the expected output of 3.

   - For the input `0 9 9 9`, the formula calculates:
     - `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0`
     - `3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 * 4 + 1 = 13`
     - `3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 * 4 + 1 = 13`
     - `3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 3 * 4 + 0 = 12`
     - Sum: `0 + 13 + 13 + 12 = 38`
     - Result: `38 // 3 = 12`
   - This matches the expected output of 12.

Given the above analysis and verification with the provided examples, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
