Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice by optimally removing numbers from a sequence of integers, each not exceeding 4. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The program provided is a single function that processes multiple test cases. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case. Each test case consists of four integers `p_i` representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The program uses a list comprehension to calculate the sum of a specific expression for each test case:
   - `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` is the expression used.
   - `x // 2` gives the integer division of the count `x` by 2.
   - `3 * (x // 2)` multiplies this result by 3.
   - `x % 2` gives the remainder of `x` when divided by 2 (i.e., 0 if `x` is even, 1 if `x` is odd).
   - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` multiplies the remainder by 1 if `i` is less than 3 (i.e., for counts of 1, 2, and 3) and by 0 if `i` is 3 (i.e., for the count of 4).

3. **Division by 3**: The sum calculated is then divided by 3 to get the final result for each test case.

4. **Output**: The results for all test cases are printed, each on a new line.

To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that the sum calculation and the final division by 3 correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` is designed to count the number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. However, this expression needs to be carefully analyzed to ensure it aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Analysis of the Expression:
- For each count `x` of 1, 2, or 3, the expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2` ensures that:
  - If `x` is even, `x // 2` gives the number of pairs, and `3 * (x // 2)` counts the number of times Bob can win by removing pairs.
  - If `x` is odd, `x // 2` gives the number of pairs, and `x % 2` adds one more win for Bob by removing the last odd number.

- For the count of 4, `x % 2 * (i < 3)` is always 0 because `i` is 3, so the count of 4 does not contribute to the sum.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1**: `1 1 1 0`
  - `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0`
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
  - Result: `3 // 3 = 1`
  - Correct output: `1`

- **Example 2**: `1 0 1 2`
  - `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0`
  - `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3`
  - Sum: `1 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 5`
  - Result: `5 // 3 = 1`
  - Correct output: `1`

- **Example 3**: `2 2 2 0`
  - `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3`
  - `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3`
  - `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3`
  - `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0`
  - Sum: `3 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 9`
  - Result: `9 // 3 = 3`
  - Correct output: `3`

- **Example 4**: `3 3 2 0`
  - `3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 3 + 1 = 4`
  - `3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 + 1 = 4`
  - `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3`
  - `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0`
  - Sum: `4 + 4 + 3 + 0 = 11`
  - Result: `11 // 3 = 3`
  - Correct output: `3`

- **Example 5**: `0 9 9 9`
  - `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0`
  - `3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 * 4 + 1 = 13`
  - `3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 * 4 + 1 = 13`
  - `3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 3 * 4 + 0 = 12`
  - Sum: `0 + 13 + 13 + 12 = 38`
  - Result: `38 // 3 = 12`
  - Correct output: `12`
