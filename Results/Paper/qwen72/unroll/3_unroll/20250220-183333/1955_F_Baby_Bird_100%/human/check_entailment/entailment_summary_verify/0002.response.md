### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - The game continues as Eve removes one number at a time from the sequence.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the sequence can be partitioned into pairs of identical numbers.
   - Removing a number from the sequence can change the XOR result.
   - The optimal strategy for Eve is to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.

3. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if the count of each number modulo 2 is zero.
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR zero by removing numbers that balance the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - The formula used in the program is: `sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3`
   - Let's break it down:
     - `x // 2` gives the number of pairs of each type of number.
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder when the count of each type of number is divided by 2.
     - `3 * (x // 2)` accounts for the pairs, and each pair can contribute to making the XOR zero.
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` accounts for the odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s (but not 4s, since `i < 3` is false for `i = 3`).
     - The sum of these values is then divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

4. **Verification**:
   - For the first test case: `1 1 1 0`
     - Pairs: `0` (1s), `0` (2s), `0` (3s), `0` (4s)
     - Odd counts: `1` (1s), `1` (2s), `1` (3s), `0` (4s)
     - Sum: `3 * (0 + 0 + 0 + 0) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
     - Result: `3 // 3 = 1`
   - For the second test case: `1 0 1 2`
     - Pairs: `0` (1s), `0` (2s), `0` (3s), `1` (4s)
     - Odd counts: `1` (1s), `0` (2s), `1` (3s), `0` (4s)
     - Sum: `3 * (0 + 0 + 0 + 1) + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5`
     - Result: `5 // 3 = 1`
   - For the third test case: `2 2 2 0`
     - Pairs: `1` (1s), `1` (2s), `1` (3s), `0` (4s)
     - Odd counts: `0` (1s), `0` (2s), `0` (3s), `0` (4s)
     - Sum: `3 * (1 + 1 + 1 + 0) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9`
     - Result: `9 // 3 = 3`
   - For the fourth test case: `3 3 2 0`
     - Pairs: `1` (1s), `1` (2s), `1` (3s), `0` (4s)
     - Odd counts: `1` (1s), `1` (2s), `0` (3s), `0` (4s)
     - Sum: `3 * (1 + 1 + 1 + 0) + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 10`
     - Result: `10 // 3 = 3`
   - For the fifth test case: `0 9 9 9`
     - Pairs: `4` (1s), `4` (2s), `4` (3s), `4` (4s)
     - Odd counts: `1` (1s), `1` (2s), `1` (3s), `1` (4s)
     - Sum: `3 * (4 + 4 + 4 + 4) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 48 + 4 = 52`
     - Result: `52 // 3 = 17`

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given problem description and the provided test cases.
   - The formula used in the program is mathematically sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.
