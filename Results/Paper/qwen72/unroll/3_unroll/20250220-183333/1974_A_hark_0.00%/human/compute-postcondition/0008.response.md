Initial State: `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. `x` is 0, and `y` is a positive integer greater than 0.

Given the code snippet:
```
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

Let's break down the steps to determine what will be printed:

1. **Variable `y`**: According to the initial state, `y` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99. This means `y` can take any value from 1 to 99.

2. **Expression `y / 2`**: This expression divides the value of `y` by 2. Since `y` is a positive integer, `y / 2` will be a floating-point number.

3. **Function `math.ceil(y / 2)`**: The `math.ceil` function rounds up the result of `y / 2` to the nearest integer. For example:
   - If `y` is 1, `y / 2` is 0.5, and `math.ceil(0.5)` is 1.
   - If `y` is 2, `y / 2` is 1.0, and `math.ceil(1.0)` is 1.
   - If `y` is 3, `y / 2` is 1.5, and `math.ceil(1.5)` is 2.
   - If `y` is 4, `y / 2` is 2.0, and `math.ceil(2.0)` is 2.
   - And so on...

4. **Output**: The `print` statement will output the result of `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Since `y` is a positive integer greater than 0, the output will be the ceiling of `y / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99)**
