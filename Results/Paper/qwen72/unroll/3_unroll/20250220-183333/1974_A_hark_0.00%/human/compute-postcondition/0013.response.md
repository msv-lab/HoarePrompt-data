The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `0`.

Based on the initial state:
- `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `x` and `y` are assigned values from the input.
- The condition states that either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0, or both.

However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `x` or `y`. It simply prints the constant integer `0`.

Output: **0**
