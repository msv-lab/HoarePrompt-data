To determine what will be printed by the `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
   - `x` is greater than 0.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `x` and `y` are assigned values from the input, but the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided. However, we know that `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `math.ceil` function is used to compute the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15.
   - The ceiling function, `math.ceil`, returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given number.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Since \(1 \leq x \leq 99\), the value of \(x / 15\) will be a floating-point number.
   - We need to determine the range of possible values for `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

   Let's consider the extreme values of `x`:
   - If \(x = 1\), then \(x / 15 = 0.0667\), and `math.ceil(0.0667)` is 1.
   - If \(x = 15\), then \(x / 15 = 1.0\), and `math.ceil(1.0)` is 1.
   - If \(x = 29\), then \(x / 15 = 1.9333\), and `math.ceil(1.9333)` is 2.
   - If \(x = 30\), then \(x / 15 = 2.0\), and `math.ceil(2.0)` is 2.
   - If \(x = 44\), then \(x / 15 = 2.9333\), and `math.ceil(2.9333)` is 3.
   - If \(x = 45\), then \(x / 15 = 3.0\), and `math.ceil(3.0)` is 3.
   - If \(x = 59\), then \(x / 15 = 3.9333\), and `math.ceil(3.9333)` is 4.
   - If \(x = 60\), then \(x / 15 = 4.0\), and `math.ceil(4.0)` is 4.
   - If \(x = 74\), then \(x / 15 = 4.9333\), and `math.ceil(4.9333)` is 5.
   - If \(x = 75\), then \(x / 15 = 5.0\), and `math.ceil(5.0)` is 5.
   - If \(x = 89\), then \(x / 15 = 5.9333\), and `math.ceil(5.9333)` is 6.
   - If \(x = 90\), then \(x / 15 = 6.0\), and `math.ceil(6.0)` is 6.
   - If \(x = 99\), then \(x / 15 = 6.6\), and `math.ceil(6.6)` is 7.

   Therefore, the possible values of `math.ceil(x / 15)` range from 1 to 7.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the ceiling of \(x / 15\), which is an integer between 1 and 7.

Output: **1 to 7 (where the exact value depends on the value of `x`)**
