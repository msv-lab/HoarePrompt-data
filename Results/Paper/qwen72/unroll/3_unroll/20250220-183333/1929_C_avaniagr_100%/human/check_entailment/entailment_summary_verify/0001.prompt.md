You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines and prints 'YES' if the value of `a` meets certain conditions based on `k` and `x`, and 'NO' otherwise. The conditions are as follows: if `x` is less than `k - 1`, `a` must be at least `x + 1`; if `x` equals `k - 1`, `a` must be at least `x + 2`; if `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `a` must be at least a calculated value `z`. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place a bet of `y` coins.
   - If he wins, he gets `y * k` coins back, increasing his total by `y * (k - 1)`.
   - If he loses, he loses `y` coins.
   - He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - Initially, Sasha has `a` coins.
   - We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee to have at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always recover from a series of losses because the number of consecutive losses is less than the number of times his bet is increased in case of a win. This means he can always place a bet that will eventually lead to a win and recover his losses.
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can recover from a series of `x` losses, but he needs at least `x + 2` coins initially to ensure he can place a bet after `x` losses and still have enough coins to recover.
   - If `x > k - 1`, Sasha needs to calculate the minimum number of coins required to ensure he can recover from `x` consecutive losses. This is because after `x` losses, he needs to have enough coins to place a bet that will recover his losses and still have some coins left.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it parses the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
   - It then checks the following conditions:
     - If `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, "NO".
     - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 2`. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, "NO".
     - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery from `x` consecutive losses. It then checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

4. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
     - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always recover from a series of losses because the number of consecutive losses is less than the number of times his bet is increased in case of a win. The program correctly checks if `a >= x + 1` to ensure he has enough coins to place a bet after `x` losses.
   - **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
     - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can recover from `x` losses, but he needs at least `x + 2` coins initially to ensure he can place a bet after `x` losses and still have enough coins to recover. The program correctly checks if `a >= x + 2`.
   - **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
     - If `x > k - 1`, the program calculates the minimum number of coins required to ensure recovery from `x` consecutive losses. The calculation is:
       - `z = k - 2`
       - For each additional loss beyond `k - 1`, it updates `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1`.
     - This calculation is intended to ensure that Sasha has enough coins to recover from `x` consecutive losses. However, the logic for updating `z` is not entirely clear and may not be correct for all cases.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The calculation of `z` in the `x > k - 1` case is not straightforward and may not correctly determine the minimum number of coins required to ensure recovery from `x` consecutive losses. This could lead to incorrect results for some test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is not entirely correct because the calculation of `z` in the `x > k - 1` case may not accurately determine the minimum number of coins required to ensure recovery from `x` consecutive losses.
