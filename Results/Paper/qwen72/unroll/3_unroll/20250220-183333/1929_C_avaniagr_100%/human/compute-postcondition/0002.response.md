The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`. The constraints for these parameters are: `2 <= k <= 30`, `1 <= x <= 100`, and `1 <= a <= 10^9`. The function is expected to return a result for each test case, but the specific output based on these parameters is not provided in the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function operates on multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` with constraints `2 <= k <= 30`, `1 <= x <= 100`, and `1 <= a <= 10^9`. It returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not defined in the problem statement.**
