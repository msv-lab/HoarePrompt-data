### Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the program is correct. Let's analyze the program and the function summary to determine if this is accurate.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to create a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to keep track of the residues of the array elements modulo `x` and `y`.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates two residues:
     - `r_x = -num % x`: This is the residue that, when added to `num`, would result in a sum divisible by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y`: This is the residue that, when subtracted from `num`, would result in a difference divisible by `y`.
   - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` is already in the `residue_map`. If it is, it adds the count of such pairs to the total count.
   - Finally, it updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating `r_x` and `r_y` is correct. For a pair `(a_i, a_j)` to be beautiful:
     - `a_i + a_j` must be divisible by `x`, which means `a_i % x + a_j % x` must be `0` modulo `x`.
     - `a_i - a_j` must be divisible by `y`, which means `a_i % y - a_j % y` must be `0` modulo `y`.
   - The program uses the residues to check if a pair can form a beautiful pair. Specifically, for a pair `(a_i, a_j)` to be beautiful:
     - `a_i % x` should be equal to `-a_j % x` (or `a_j % x` should be equal to `-a_i % x` modulo `x`).
     - `a_i % y` should be equal to `a_j % y`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem description.
   - It ensures that the input is processed correctly and that the `residue_map` is updated and queried for each element in the array.
   - The program does not explicitly handle empty arrays, but the problem guarantees that each array has at least 2 elements, so this is not an issue.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The calculation `r_x = -num % x` is correct for finding the required residue. However, it's worth noting that `-num % x` can be simplified to `x - (num % x)` to avoid negative residues, but this does not affect the correctness of the program.
   - The program correctly updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues and checks for the required residues to form a beautiful pair.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is sound and follows the problem description accurately. It correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as specified. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
