### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (n, x, y, and the array `arr`).
   - This part is correct and efficiently handles the input.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes a `count` variable to zero, which will store the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It also initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to keep track of the residues of the array elements modulo `x` and `y`.
   - This part is correct and sets up the necessary data structures for the problem.

3. **Residue Calculation**:
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, the program calculates two residues:
     - `r_x` is the residue of `-num` modulo `x`.
     - `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.
   - The program then checks if the tuple `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of such tuples to the `count` variable.
   - This part is correct in terms of the logic for checking the conditions. The use of residues ensures that the conditions for divisibility are met.

4. **Updating Residue Map**:
   - The program calculates the current key as `(num % x, num % y)` and updates the `residue_map` with this key, incrementing its count.
   - This part is correct and ensures that the `residue_map` is updated correctly for future lookups.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, the program appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - This part is correct and ensures that the output is formatted as required.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of Residue Calculation**:
  - The calculation of `r_x` as `-num % x` is correct because it ensures that the sum `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`. This is because if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`, then `a_i % x + a_j % x` must be zero modulo `x`, and thus `-a_i % x` should match `a_j % x`.
  - The calculation of `r_y` as `num % y` is correct because it ensures that the difference `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`. This is because if `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`, then `a_i % y - a_j % y` must be zero modulo `y`, and thus `a_i % y` should match `a_j % y`.

- **Correctness of Counting**:
  - The program correctly counts the number of pairs \((i, j)\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and both conditions are satisfied by using the `residue_map`.
  - The use of the `residue_map` ensures that the program efficiently counts pairs without needing to compare every possible pair, which would be \(O(n^2)\).

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program uses a dictionary to store the residues, which allows for efficient lookups and updates. This is crucial for handling large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.
  - The overall time complexity is \(O(n)\) for each test case, making it suitable for the given constraints.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where the array has only two elements correctly.
  - It also handles the case where there are no beautiful pairs correctly by initializing `count` to zero and not incrementing it if no valid pairs are found.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. It efficiently processes the input and handles all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
