To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are the elements of `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` contains at least one tuple. The state of `results` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is an empty list.**
