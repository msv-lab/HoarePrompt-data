### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (n, x, y, and the array `arr`).
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the input format described in the problem.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes a `results` list to store the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a `count` variable to zero and a `residue_map` dictionary to keep track of the residues of the array elements modulo `x` and `y`.

3. **Residue Calculation:**
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates two residues:
     - `r_x = -num % x` which is the residue of `-num` modulo `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` which is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.
   - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the `residue_map` and adds the count of such pairs to `count`.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, the function appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list, which contains the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Analysis of the Residue Calculation:
- The key idea is to use the residues of the elements modulo `x` and `y` to identify pairs that satisfy the conditions.
- For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) must be divisible by `x`.
  - \(a_i - a_j\) must be divisible by `y`.

- The residues `r_x` and `r_y` are used to check these conditions:
  - If \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x`, then \((-a_i) \mod x + a_j \mod x\) should be zero.
  - If \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y`, then \(a_i \mod y - a_j \mod y\) should be zero.

- The program correctly uses the residues to identify pairs that satisfy both conditions. The use of `residue_map` ensures that the program efficiently counts the pairs without needing to compare every pair explicitly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The input parsing, residue calculation, and output generation are all handled correctly.
