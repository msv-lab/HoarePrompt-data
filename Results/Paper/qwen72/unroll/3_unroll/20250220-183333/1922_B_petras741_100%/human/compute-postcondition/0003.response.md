Output State: **The variable `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. The variable `buffer` remains an empty list. For each test case, the loop has processed the input values `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and has printed the number of ways to choose 3 distinct indices i, j, k such that a_i = a_j = a_k. If n < 3, the loop prints 0 for that test case.**
