You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for forming a non-degenerate triangle with the given sticks. Specifically, the program fails to correctly count the number of valid triangles when there are multiple distinct lengths of sticks.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output a non-zero value, which is incorrect.

### Explanation of the Error:
The program attempts to count the number of ways to form a triangle by iterating through the distinct lengths of sticks and using a combination formula. However, it does not correctly handle the condition for forming a non-degenerate triangle, which is that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.

For the input `1 2 3 4`, the lengths of the sticks are `2^1 = 2`, `2^2 = 4`, `2^3 = 8`, and `2^4 = 16`. No three of these lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of the two smallest lengths is always less than or equal to the largest length. The program, however, does not correctly check this condition and may incorrectly count some combinations as valid.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Count the frequency of each stick length.
2. Iterate through all possible combinations of three stick lengths.
3. Check if the combination satisfies the triangle inequality theorem.
4. Count the valid combinations and return the result.

The provided program does not perform these steps correctly, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
