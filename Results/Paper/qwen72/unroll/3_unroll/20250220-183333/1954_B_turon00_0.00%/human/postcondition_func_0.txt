The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the minimum length of consecutive elements in the array `a` that are the same as the first element. If all elements in the array `a` are the same, it prints -1. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the program state is reset for the next call.
