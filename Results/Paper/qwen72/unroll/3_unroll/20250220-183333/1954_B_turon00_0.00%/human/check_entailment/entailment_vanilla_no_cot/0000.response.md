Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The program attempts to count consecutive elements that are the same as the first element and then finds the minimum count of such sequences. However, this approach does not consider the definition of a "beautiful" array and the specific operation allowed to make all elements the same.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Beautiful Array**:
   - The program does not check if the array is beautiful by the given definition (i.e., you can make all elements the same by the specified operation). Instead, it only checks if all elements are the same, which is not sufficient.
   - The program should identify the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent the array from being transformed into an array with all elements the same using the allowed operation.

2. **Handling of Single Element Arrays**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element and outputs `-1` because a single-element array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Handling of Arrays with All Elements the Same**:
   - The program correctly outputs `-1` for arrays where all elements are the same because it is impossible to make such an array non-beautiful by removing elements.

4. **Incorrect Minimum Element Removal Calculation**:
   - The program's logic for calculating the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It does not consider the operation that allows replacing an element with its neighbors if they are the same. This means it may not find the correct minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Identify the longest subarray where the elements can be made the same using the allowed operation.
2. Calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break this property.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_elements_to_remove_to_stop_beautiful():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        if len(set(a)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum number of elements to remove
        dp = [1] * n
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i - 1] == a[i + 1]:
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i] = 1
        
        # The maximum length of a subarray that can be made the same
        max_beautiful_length = max(dp)
        
        # If the maximum length is less than n, we can remove n - max_beautiful_length elements
        if max_beautiful_length < n:
            print(n - max_beautiful_length)
        else:
            print(-1)

min_elements_to_remove_to_stop_beautiful()
```

### Explanation:
- **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array**: The `dp` array is used to keep track of the length of the longest subarray that can be made the same by the allowed operation.
- **Update DP Array**: For each element `a[i]` where `2 <= i <= n-1`, if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`, then `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i] = 1`.
- **Maximum Beautiful Length**: The maximum value in the `dp` array gives the length of the longest subarray that can be made the same.
- **Result Calculation**: If the maximum length is less than `n`, then the minimum number of elements to remove is `n - max_beautiful_length`. If the maximum length is `n`, it means the entire array can be made the same, and the result is `-1`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
