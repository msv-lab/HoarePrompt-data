### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The function checks if all elements in the array `a` are the same by converting the array to a set `aa` and checking its length.
   - If `len(aa) == 1`, it means all elements are the same, and the function prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Counting Consecutive Elements**:
   - The function initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive elements that are the same as `tmp` using the variable `cnt`.
   - When it encounters an element that is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` with the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `ans`, which is supposed to be the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `-1`.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The function aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
- However, the logic of counting consecutive elements that are the same as the first element and then printing the minimum count does not correctly address the problem.
- The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent the array from being beautiful, which means preventing any operation from making all elements the same.
- The current logic only checks for consecutive elements that are the same as the first element, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
- To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the longest subarray where all elements are the same and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break this pattern.
- If the array is already non-beautiful (i.e., it does not have any subarray where all elements are the same), the answer is 0.
- If the array is beautiful, we need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the longest subarray of identical elements.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It only checks for consecutive elements that are the same as the first element, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correctness:
**False**
