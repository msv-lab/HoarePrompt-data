You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, the input is a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array, followed by an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) that is guaranteed to be beautiful. The total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        tmp = a[0]
        
        aa = set(a)
        
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the integer `n` and the array `a` for each test case, and prints the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element in the array `a`. If all elements in the array `a` are the same, it prints -1. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `cnt`, and `ans` are updated and used within the loop, but their final values after the loop are not relevant to the next test case, as they are reset for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and then counts the number of consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`. It then updates the minimum count of such consecutive elements. However, this approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.

In the given test case, the array is `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The program will count the number of consecutive `1`s, which are at the beginning and end of the array, and will output `2` (the minimum count of consecutive `1`s). However, the correct answer should be `1` because removing the last `1` will result in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider the entire structure of the array and identify the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the "beautiful" property. The current logic is too simplistic and does not account for all possible scenarios.
