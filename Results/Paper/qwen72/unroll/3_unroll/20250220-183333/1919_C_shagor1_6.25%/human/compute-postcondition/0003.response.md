Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `inp`. It then calculates the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than the two smallest distinct elements found in `inp` and prints this count. The function does not return any value, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `inp` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
