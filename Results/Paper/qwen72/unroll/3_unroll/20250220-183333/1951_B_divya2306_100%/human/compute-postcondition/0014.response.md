Functionality: ** The function `max_wins` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of cows), `k` (an integer representing your cow's index, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and `ratings` (a list of integers of length `n` where each integer represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow, with all ratings being distinct and within the range 1 to 10^9). The function calculates the maximum number of cows that can be defeated by your cow (at index `k-1`) in a competition, either without swapping or by swapping your cow with another cow. It prints the result and does not return any value. The values of `n`, `k`, and `ratings` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
