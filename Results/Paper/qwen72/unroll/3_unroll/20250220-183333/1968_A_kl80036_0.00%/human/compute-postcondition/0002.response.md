The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function will process a number of test cases `t` where `1 <= t <= 1000`, and for each test case, an integer `x` where `2 <= x <= 1000` is involved. The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to return or handle the results of these test cases based on the value of `x` for each case.

Since the exact output is not provided, we can infer that the function likely returns a list or a collection of results, one for each test case, where each result is derived from the value of `x` in that test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) and for each test case, it takes an integer `x` (2 <= x <= 1000) and returns a result based on the value of `x` for each test case.**
