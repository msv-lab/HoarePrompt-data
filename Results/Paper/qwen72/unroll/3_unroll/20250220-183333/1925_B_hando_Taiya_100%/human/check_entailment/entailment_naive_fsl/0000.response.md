Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1. In such a case, the only way to break `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of 1, making the GCD 1. However, the program does not account for this scenario and may return an incorrect result.

Example Input:
```
3
10 3
5 5
13 2
```

Expected Output:
```
2
1
1
```

Actual Output:
```
2
1
13
```

In the third test case, `x = 13` is a prime number, and `n = 2`. The only way to break 13 into 2 sub-problems is to have difficulties of 1 and 12, or 2 and 11, etc., all of which have a GCD of 1. However, the program incorrectly returns 13, which is not a valid solution since 13 cannot be divided into 2 sub-problems with the same difficulty.
