You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads two integers `x` and `n` from the user input, where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`. After processing, it prints the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n` or the largest quotient of `x` divided by a divisor that is greater than or equal to `n`. The original values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Approach:**
   - The GCD of a set of numbers is maximized when all the numbers in the set are multiples of the same number.
   - If we can find a divisor `d` of `x` such that `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems each with difficulty `d`, then `d` will be the GCD of these sub-problems.
   - We need to check all divisors of `x` and find the largest one that can be used to create `n` sub-problems.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - `func_1()` reads the values of `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - It checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The code correctly identifies all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - It checks both `i` and `x // i` to ensure that all divisors are considered.
   - The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` are used to ensure that `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems with the given divisor.
   - The `max` function is used to update `ans` with the largest valid divisor.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where `n` is equal to `x` (each sub-problem has difficulty 1).
   - The code handles the case where `n` is 1 (the GCD is `x` itself).
   - The code handles the case where `x` is a prime number (the GCD will be 1).

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The code is efficient as it only iterates up to the square root of `x`, which is a common optimization for finding divisors.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and follows the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly identifies the maximum GCD for the given constraints.
