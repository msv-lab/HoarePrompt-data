Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers provided by the user input, where 1 <= `n` <= `x`, `ans` is 0.** 

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, and the values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t`, `x`, and `n` are still valid.
