You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, a_i and b_i are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for c in range(cases):
        na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
        
        custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        na_frente -= 1
        
        pos_final -= 1
        
        total = 0
        
        best = sys.float_info.max
        
        for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
            if v <= pos_final:
                if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                    best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                    total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                else:
                    total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
            elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        
        print(best)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each case, and for each case, it calculates the minimum cost to move an element from a position `na_frente` to a position `pos_final` using the costs provided in `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. After all iterations, the variable `best` holds the minimum cost for the current case, and this value is printed. The variables `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `total` are reset for each new case. The loop variable `c` will have incremented by 1 for each iteration, and after the loop finishes, `c` will be equal to `cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t`, integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i` of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
