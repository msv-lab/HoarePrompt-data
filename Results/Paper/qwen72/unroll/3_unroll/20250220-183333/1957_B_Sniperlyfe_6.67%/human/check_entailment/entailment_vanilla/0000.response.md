Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The sequence should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is responsible for generating the sequence.
   - The sequence is initialized with `n` zeros: `nums = [0] * n`.
   - The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it sets `nums[i]` to the largest number that can be represented with the highest bit set in `k` and then subtracts this number from `k`.
   - Finally, it adds any remaining value of `k` to the last element of the sequence: `nums[-1] += k`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach sets each element of the sequence to the largest possible value that can be represented with the highest bit set in `k`. This ensures that the highest bit is set in as many elements as possible, which maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - By setting `nums[i]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, we are essentially setting `nums[i]` to a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit in `k`.
   - The subtraction `k -= nums[i]` ensures that the remaining value of `k` is used to set the last element of the sequence, which guarantees that the sum of the sequence is exactly `k`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is 1, the function will set `nums[0]` to `k`, which is correct.
   - If `k` is 0, the function will set all elements to 0, which is also correct.
   - If `k` is less than the largest number that can be represented with the highest bit set in `k`, the function will still correctly distribute the remaining value to the last element.

5. **Verification:**
   - The function correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k`.
   - The bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s because each element is set to a large number with many 1s, and the last element adjusts to ensure the sum is exactly `k`.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is correct as it prints each sequence on a new line, separated by spaces.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
