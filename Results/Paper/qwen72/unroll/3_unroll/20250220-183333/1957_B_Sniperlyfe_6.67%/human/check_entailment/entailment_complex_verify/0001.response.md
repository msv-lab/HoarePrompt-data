Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The sequence should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is responsible for generating the sequence.
   - The sequence is initialized with `n` zeros: `nums = [0] * n`.
   - The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it sets `nums[i]` to the largest number that can be represented with the highest bit set in `k` and then subtracts this number from `k`.
   - Finally, it adds any remaining value of `k` to the last element of the sequence: `nums[-1] += k`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach sets each element of the sequence to the largest possible value that can be represented with the highest bit set in `k`. This is done using `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit in `k`.
   - However, this approach has a critical flaw: it does not consider the sum constraint properly. Specifically, if `k` is less than `n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`, the function will incorrectly set each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which can lead to a sum greater than `k`.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the test case `n = 2, k = 3`:
     - The highest bit in `k` is 2 (since `3` in binary is `11`).
     - The function sets `nums[0]` to `(1 << 2 - 1) - 1 = 1` and subtracts 1 from `k`, making `k = 2`.
     - The function sets `nums[1]` to `(1 << 2 - 1) - 1 = 1` and subtracts 1 from `k`, making `k = 1`.
     - The function then adds the remaining `k` to `nums[1]`, making `nums[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`.
     - The resulting sequence is `[1, 2]`, which sums to 3 and has a bitwise OR of `3` (binary `11`), which is correct.
   - However, consider the test case `n = 3, k = 3`:
     - The highest bit in `k` is 2 (since `3` in binary is `11`).
     - The function sets `nums[0]` to `(1 << 2 - 1) - 1 = 1` and subtracts 1 from `k`, making `k = 2`.
     - The function sets `nums[1]` to `(1 << 2 - 1) - 1 = 1` and subtracts 1 from `k`, making `k = 1`.
     - The function sets `nums[2]` to `(1 << 2 - 1) - 1 = 1` and subtracts 1 from `k`, making `k = 0`.
     - The function then adds the remaining `k` to `nums[2]`, making `nums[2] = 1 + 0 = 1`.
     - The resulting sequence is `[1, 1, 1]`, which sums to 3 and has a bitwise OR of `1` (binary `1`), which is not optimal. The optimal sequence would be `[1, 2, 0]` or `[2, 1, 0]`, both of which have a bitwise OR of `3` (binary `11`).

5. **Flaw in the Approach:**
   - The function incorrectly assumes that setting each element to the largest possible value with the highest bit set in `k` will always lead to the correct solution. This is not true for all values of `n` and `k`.
   - A correct approach would involve distributing the bits more efficiently to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR while ensuring the sum constraint is met.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program does not always generate the correct sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence while maintaining the sum constraint.

Final: **False**
