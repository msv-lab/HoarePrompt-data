Reasoning:  
The goal of the program is to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. The function `func_1` attempts to achieve this by setting each of the first `n-1` elements to the maximum number that can be represented with the highest bit set in `k`, which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is essentially a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`. For example, if `k` is 10 (binary `1010`), then `(1 << 3) - 1` is 7 (binary `111`).

However, this approach has a critical flaw: the sum of `n-1` such numbers can easily exceed `k`, especially when `n` is large. The program then adds the remaining `k` to the last element, which can result in a number that is much larger than `k` and does not satisfy the condition that the sum of all elements should be `k`.

To illustrate, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 5`:
- The highest bit of `5` is `101`, so `(1 << 2) - 1` is `3` (binary `11`).
- The function sets the first element to `3` and the second element to `3 + (5 - 3) = 5`.
- The resulting sequence is `[3, 5]`, which sums to `8`, not `5`.

This violates the condition that the sum of the sequence should be `k`.

Correctness: **False**
