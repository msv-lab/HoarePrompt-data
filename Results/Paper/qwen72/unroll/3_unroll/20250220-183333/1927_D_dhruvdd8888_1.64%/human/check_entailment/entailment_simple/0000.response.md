### Reasoning:

1. **Function Call and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`, which is responsible for processing the array and queries.

2. **Function `func_1` Processing:**
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` itself.
   - It then processes the array to create a list `arr` of tuples. Each tuple `(start_index, end_index, value)` represents a contiguous segment of the same value in `nums`.
   - The variable `s` is used to track the start index of the current segment, and `num` is the current value of the segment.
   - The loop iterates through the array, and when a different value is encountered, it appends a tuple to `arr` and updates `s` and `num`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The program reads the number of queries and processes each query.
   - For each query, it uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after the query's left boundary `l`.
   - It then checks the segment boundaries to determine if there are different elements within the query range:
     - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it checks if the segment starts at the beginning of the array. If so, it prints `-1 -1` (no different elements). Otherwise, it prints the indices of the last element of the previous segment and the start of the current segment.
     - If the end of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` (no different elements).
     - If the end of the segment is less than `N`, it prints the start of the segment and the next element.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the array has only one unique value by ensuring that `arr` is correctly populated with segments.
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to efficiently find the relevant segment, which is important given the constraints on the number of queries and the size of the array.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the last segment. This is a valid approach, but it should be noted that the value `-1` is not in the range of valid array elements (1 to 10^6).
   - The condition `if tc > 5` and the debug print statement `if ppp == 23` are not necessary for the correctness of the program and can be removed for clarity.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly processes the array and queries as described in the problem.
- It efficiently finds the segments and checks the conditions to determine if there are different elements within the query range.
- The edge cases are handled appropriately, and the program adheres to the constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
