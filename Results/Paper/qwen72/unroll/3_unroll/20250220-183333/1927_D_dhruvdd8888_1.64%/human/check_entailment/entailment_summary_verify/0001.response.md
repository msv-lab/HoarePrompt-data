### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`, which reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.
   - The use of `sys.stdin.readline` inside `func_1` is a potential issue, but in this context, it is used to read input for each test case, which is appropriate. However, it is important to ensure that the input is read in the correct order and that the function does not interfere with the input stream of other test cases.

2. **Array Compression**:
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and compresses it into a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple represents a segment of the array with the same value.
   - Each tuple in `arr` contains `(start, end, value)` where `start` and `end` are the indices of the segment, and `value` is the value of the elements in that segment.
   - This compression helps in efficiently handling the queries by reducing the number of elements to check.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after the query start index `l`.
   - It then checks the segment boundaries to determine if there is a valid pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i \ne a_j` within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - The logic for handling the segment boundaries is flawed. Specifically:
     - If the segment starts after `l`, it checks if the previous segment can provide a valid pair. However, it incorrectly prints `s - 1, s` without ensuring that `s - 1` is within the query range `[l, r]`.
     - If the segment ends before `r`, it checks if the next segment can provide a valid pair. However, it incorrectly prints `s, e + 1` without ensuring that `e + 1` is within the query range `[l, r]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the segment ends exactly at `r` and the next segment does not exist. This can lead to incorrect output.
   - The program also does not handle the case where the segment starts at `l` and ends at `r` but all elements in the segment are the same, which should return `-1 -1`.

5. **Debugging Statements**:
   - The program includes some debugging statements that print the array and query details if `ppp == 23` and `tc > 5`. These statements are not part of the actual logic and can be ignored for correctness evaluation.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Input Management**: The program reads input inside `func_1`, which is appropriate for the given problem. However, it is crucial to ensure that the input is read in the correct order and that the function does not interfere with the input stream of other test cases.
- **Segment Handling**: The program correctly compresses the array and uses binary search to find segments, but it does not handle all edge cases correctly.
- **Output**: The program does not always produce the correct output for all queries due to the issues mentioned above, particularly in handling segment boundaries and edge cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has issues with handling segment boundaries and edge cases, which can lead to incorrect results for some queries. Specifically, it does not ensure that the indices it prints are within the query range `[l, r]` and does not handle the case where the segment ends exactly at `r` and the next segment does not exist.

Final: **False**
