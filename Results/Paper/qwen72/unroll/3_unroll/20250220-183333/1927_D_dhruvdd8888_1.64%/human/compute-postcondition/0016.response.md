The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and a list of queries `q`. Each query in `q` is a list of two integers `[l, r]` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The list `a` contains integers in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and the number of queries `q` is such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function should handle a number of test cases `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the values of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results for each query, where each result is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l-1:r]` (considering the query indices are 1-based).

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of `a`, and a list of queries `q` where each query is a list of two integers `[l, r]`. For each query, the function returns the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l-1:r]`. The function handles up to 10^4 test cases, with the sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5.**
