You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters `t`, `test_cases`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and for each test case, `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: The `cnt` dictionary will contain the count of each integer in the list `a` after the loop has finished executing. The keys in `cnt` will be the unique integers from `a`, and the values will be the number of times each integer appears in `a`. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, and `N` will remain unchanged.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: The loop will return the first integer `i` in the range `[0, N]` where `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0. If no such `i` is found, `t` will be the count of unique integers in `cnt` that appear exactly once, and the loop will return `N + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and removing them.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c`, while Bob does not.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` at the end of the game, assuming both players play optimally.
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from 0 to `N` and checks the count of each integer.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, Alice can pick it, and Bob will pick it on his turn, so `t` is incremented.
   - If `t` reaches 2 (meaning two integers have been picked by Alice and Bob) or if an integer `i` does not appear in `a`, the function returns `i`.

4. **Correctness of the Strategy:**
   - The strategy of counting the occurrences and checking the conditions is correct because:
     - If an integer `i` appears more than once, Alice can pick it, and Bob will pick it on his turn, but it will still be in `c` after both picks.
     - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, Alice can pick it, and Bob will pick it on his turn, so it will not be in `c` after both picks.
     - If an integer `i` does not appear in `a`, it will be the MEX of `c` because it is the smallest integer not present in `c`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` is empty or contains only one element correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same correctly.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count occurrences, which is efficient.
   - The iteration through the integers from 0 to `N` is also efficient, as it is linear in the size of the input.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
