Postcondition: ***The value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `arr` remains unchanged. `val` is set to the first element of `arr`. `cnt` is set to the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `val` found in the array. `ans` is set to the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and `cnt`. If `flag` was initially True, it remains True, and all consecutive elements in `arr` are the same. If `flag` was initially False, it remains False, and there are at least two consecutive elements in `arr` that are different.***
