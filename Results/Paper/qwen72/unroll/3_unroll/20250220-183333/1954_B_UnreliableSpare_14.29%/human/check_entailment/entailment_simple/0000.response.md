### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling the function `func_1()` for each one.
   - The function `func_1()` is expected to handle the input for each test case, but the function definition does not include parameters. This is a potential issue, but since the function reads input directly, it is not a critical error for the given problem.

2. **Checking for All Elements Being the Same:**
   - The function `func_1()` first reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
   - It then checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and setting a `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If all elements are the same (`flag` remains `True`), the function prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove:**
   - If the array is not all the same (`flag` is `False`), the function initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and `val` to the first element of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are equal to `val` and updates `ans` to the minimum count of such sequences.
   - Finally, it updates `ans` to the minimum of the last sequence count and prints `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For arrays where all elements are the same, the function correctly outputs `-1`.
   - For arrays where elements are not all the same, the function correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Efficiency and Correctness:**
   - The function uses a straightforward approach to solve the problem, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is a bit overkill for this problem, as a simple large integer like `float('inf')` or a large constant would suffice. However, this does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the problem as described. It correctly identifies when an array is all the same and when it is not, and it finds the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The approach is logically sound and matches the problem requirements.

**Correctness: **True****

However, it is worth noting that the function `func_1()` should ideally take parameters to make the code more modular and easier to test. The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is also unnecessary and could be simplified. Despite these minor issues, the program is functionally correct.
