Output State: **The value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `arr` remains unchanged. The value of `flag` will be False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different; otherwise, `flag` will remain True. `ans` is set to the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and `cnt`. `val` is set to the first element of `arr`. `cnt` is set to the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `val` found in the array.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
- The values of `n`, `arr`, `flag`, and `val` remain unchanged.
- The value of `cnt` is also unchanged, but it is mentioned in the output state for completeness.
