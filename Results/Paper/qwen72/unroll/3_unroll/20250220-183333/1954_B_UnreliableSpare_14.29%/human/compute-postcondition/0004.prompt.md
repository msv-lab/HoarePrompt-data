Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The array `a` is a beautiful array, meaning it can be modified to have all elements the same by performing the specified operation. The length of the array `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element `a_i` of the array is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `n` is assigned the value of an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. `flag` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
        flag = False
        break


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
