### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle**:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting an odd-length side will result in two smaller rectangles that, when combined, will always form the same \(a \times b\) rectangle or its 90-degree rotation.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input.
   - It checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
   - If the condition is false, it prints 'No'.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies whether either `a` or `b` is even.
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, it prints 'Yes', which is correct because Bob can form a new rectangle.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'No', which is correct because Bob cannot form a new rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description and constraints accurately.

Correctness: **True**
