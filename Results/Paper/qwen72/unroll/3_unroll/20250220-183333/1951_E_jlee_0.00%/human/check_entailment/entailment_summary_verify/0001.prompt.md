You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    t = int(input())

        done = False
        if n == 1:

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it takes a string `string` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |string| ≤ 10^6). The function checks if the string can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the original string are different, or if the string can be split into two non-empty substrings where the first and last characters are the same but the string is not a palindrome. If either condition is met, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting substrings. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the results for each test case, and the variables `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, `x`, `count`, and `count2` will hold their final values from the last test case processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` and converts it to a list of characters.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the length of the string `n` is 1, the program correctly prints "NO" because a single character string is always a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **First and Last Character Check:**
   - The program checks if the first and last characters of the string are different. If they are, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring. This is correct because a string with different first and last characters cannot be a palindrome.

4. **All Characters the Same:**
   - The program checks if all characters in the string are the same using `s.count(x) == n`. If they are, it prints "NO" because any substring of a string with all characters the same is a palindrome.

5. **Almost All Characters the Same:**
   - The program checks if all characters except one are the same using `s.count(x) == n - 1`. If this condition is met, it further checks if the string length is odd and the middle character is different from `x`. If so, it prints "NO" because the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.

6. **General Case:**
   - The program iterates through the first half of the string and checks for the first pair of characters that are different.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - If no such pair is found, it uses additional logic to find a valid partition of the string into two non-palindromic substrings:
     - It keeps track of the first position `count` where a character different from `x` is found.
     - It also keeps track of the second position `count2` where another character different from `x` is found.
     - If both `count` and `count2` are valid, it prints "YES" and the partition of the string into two substrings.
     - If the conditions for a valid partition are not met, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the General Case Logic:
- The logic for finding the first and second positions of characters different from `x` is somewhat complex and could be simplified.
- However, the program correctly handles the cases where the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings by ensuring that the substrings are not palindromes.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic for handling the general case could be more straightforward and easier to understand.
- The use of `count` and `count2` variables is a bit convoluted, but it does seem to cover the necessary conditions for partitioning the string.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the given cases correctly and follows the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
