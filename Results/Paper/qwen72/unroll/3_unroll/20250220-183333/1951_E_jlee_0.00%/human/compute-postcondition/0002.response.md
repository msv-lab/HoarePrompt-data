Output State: **The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed either 'YES' or 'NO' followed by additional information if 'YES'. The variables `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, `x`, `count`, and `count2` will have their final values after the last test case has been processed. The list `s` will contain the characters of the last processed string, and `n` will be the length of that string. The variable `done` will be `True` if the last test case was processed and a 'YES' condition was met, otherwise it will be `False`. The variables `x`, `count`, and `count2` will hold the last values they were set to during the processing of the last test case.**
