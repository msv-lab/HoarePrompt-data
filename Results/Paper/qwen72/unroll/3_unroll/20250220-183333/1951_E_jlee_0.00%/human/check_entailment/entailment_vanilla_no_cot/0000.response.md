Correctness: **False**

The given program has some issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all cases. Here are the main issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Palindromic Strings**: The program incorrectly prints "YES" with a single substring for any string where the first and last characters are different, even if the rest of the string forms a palindrome. For example, for the string "abba", the program will output "YES" with a single substring "abba", which is incorrect because "abba" is a palindrome.

2. **Complex and Inefficient Logic**: The logic for handling cases where the string has more than one unique character is overly complex and may not cover all edge cases. For example, the program does not correctly handle cases where the string has a single character that is different from the rest, and the string length is even.

3. **Incorrect Partitioning**: The program does not always find a valid partition when one exists. For example, for the string "uwuowouwu", the program should be able to find a valid partition, but it does not.

### Corrected Program
Here is a corrected version of the program that should work for all cases:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        if not is_palindrome(string):
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            continue
        
        # Try to partition the string into two non-palindromic parts
        for i in range(1, n):
            if not is_palindrome(string[:i]) and not is_palindrome(string[i:]):
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:i], string[i:])
                break
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation
1. **Check for Single Character Strings**: If the string has only one character, it is a palindrome, and the program correctly prints "NO".

2. **Check if the String is Already Non-Palindromic**: If the entire string is not a palindrome, the program correctly prints "YES" with the entire string as the single part.

3. **Partition the String**: If the string is a palindrome, the program tries to partition it into two non-palindromic parts. It iterates through possible partition points and checks if both parts are non-palindromic. If such a partition is found, it prints "YES" with the two parts. If no such partition is found, it prints "NO".

This corrected program should handle all cases correctly and efficiently.
