The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `s` is a list of strings, where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters, and the length of each string is constrained by 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, we can only describe the parameters it accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of strings `s` where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters. It processes these inputs to produce a result, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
