Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element at index `i` with its adjacent element `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`. The program processes multiple test cases, each with a different array.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Finding Consecutive Same Elements:**
   - The program initializes `same` to 1, which counts the length of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - It also initializes `minn` to infinity (`inf`), which will store the minimum length of consecutive same elements found in the array.
   - The program iterates through the array `ar` using a while loop.

3. **Counting Consecutive Same Elements:**
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as the previous element `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element `ar[i]`.

4. **Final Check and Output:**
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means there are no consecutive same elements, and the program prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Elements:**
  - The program incorrectly increments `i` by 1 when it finds a different element, which can lead to skipping elements and incorrect counting.
  - The program should not increment `i` by 1 when it finds a different element; instead, it should continue to the next element.

- **Incorrect Minimum Length Calculation:**
  - The program calculates the minimum length of consecutive same elements, but it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
  - The correct approach should be to find the minimum length of consecutive same elements and then determine if removing one element from this sequence can make the array non-beautiful.

- **Special Case Handling:**
  - The program does not handle the case where all elements in the array are the same correctly. It should print -1 in such cases because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
