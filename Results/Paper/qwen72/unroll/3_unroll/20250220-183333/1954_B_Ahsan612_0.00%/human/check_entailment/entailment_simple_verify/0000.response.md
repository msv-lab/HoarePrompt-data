### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful.
   - A beautiful array is defined such that for any index \(i\) (2 ≤ \(i\) ≤ \(n-1\)), \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\) allows \(a_i\) to be replaced with \(a_{i-1}\).
   - If it is impossible to make the array not beautiful, the output should be -1.

2. **Initial Assessment:**
   - The initial assessment states that the program does not handle the case where the array is already not beautiful.
   - It also points out that the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed and may not handle more complex cases correctly.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The program iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - It initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array, incrementing `same` if the current element is the same as `num`, and updating `minn` when a different element is found.
   - Finally, it checks if `minn` is still `inf` and prints -1 if so, otherwise it prints `minn`.

4. **Evaluating the Program:**
   - **Case 1: Array is already not beautiful.**
     - The program does not explicitly check if the array is already not beautiful. However, the problem guarantees that the input array is beautiful, so this case is not relevant.
   - **Case 2: All elements are the same.**
     - If all elements are the same, the program will set `minn` to the length of the array, and since `minn` is not `inf`, it will print the length of the array. This is incorrect because the array will remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed.
   - **Case 3: Array has elements that can be made not beautiful by removing a minimum number of elements.**
     - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same and prints this value. However, it does not consider the optimal way to remove elements to break the beautiful property.
     - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will output 1, which is correct.
     - In the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program will output 3, which is also correct.
   - **Case 4: Array cannot be made not beautiful by removing elements.**
     - If the array is such that removing any number of elements will not break the beautiful property, the program will output -1. However, the logic to determine this is flawed.

5. **Flaws in the Program:**
   - The program does not handle the case where all elements are the same correctly. It should output -1 in this case.
   - The program does not consider the optimal way to remove elements to break the beautiful property. It simply finds the minimum length of consecutive elements and assumes removing one element from the smallest group will suffice, which is not always correct.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where all elements are the same and does not provide a robust solution for finding the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.

**Final: False**
