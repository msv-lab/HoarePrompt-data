### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment.

#### Problem Understanding:
- An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index \(i\) (2 ≤ \(i\) ≤ |a| - 1) such that \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\) and replacing \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\).
- The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. If it's impossible, output -1.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
- It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same.
- When a different element is encountered, it updates `minn` to the minimum of the current `minn` and the count of consecutive elements (`same`).
- Finally, it prints `minn` if it is not `inf`, otherwise it prints -1.

#### Original Assessment:
- The assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already not beautiful.
- It also mentions that the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Handling Already Not Beautiful Arrays:**
   - The program does not explicitly check if the array is already not beautiful. However, the problem guarantees that the input array is always beautiful, so this is not a concern for the given constraints.

2. **Logic for Finding Minimum Elements to Remove:**
   - The program's logic is to find the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - This approach is based on the idea that removing elements from the shortest consecutive segment will break the beautiful property.
   - For the example `1 2 1 2 1`, the program correctly identifies that removing one element (e.g., the last 1) will make the array not beautiful.
   - For the example `3 3 3 5 3 3 3`, the program correctly identifies that removing three elements (e.g., the first three 3s) will make the array not beautiful.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Elements the Same:**
     - If all elements in the array are the same, the program will output -1, which is correct because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.
   - **Single Element Array:**
     - For a single element array, the program will output -1, which is correct because a single element array is not beautiful and cannot be made not beautiful by removing elements.
   - **Array with No Consecutive Same Elements:**
     - The problem guarantees that the array is beautiful, so this case is not applicable.

4. **Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the logic used.
   - The program iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements and updating the minimum count.
   - The final check ensures that if no consecutive elements are found, it prints -1, which is correct for the given problem constraints.

#### Conclusion:
- The program's logic is correct for the given problem constraints.
- It correctly handles the cases where the array is already not beautiful (guaranteed not to happen) and where the array is beautiful.
- The program's approach to finding the minimum number of elements to remove is robust and meets the requirements of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
