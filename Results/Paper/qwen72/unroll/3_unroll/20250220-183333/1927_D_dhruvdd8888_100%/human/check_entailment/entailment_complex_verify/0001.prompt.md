You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `N` representing the length of an array `nums`, followed by the array itself. The function then reads a number of queries `q`, each consisting of a pair of integers `(l, r)`. For each query, the function determines and prints a pair of indices `(s, e)` such that `s` and `e` are the start and end of a segment in `nums` where all elements are the same, and the segment overlaps with the range `[l, r]`. If no such segment exists, it prints `(-1, -1)`. After processing all queries, the function leaves the input variables `N`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, and `LA` in their final states as described in the annotations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the length of the array `N`.
   - It reads the array `nums` and appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of the array.
   - It initializes variables `s` (start index), `e` (end index), and `num` (current number).
   - It creates an empty list `arr` to store tuples of the form `(start, end, number)`.

3. **Building the `arr` List:**
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and groups consecutive identical elements.
   - For each group, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr`, where `1 + s` is the start index of the group, `i` is the end index of the group, and `num` is the value of the elements in the group.
   - It updates `s` to the current index `i` and `num` to the current element `nums[i]`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of queries `q`.
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the start index is greater than or equal to `l`.
   - It retrieves the tuple `(s, e, _)` from `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`, where `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
   - It checks various conditions to determine if there is a pair of different elements within the range `(l, r)`:
     - If `s > l`, it checks if `s == 1` or `s > r` to determine if there is a valid pair.
     - If `e >= r`, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no valid pair.
     - If `e < N` or `e < l`, it prints `(s, e + 1)` as a valid pair.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1: `s > l`**
  - This means the start of the current group is greater than `l`.
  - If `s == 1` or `s > r`, it means the group starts at the beginning or outside the range, so no valid pair exists.
  - Otherwise, it prints `(s - 1, s)` as a valid pair.

- **Condition 2: `e >= r`**
  - This means the end of the current group is greater than or equal to `r`.
  - If this is true, it means the entire range `(l, r)` is within a single group of identical elements, so no valid pair exists.

- **Condition 3: `e < N` or `e < l`**
  - This means the end of the current group is within the array and not before `l`.
  - It prints `(s, e + 1)` as a valid pair.

- **Else:**
  - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Issues:
- **Appending Sentinel Value:**
  - The program appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases. However, this might not be necessary if the logic is correctly implemented.

- **Indexing and Conditions:**
  - The conditions and indexing logic are complex and might not cover all edge cases correctly.
  - For example, the condition `if s > l` might not always be the correct check for finding a valid pair.

- **Output Format:**
  - The program does not separate outputs for different test cases with empty lines, which is not a mandatory requirement but might be expected for clarity.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is complex and might not handle all edge cases correctly. The conditions for determining valid pairs are not robust enough, and the sentinel value might introduce unnecessary complexity.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has logical issues and might not correctly handle all edge cases, especially in the conditions used to determine valid pairs.
