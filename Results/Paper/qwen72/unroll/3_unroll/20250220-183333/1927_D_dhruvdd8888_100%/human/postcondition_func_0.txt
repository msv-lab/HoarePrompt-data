The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `N` representing the length of an array `nums`, followed by the array itself. The function then reads a number of queries `q`, each consisting of a pair of integers `(l, r)`. For each query, the function determines and prints a pair of indices `(s, e)` such that `s` and `e` are the start and end of a segment in `nums` where all elements are the same, and the segment overlaps with the range `[l, r]`. If no such segment exists, it prints `(-1, -1)`. After processing all queries, the function leaves the input variables `N`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, and `LA` in their final states as described in the annotations.
