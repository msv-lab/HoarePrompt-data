You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains: n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the array a; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries; each query is a pair of integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: `N` is the same integer value read from the input, `nums` is the same list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the start and end indices of a segment in `nums` that contains the same integer value, and the integer value itself.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: N remains the same, nums remains the same, s remains N, e remains 0, num remains -1, arr remains the same, LA remains len(arr) - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, the array `a` itself, an integer `q` representing the number of queries, and a list of `q` query pairs `(l, r)`. For each query, the function returns a result based on the elements of the array `a` within the range `[l, r]`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
