t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
