You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function operates in an interactive environment to determine the maximum XOR of any two elements in a fixed permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. For each input `n`, the function makes a series of queries to identify the indices of the two elements that achieve this maximum XOR and prints these indices. After processing all inputs, the final state of the program includes the variables `mak` and `mak2` holding the indices of the elements that achieve the maximum XOR for the last input `n`, and the list `pans` containing the indices of the elements that are equal to `mak2` in the last permutation. All other variables will be in their final state as determined by the last iteration of the loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \(3n\) queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
   - The interactor is not adaptive, meaning the permutation \(p\) is fixed for each test case.

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \(n\).

3. **Finding the Maximum Element:**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and queries \((p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_{\text{mak}})\) vs \((p_i \mid p_i)\).
   - If the result is "<", it updates `mak` to \(i\). This step is to find the index of the maximum element in the permutation \(p\).

4. **Finding the Second Maximum Element:**
   - The program initializes `mak2` to the value of `mak`.
   - It iterates through all indices \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\) and queries \((p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_{\text{mak2}})\) vs \((p_i \mid p_{\text{mak2}})\).
   - If the result is "<", it updates `mak` to \(i\) and resets `pans` to \([i]\).
   - If the result is "=", it appends \(i\) to `pans`. This step is to find indices that could potentially form the maximum XOR with `mak2`.

5. **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0.
   - It iterates through the indices in `pans` and queries \((p_{\text{pans}[mak]} \mid p_{\text{pans}[mak]})\) vs \((p_{\text{pans}[i]} \mid p_{\text{pans}[i]})\).
   - If the result is ">", it updates `mak` to \(i\). This step is to find the index in `pans` that maximizes the XOR with `mak2`.

6. **Output the Result:**
   - The program outputs the indices `mak2` and `mak` as the answer.
   - It flushes the output to ensure the result is sent to the interactor.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Finding the Maximum Element:**
  - The first loop correctly finds the index of the maximum element in the permutation \(p\). This is because \(p_i \mid p_i = p_i\), and the maximum element will be the one that is not less than any other element.

- **Finding the Second Maximum Element:**
  - The second loop is designed to find indices that could potentially form the maximum XOR with `mak2`. However, the logic here is flawed. The program is not correctly identifying the second maximum element. It is only checking if the current index \(i\) is less than `mak2` in terms of bitwise OR, which does not necessarily help in finding the maximum XOR.

- **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
  - The third loop is intended to find the maximum XOR among the potential candidates stored in `pans`. However, the logic is incorrect because it is comparing the bitwise OR of the same elements, which is not relevant to the XOR operation.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly identify the second maximum element or the maximum XOR pair. The logic for the second and third loops is flawed, and it does not ensure that the maximum XOR is found.

### Correctness:
**False**
