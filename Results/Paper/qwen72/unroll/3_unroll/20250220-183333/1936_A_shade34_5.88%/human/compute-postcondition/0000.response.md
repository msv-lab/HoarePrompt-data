The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range determined by the input. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state of the function's environment and the input `n` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
