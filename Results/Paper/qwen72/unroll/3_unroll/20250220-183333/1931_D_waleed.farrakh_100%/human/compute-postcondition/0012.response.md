Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from standard input, processes it, and constructs a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, where `n` is an integer representing the size of the array, `x` and `y` are Polycarp's favorite integers, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array. The function returns this list of test cases.**
