### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing in `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It then parses the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it parses the next two lines to get `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It appends these values as a tuple to the `test_cases` list.
   - This part of the code correctly handles the input format as specified in the problem description.

2. **Processing Each Test Case in `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case in the `test_cases` list.
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `rx` and `ry` as the remainders when `-a` is divided by `x` and `a` is divided by `y`, respectively.
     - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs to the `results` list.

3. **Output in `func_2`**:
   - After processing all test cases using `func_1`, it prints each result in the `results` list.
   - This part of the code correctly handles the output format as specified in the problem description.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correct Calculation of Remainders**:
  - The calculation of `rx` and `ry` is correct. `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, and `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
  - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always a non-negative integer, which is necessary for dictionary key consistency.

- **Frequency Dictionary**:
  - The dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
  - This is efficient and ensures that we can quickly check if a pair has been seen before and how many times.

- **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
  - The logic for counting beautiful pairs is correct. For each element `a`, it checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before in the array.
  - If it has, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `count` of beautiful pairs.
  - This ensures that we count all pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and the conditions for a beautiful pair are met.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The solution is efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, where \(n\) is the length of the array.
  - The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the use of the frequency dictionary.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. It handles the input and output formats correctly, and the logic for counting beautiful pairs is sound and efficient.

**Correctness: True**
