The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from standard input, processes it, and constructs a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. `n` is an integer representing the size of the array, `x` and `y` are Polycarp's favorite integers, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array. The function then calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints each result from `func_1` to the console. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, `test_cases` contains the constructed test cases, and `results` contains the output of `func_1`. The variable `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`. No other variables are affected.
