### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input and processes it to construct a list of test cases.
   - Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - The input is split into lines, and the first line is used to determine the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, the function reads the next two lines to extract `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - The function then calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.

2. **Processing Test Cases (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(rx, ry)`, where `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is `a % y`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`.
   - If the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the dictionary `freq`, it increments the `count` by the value associated with `(rx, ry)` in `freq`.
   - It then updates the dictionary `freq` with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies pairs `(a, b)` such that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - The key insight is that for a pair `(a, b)` to be beautiful, `a % x` and `b % x` must be equal (or their negatives must sum to `x`), and `a % y` and `b % y` must be equal.
   - The function uses a dictionary to efficiently count the number of such pairs.

4. **Output**:
   - The function `func_2` prints the results for each test case, which are the counts of beautiful pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The input handling and the counting logic are both correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
