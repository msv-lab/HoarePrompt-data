Output State: The variable `t` retains its initial value, which is the integer conversion of the first element of the list `data`. The variable `test_cases` is now a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is `(n, x, y, arr)`. Each `n` is an integer representing the size of the array, `x` and `y` are Polycarp's favorite integers, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array. The variable `idx` is now `2 * t + 1`. No other variables are affected.
