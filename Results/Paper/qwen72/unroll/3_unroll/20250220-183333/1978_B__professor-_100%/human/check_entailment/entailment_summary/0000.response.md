### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is because selling at the modified price would not increase the profit.
     - The function correctly prints `n * a` in this case.
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series: `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
     - The function correctly prints this value.
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `a + 1`, which is `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2)`.
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is `a * (n - (b - a))`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts: `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.
     - The function correctly prints this value.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as `n = 1`, `a = 1`, and `b = 1` correctly.
   - It also handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` (up to `10^9`) as required by the problem constraints.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions and calculations described above.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns, considering the different conditions and edge cases as specified in the problem description.
