You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program:
from math import ceil
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

#Function 2:
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`, where `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` ≤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. It updates two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, such that `arr[left:right + 1]` is filled with a sequence of integers starting from `left + 1` to `right + 1` in a specific pattern: the first half of the range is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`, and the second half is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. The `cliquess` list is updated to contain the value `clique` for all indices from `left` to `right + 1`. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
   - We then add edges between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - Each vertex should belong to exactly one clique.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques needed and initializes the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - `make_array` is responsible for assigning values to the vertices and determining the clique each vertex belongs to.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)` calculates the number of cliques needed. This is based on the idea that each clique can cover up to `k` vertices.
   - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to store the assigned values and the clique assignments, respectively.
   - The loop iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to assign values and cliques to the vertices.

4. **Function `make_array`:**
   - `small_element = left + 1` and `big_element = right + 1` determine the range of values to be assigned to the vertices in the current clique.
   - `mid` and `not_mid` are used to split the vertices into two halves.
   - The first loop assigns the smaller values to the first half of the vertices in the current clique.
   - The second loop assigns the larger values to the second half of the vertices in the current clique.
   - Both loops also assign the clique number to the corresponding vertices.

5. **Checking the Edge Condition:**
   - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) needs to be satisfied for the vertices to form a clique.
   - The way `make_array` assigns values ensures that the difference between the values of any two vertices in the same clique is at most `k - 1`, which satisfies the edge condition.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly calculates the number of cliques needed.
- The `make_array` function assigns values and cliques in a way that ensures the edge condition is met.
- The output format matches the problem requirements.

However, there is a potential issue with the `make_array` function:
- The `mid` calculation should be `mid = (right - left + 1) // 2` instead of `mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2` to correctly split the range of vertices.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (right - left + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
```

### Final Correctness:
- After correcting the `mid` calculation, the program should work correctly for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
