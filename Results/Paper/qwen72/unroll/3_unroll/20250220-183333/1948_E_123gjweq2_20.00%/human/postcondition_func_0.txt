The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `2 <= n <= 40` and `1 <= k <= 2n`. It calculates the number of cliques as the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`. The function then creates a list `arr` of length `n` where the first `k` elements are 1, the next `k` elements are 2, and so on, up to the last segment which will be filled with the value `cliques`. It prints the list `arr`, the number of cliques, and a list `cliquess` of `n` zeros. The function does not return any value.
