Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `k` is larger than `n`. According to the problem description, the graph should be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques, and each vertex should belong to exactly one clique. However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `make_array` does not ensure that the graph is correctly partitioned into cliques when `k` is larger than `n`.

For example, consider the input `n = 8` and `k = 16`. The expected output should be a single clique containing all vertices, as `k` is large enough to ensure that all pairs of vertices `(i, j)` satisfy the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k`. However, the current implementation will incorrectly partition the vertices into multiple cliques, as it always divides the vertices into `ceil(n / k)` cliques, which in this case would be `1` clique, but the `make_array` function incorrectly assigns elements to the array, leading to an incorrect partition.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:
- Input: `n = 8`, `k = 16`
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
  1
  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
  1
  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  ```

However, the `make_array` function is not correctly filling the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays, leading to an incorrect partition. The program should be revised to handle such cases correctly.
