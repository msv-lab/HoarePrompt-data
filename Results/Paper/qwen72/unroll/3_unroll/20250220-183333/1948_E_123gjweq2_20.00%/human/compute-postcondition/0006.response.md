The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `not_mid`. For the loop to execute, `not_mid` must be greater than 0. The state of `i` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the `range` function. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `not_mid` is greater than 0.

State: **`left` and `right` remain the same, `clique` remains the same, `small_element` remains the same, `big_element` remains the same, `mid` remains the same, `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `arr[left:mid]` is updated to `[small_element, small_element + 1, ..., small_element + (mid - 1)]`, and `cliquess[left:mid]` is updated to `[clique, clique, ..., clique]`**
