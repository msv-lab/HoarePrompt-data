The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`, where `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` â‰¤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. It updates two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, such that `arr[left:right + 1]` is filled with a sequence of integers starting from `left + 1` to `right + 1` in a specific pattern: the first half of the range is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`, and the second half is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. The `cliquess` list is updated to contain the value `clique` for all indices from `left` to `right + 1`. The function does not return any value.
