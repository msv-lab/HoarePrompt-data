You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3. It prints the pairs (1, 1), (1, 2), and for each integer `i` from 3 to `n`, it prints the pair (i, i). The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and prints the coordinates of \( n \) cells.
   - The first two cells are always placed at \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - The remaining cells are placed at \((i, i)\) for \( i \) from 3 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Output:**
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - The cells are \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances is \(\{1\}\) (since \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)).
     - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - The cells are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances is \(\{1, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4\}\), which simplifies to \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\).
     - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - The cells are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances is \(\{1, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 7\}\), which simplifies to \(\{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}\).
     - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 6, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 5 \):
     - The cells are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances is \(\{1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 8, 9, 8, 9, 10, 9, 10, 11\}\), which simplifies to \(\{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\}\).
     - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 10, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 6 \):
     - The cells are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\).
     - The set of Manhattan distances is \(\{1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 9, 10, 11, 12, 11, 12, 13, 12, 13, 14\}\), which simplifies to \(\{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\}\).
     - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 13, which is correct.

4. **General Analysis:**
   - The program places the first two cells at \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), which ensures a distance of 1.
   - The remaining cells are placed on the diagonal from \((3, 3)\) to \((n, n)\), which ensures a variety of distances.
   - The distances between the cells on the diagonal and the first two cells will cover a range of values, maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program appears to correctly place the cells to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for the given test cases.
   - The logic of placing cells on the diagonal and the first two cells at \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) is sound and should work for any \( n \) within the given constraints.
