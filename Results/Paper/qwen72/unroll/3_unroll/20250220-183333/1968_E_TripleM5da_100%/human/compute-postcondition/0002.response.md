The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function will process a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, and there are `t` such test cases where 1 <= t <= 50. The function should return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3 and returns a result for each test case.**
