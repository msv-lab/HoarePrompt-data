Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. For example, consider the case when \(n = 3\). The program outputs the points \((1,1)\), \((1,2)\), and \((3,3)\). The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{1, 2, 4\}\), which has a size of 3. However, a better arrangement that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \((2,1)\), \((2,3)\), and \((3,1)\), which results in the set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), with a size of 4. Therefore, the program does not always provide the optimal solution.
