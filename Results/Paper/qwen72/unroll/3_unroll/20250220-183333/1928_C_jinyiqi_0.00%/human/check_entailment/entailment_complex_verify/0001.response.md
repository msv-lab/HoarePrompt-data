### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem describes a pattern of numbering in a line where the first \( k \) people are numbered from 1 to \( k \), the next \( k-2 \) people are numbered from \( k-1 \) to 2, and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - Vasya remembers his position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received. We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) fit this pattern.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), \( n \) must be congruent to \( x \) or \( 2k-1-x \) modulo \( 2k-2 \).
   - This can be rewritten as:
     - \( n - x \equiv 0 \pmod{2k-2} \)
     - \( n - (2k-1-x) \equiv 0 \pmod{2k-2} \) which simplifies to \( n + x - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k-2} \).

3. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - We need to find \( k \) such that \( n \equiv x \pmod{2k-2} \) or \( n \equiv 2k-1-x \pmod{2k-2} \).
   - This can be rewritten as:
     - \( n - x \equiv 0 \pmod{2k-2} \)
     - \( n + x - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k-2} \).

4. **Divisors and Valid \( k \)**:
   - We need to find all divisors of \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 2 \) that are of the form \( 2k-2 \).
   - For each divisor \( d \), \( k \) can be calculated as \( k = \frac{d + 2}{2} \).
   - \( k \) must be a natural number greater than 1 and \( k \geq x \).

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even.
   - It calls `func_1` to find all divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It filters the divisors to ensure \( k \) is a natural number greater than 1 and \( k \geq x \).
   - It uses a set to remove duplicates and then prints the number of valid \( k \).

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of a given number \( x \).
   - It iterates from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \) and checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( i \).
   - It appends both \( i \) and \( \frac{x}{i} \) to the list of divisors.
   - It reverses the list of smaller divisors and concatenates it with the list of larger divisors.

7. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It correctly filters the divisors to find valid \( k \).
   - It uses a set to ensure that each \( k \) is counted only once.
   - The logic for checking the conditions \( k > 1 \) and \( k \geq x \) is correct.

8. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - The function `func_1` correctly returns all divisors of \( x \) in the specified format.
   - The main loop correctly processes each test case and applies the necessary conditions to find valid \( k \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
