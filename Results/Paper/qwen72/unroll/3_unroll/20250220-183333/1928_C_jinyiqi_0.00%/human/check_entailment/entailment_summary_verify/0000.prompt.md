You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) and returns a list of all divisors of `x`. The list contains divisors greater than the square root of `x` in their original order, followed by divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it handles the calculation and the conditions for valid `k` values. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of a given number, but the main logic for determining valid `k` values is not correctly implemented.

### Issue 1: Missing Output for Each Test Case
The program does not print the output for each test case. The `output` list is populated with valid `k` values, but it is not printed or returned. This means that the program will not produce any output for the test cases, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

### Issue 2: Incorrect Handling of Divisors
The program uses the function `func_1` to find divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`. However, the conditions for adding these divisors to the `output` list are not correctly formulated. Specifically, the conditions `if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x` are not always correct for determining valid `k` values.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
1
10 2
```
The correct output should be `4` because the valid `k` values are `2, 3, 5, 6`. However, the program does not correctly handle this case and will not produce the correct output.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Find all divisors of `n - x` and `n + x - 2`.
2. Check if each divisor plus 2 is even and greater than or equal to `x`.
3. Ensure that the divisor plus 2 is a valid `k` by checking the constraints of the problem.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def find_divisors(x):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != x // i:
                divisors.append(x // i)
    return divisors

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    valid_ks = set()
    
    for s in find_divisors(n - x):
        k = (s + 2) // 2
        if k > 1 and k >= x:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    
    for s in find_divisors(n + x - 2):
        k = (s + 2) // 2
        if k > 1 and k >= x:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    
    print(len(valid_ks))
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases and prints the output for each test case.
