The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip). The list `a` must contain at least one chip (1). The function should be called in a loop or similar construct to process each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of length `n`. It returns information about the placement of chips in the ribbon, ensuring that the list `a` contains at least one chip.**
