Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string `arr` of length `n` where each character is either '0' (free cell) or '1' (cell with a chip). For each test case, it prints the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the initial state of the input `t` (number of test cases) is unchanged, and the function has printed the count of free cells for each test case. **
