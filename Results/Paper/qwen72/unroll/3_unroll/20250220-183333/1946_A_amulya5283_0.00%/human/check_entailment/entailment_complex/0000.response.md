### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and the individual test cases, storing them in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is necessary to determine the median correctly.

3. **Median Calculation:**
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct for both odd and even lengths of the array, as the median is the middle element in a sorted array.

4. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is done to efficiently manage the smallest elements that are greater than or equal to the current median.

5. **Operations to Increase Median:**
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. Each increment is counted as an operation.
   - This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is used to increase the median.

6. **Result Collection:**
   - The number of operations required for each test case is appended to the `results` list.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Correctness:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles the input and output as specified. It uses a heap to efficiently manage the operations required to increase the median, ensuring that the minimum number of operations is used.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
