### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the array `arr` from the list.
   - This approach is efficient for reading large inputs, which is important given the constraints (up to 10^4 test cases and each array can have up to 10^5 elements).

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Sorting is necessary to determine the median, which is the middle element for odd-length arrays and the element at the higher middle index for even-length arrays.

3. **Median Calculation:**
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct because for an array of length `n`, the median is the element at index `n // 2` in the sorted array.
   - For even-length arrays, the median is the element at index `n // 2`, which is the higher middle index.

4. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A min-heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is done to efficiently manage the smallest elements that need to be incremented to increase the median.
   - The heap is used to keep track of the smallest elements that are greater than or equal to the current median.

5. **Incrementing Elements:**
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
   - Each time an element is incremented, the number of operations is increased by 1.
   - This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is used to increase the median.

6. **Result Collection:**
   - The number of operations required for each test case is collected in the `results` list.
   - Finally, the results are printed for each test case.

### Correctness:

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input in a loop and storing each test case in a list.

- **Median Calculation:**
  - The median calculation is correct for both odd and even-length arrays.

- **Heap Operations:**
  - The use of a min-heap to increment the smallest elements is efficient and ensures the minimum number of operations.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly outputs the number of operations required for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
