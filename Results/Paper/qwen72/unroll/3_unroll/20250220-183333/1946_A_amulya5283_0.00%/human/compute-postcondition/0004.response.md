The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `test_cases` is a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple `(n, a)`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns a list `results` which contains integers. Each integer in `results` represents the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the sorted array of each test case greater than the median of that array. The length of `results` is equal to `t`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple `(n, a)`, where `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element in `results` is the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the sorted array of each test case greater than the median of that array.**
