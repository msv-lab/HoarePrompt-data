### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the array `arr` from the list.
   - This approach is efficient for reading large inputs, which is important given the constraints (up to 10^4 test cases and each array can have up to 10^5 elements).

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Sorting is necessary to determine the median, which is the middle element for odd-length arrays and the element at the higher middle index for even-length arrays.

3. **Median Calculation:**
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct because for an array of length `n`, the median is the element at index `n // 2` in the sorted array.
   - For even-length arrays, the median is the element at index `n // 2`, which is the higher middle index.

4. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A min-heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is done to efficiently manage the smallest elements that need to be incremented to increase the median.
   - The heap is used to keep track of the smallest elements that are greater than or equal to the current median.

5. **Incrementing Elements:**
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
   - Each time an element is incremented, the number of operations is increased by 1.
   - This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is used to increase the median.

6. **Result Collection:**
   - The number of operations required for each test case is collected in the `results` list.
   - Finally, the results are printed for each test case.

### Function Summary Review:
- The function summary states that `func_1` returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element in `results` represents the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the sorted array of each test case greater than the median of that array.
- However, the actual task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array, not just to make the smallest element greater than the median.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Median Calculation:**
  - The median is correctly identified as the element at index `n // 2` in the sorted array.
- **Heap Operations:**
  - The heap is initialized with elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is correct because these are the elements that need to be considered for incrementing to increase the median.
  - The while loop increments the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. This ensures that the minimum number of operations is used to increase the median.
- **Output:**
  - The program correctly outputs the number of operations required for each test case.

### Issues:
- The function summary is slightly misleading. It should state that the function returns the number of operations required to increase the median, not just to make the smallest element greater than the median.
- However, the actual implementation of `func_1` correctly addresses the problem by incrementing the smallest elements in the heap until the median is increased.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles multiple test cases, calculates the median, uses a heap to efficiently increment the necessary elements, and outputs the correct number of operations for each test case.

Final: **True**
