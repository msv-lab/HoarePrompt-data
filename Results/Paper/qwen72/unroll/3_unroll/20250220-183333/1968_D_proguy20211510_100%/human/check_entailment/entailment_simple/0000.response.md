### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and converts them to integers.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the path for Bodya and Sasha by following the permutation `p` starting from their respective positions `P_B` and `P_S`.
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops. This is crucial because the permutation can form cycles, and the program correctly handles this by breaking the loop when a position is revisited.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by summing the values from the array `a` at each position in their paths.
   - It uses a `preb` and `pres` variable to keep track of the cumulative score up to the current turn.
   - The score for each turn is calculated as `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for Bodya and `curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for Sasha. This formula is intended to account for the remaining turns and the score at each position, but it seems to be incorrect. The correct approach should be to sum the scores for each turn up to `k` and then compare the final scores.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program compares the final scores `resb` and `ress` and prints the result accordingly.
   - The comparison logic is correct, but the score calculation logic is flawed.

### Correctness:

The program has a logical error in the score calculation. Specifically, the formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` (and similarly for Sasha) is incorrect. The correct approach should be to sum the scores for each turn up to `k` and then compare the final scores. The current formula incorrectly multiplies the score at each position by the remaining number of turns, which does not accurately reflect the game rules.

### Corrected Score Calculation:

The correct score calculation should be:

```python
for i in range(k):
    resb += a[pb - 1]
    pb = p[pb - 1]
    if pb == P_B:
        break

for i in range(k):
    ress += a[ps - 1]
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if ps == P_S:
        break
```

This ensures that the scores are summed correctly for each turn, and the loop breaks if the player returns to their starting position, which is a common scenario in permutations with cycles.

### Conclusion:

Given the logical error in the score calculation, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
