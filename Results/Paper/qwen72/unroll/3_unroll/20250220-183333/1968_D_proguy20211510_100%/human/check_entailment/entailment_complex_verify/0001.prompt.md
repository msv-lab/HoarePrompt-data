You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: The loop executes all iterations, and for each test case, it prints either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of `resb` and `ress`. The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres` are updated within the loop, but their final values after the loop are not explicitly defined in the output state. The loop itself does not modify the values of `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, or `alpha`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible score for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their movements through a permutation `p` and the values in array `a`. The function then prints the result of the game for each test case, which can be 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw', depending on which player has the higher score or if they have the same score. The function does not return any values, and it does not modify the global variables `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, or `alpha`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` from the input.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions in the permutation.
   - It starts from `pb` and follows the permutation `p` to build the path for Bodya, stopping when it encounters a previously visited position.
   - Similarly, it starts from `ps` and follows the permutation `p` to build the path for Sasha, stopping when it encounters a previously visited position.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by iterating through their respective paths.
   - For each position in the path, it calculates the potential score if the player stays at that position for the remaining turns.
   - It updates the maximum score for each player by comparing the current score with the potential score.

4. **Output:**
   - After calculating the scores, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Issues and Corrections:

1. **Unnecessary Variables:**
   - The variables `YES`, `NO`, and `MOD` are defined but not used in the program. These can be removed to clean up the code.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The cycle detection logic is correct, but it can be optimized. The current implementation may not handle cycles efficiently, especially if the cycle is large.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The score calculation logic is incorrect. The current implementation assumes that the player can stay at a position for multiple turns, which is not how the game is described. The player can either stay or move to `p_x` on each turn.
   - The correct approach should be to simulate the game for `k` turns, keeping track of the score and the current position for each player.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def simulate_game(start, k):
            score = 0
            pos = start
            for _ in range(k):
                score += a[pos - 1]
                pos = p[pos - 1]
            return score
        
        bodya_score = simulate_game(pb, k)
        sasha_score = simulate_game(ps, k)
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` from the input.

2. **Simulation Function:**
   - The `simulate_game` function simulates the game for a given starting position and number of turns `k`.
   - It initializes the score to 0 and the current position to the starting position.
   - It iterates `k` times, adding the score at the current position and moving to the next position according to the permutation `p`.

3. **Score Comparison:**
   - The program calls the `simulate_game` function for both Bodya and Sasha to get their final scores.
   - It then compares the scores and prints the result accordingly.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program's score calculation logic is incorrect, and it does not simulate the game as described in the problem statement. The corrected program accurately simulates the game and determines the winner correctly.
