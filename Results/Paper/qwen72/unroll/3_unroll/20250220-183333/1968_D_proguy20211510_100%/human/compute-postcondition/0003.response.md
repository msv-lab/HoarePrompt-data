The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range(int(input()))` function. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, `alpha`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
