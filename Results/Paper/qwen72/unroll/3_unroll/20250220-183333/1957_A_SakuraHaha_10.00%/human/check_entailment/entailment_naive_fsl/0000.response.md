Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of regular polygons. Specifically, the program assumes that all polygons must have 4 sides (squares), but the problem description allows for the construction of regular polygons with any number of sides (3 or more). For example, with the input:

```
1
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
```

The correct output should be 1, as we can form one square with the four sticks of length 3. However, the program outputs 0 because it only checks for the possibility of forming squares, not other regular polygons. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
