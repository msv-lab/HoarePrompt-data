You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers representing stick lengths, and n. t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and each n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. Each stick length a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `ans` is 0, `n` is the same input integer, `a` is the same list of integers input by the user, `t` is the same integer, and `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple of stick lengths from the list `a`, and each value is the count of how many times that tuple appears in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt` by 4, `n` is the same input integer, `a` is the same list of integers input by the user, `t` is the same integer, and `cnt` is the same dictionary.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the floor division of each value in the dictionary `cnt` by 4)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of regular polygons. Specifically, the program assumes that all polygons must have 4 sides (squares), but the problem description allows for the construction of regular polygons with any number of sides (3 or more). For example, with the input:

```
1
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
```

The correct output should be 1, as we can form one square with the four sticks of length 3. However, the program outputs 0 because it only checks for the possibility of forming squares, not other regular polygons. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
