You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of stick lengths, and then reads `n` integers from the user, representing the stick lengths. It then counts the occurrences of each stick length and calculates the number of groups of four identical stick lengths. The function prints this count and does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the integer `n`, the list of integers `a` (which are the stick lengths), and the dictionary `cnt` (which maps each stick length to its count). The printed value is the sum of the floor division of each count in `cnt` by 4.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the number of sticks `n` for the current test case.
   - It reads the lengths of the sticks into a list `a`.
   - It initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.
   - It creates a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length.

3. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program iterates over the list `a` and updates the dictionary `cnt` to count how many times each stick length appears.

4. **Calculating the Number of Polygons:**
   - The program iterates over the values in the dictionary `cnt` (which represent the counts of each stick length).
   - For each count `x`, it adds `x // 4` to `ans`. This is because a regular polygon with at least 4 sides can be formed using 4 sticks of the same length, and `x // 4` gives the number of such polygons that can be formed with `x` sticks.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Polygons:**
  - The program assumes that only squares (4-sided polygons) can be formed, which is incorrect. Regular polygons can have more than 4 sides.
  - For example, in the third test case, the program should be able to form a square with 4 sticks of length 3, but it should also be able to form other regular polygons like equilateral triangles (3-sided) or pentagons (5-sided) if there are enough sticks of the same length.

### Correct Calculation:
- To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider all possible regular polygons, not just squares. For each stick length `x`, the number of polygons that can be formed is `x // k` where `k` is the number of sides of the polygon. The maximum number of polygons that can be formed is the sum of `x // k` for all possible `k` (3, 4, 5, ...).

### Conclusion:
- The program is incorrect because it only considers squares and not other regular polygons.

### Correctness:
**False**
