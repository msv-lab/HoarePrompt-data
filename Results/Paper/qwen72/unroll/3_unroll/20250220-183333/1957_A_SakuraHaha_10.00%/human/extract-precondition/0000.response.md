Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t, a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers representing stick lengths, and n. t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and each n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. Each stick length a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to properly reflect the input parameters:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the stick lengths for a test case. The precondition for this corrected function definition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and test_cases is a list of t lists, where each inner list contains n integers representing stick lengths, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. Each stick length a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.**
