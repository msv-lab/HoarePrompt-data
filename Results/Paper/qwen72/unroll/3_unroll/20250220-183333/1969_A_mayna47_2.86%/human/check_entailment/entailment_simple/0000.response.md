Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, given the constraints and the best friend relationships. Let's break down the program and analyze its correctness based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.
   - It initializes a list `v` of length `n + 1` with the first element as 0 and the remaining elements as the integers provided by the input.

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`:**
   - If `n` is 2, the function prints 2 and returns immediately. This is correct because if there are only 2 friends, Monocarp must invite both to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **General Case for `n > 2`:**
   - The function iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1` and checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`.
   - If this condition is met, it prints 2 and returns immediately.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a triplet, it prints 3.

### Analysis of the General Case:
- **Condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i`:**
  - This condition checks if there is a cycle of length 3 in the best friend relationships. If such a cycle exists, Monocarp can invite any two friends in the cycle to ensure that both come to the party.
  - For example, if `v = [0, 3, 1, 2, 4]`, then `v[v[v[1]]] = v[v[3]] = v[2] = 1`, which forms a cycle of length 3.

- **If no such cycle is found:**
  - The function prints 3. This is based on the assumption that if there is no cycle of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.
  - However, this assumption is not always correct. Consider the case where `n = 4` and `v = [0, 2, 3, 4, 1]`. Here, there is no cycle of length 3, but Monocarp can still invite friends 1 and 2, and both will come to the party because friend 1's best friend is 2, and friend 2's best friend is 3 (who is not invited, but that's not a requirement for friend 2 to come).

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the special case when `n == 2`.
- However, the general case logic is flawed. The program should consider all possible pairs of friends and check if inviting both friends in a pair will ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The current logic only checks for cycles of length 3, which is not sufficient.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios for `n > 2` correctly. It fails to consider pairs of friends that can be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

Correctness: **False**
