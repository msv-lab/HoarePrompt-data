Postcondition: **If `n` is 2, the function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers `p` of length `n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function is called multiple times with different values of `n` and `p`, as specified by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. `n` is an input integer and has a current value of 2. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with the first element as 0 and the remaining elements as integers provided by the input. If `n` is not 2, the function either prints 2 and returns immediately, or it completes the loop without printing anything. The values of `n`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged.**
