Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic used to determine the minimum number of invitations is flawed. The program checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i` and prints 2 if this condition is met, otherwise it prints 3. This logic is incorrect because it does not consider the structure of the best friend relationships, which can form cycles or chains.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
2 3 4 5 1
```
In this case, the friends form a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1. To have at least 2 friends attend the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to 2 friends who are consecutive in the cycle. However, the program will print 3, which is incorrect.

The correct approach should involve identifying the smallest cycle or chain that can be broken to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. The program provided does not do this, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
