The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `p`. `n` is an integer representing the number of friends, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `p_i` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) represents the best friend of friend `i`. The function is called multiple times, with the number of test cases specified by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000).

For each test case, the function returns a string indicating whether the best friend relationships form a valid cycle among the friends. If the relationships form a valid cycle, the function returns "Valid Cycle"; otherwise, it returns "Invalid Cycle".

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 2 and 50) and `p` (a list of integers of length `n` where each element `p_i` is a distinct integer between 1 and `n` and `p_i` is not equal to `i`). The function is called `t` times (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) with different values of `n` and `p`. For each test case, it returns "Valid Cycle" if the best friend relationships form a valid cycle, or "Invalid Cycle" otherwise.**
