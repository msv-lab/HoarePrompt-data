Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling the `func_1` function for each one.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function reads the number of friends `n` and initializes a list `v` of length `n + 1` with the first element as 0. It then reads the list of best friends `p` and stores it in `v` starting from index 1. This is a correct way to handle the input and align the indices with the problem's requirements.
   - **Special Case for `n == 2`**: The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 2 by printing 2 and returning. This is correct because if there are only 2 friends, both must be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - **Cycle Detection**: The function checks for a cycle of length 3 by iterating through the friends and checking if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a cycle is found, it prints 2 and returns. This is correct because if a cycle of length 3 is found, inviting any two friends in the cycle will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - **Default Case**: If no cycle of length 3 is found, the function prints 3 and returns. This is correct because in the absence of a cycle of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.

3. **Output**: The function prints the correct output for each test case, either 2 or 3, based on the conditions described.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 2.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is greater than 2 and there is a cycle of length 3.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is greater than 2 and there is no cycle of length 3.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
