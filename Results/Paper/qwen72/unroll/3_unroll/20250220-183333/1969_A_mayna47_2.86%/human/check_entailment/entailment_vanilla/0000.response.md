### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.
   - It initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, where the first element is 0 (to make the list 1-indexed).

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`:**
   - If `n` is 2, the program correctly prints 2 and returns. This is because if there are only 2 friends, Monocarp must invite both to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **General Case for `n > 2`:**
   - The program iterates over each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition is true if the best friend of the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself. This indicates a cycle of length 3, where each friend in the cycle is the best friend of another friend in the cycle.
   - If such a cycle is found, the program prints 2 and returns. This is because inviting any two friends in the cycle will ensure that both of them come to the party, as each of them has an invitation and their best friend also has an invitation.
   - If no such cycle is found, the program prints 3. This is because the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3, as there are no cycles of length 3, and inviting 3 friends will ensure that at least 2 of them come to the party.

5. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is used to detect cycles of length 3. This is a valid approach because it checks if the best friend of the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself, which is a characteristic of a cycle of length 3.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == 2` correctly.
   - For `n > 2`, the program correctly identifies cycles of length 3 and prints 2 if such a cycle is found. If no cycle of length 3 is found, it prints 3, which is the correct minimum number of invitations needed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem by identifying cycles of length 3 and handling the special case where `n == 2`. It ensures that the minimum number of invitations is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
