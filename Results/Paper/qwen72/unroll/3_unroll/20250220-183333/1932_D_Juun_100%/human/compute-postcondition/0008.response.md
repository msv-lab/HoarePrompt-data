Output State: **The `trumps` list is empty or contains the remaining ranks of the trump suit cards that were not paired with any non-trump suit cards. The `answers` list contains strings representing pairs of cards, where each pair consists of a card from a non-trump suit that was only encountered once and a card from the `trumps` list. If the `trumps` list was not long enough to pair with all non-trump suit cards, the loop will print 'IMPOSSIBLE' and return, leaving the `trumps` list potentially non-empty and the `answers` list with the pairs that were successfully added. The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged, with `None` for all suits that were encountered more than once and the rank of the last card seen for any suit that was only encountered once.**
