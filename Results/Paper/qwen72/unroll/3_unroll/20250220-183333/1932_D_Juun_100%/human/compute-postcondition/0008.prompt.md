Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `trumps` list contains all the ranks of the cards that have the same suit as the `trump_suit`. The `answers` list contains strings representing pairs of cards that were compared and added to the list when a card of a non-trump suit was encountered and the suit had already been seen before. The `suits` dictionary has the value `None` for all suits that were encountered more than once, and the rank of the last card seen for any suit that was only encountered once.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
