Reasoning:

The program `func_1` is designed to solve the problem of determining whether there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. Let's break down the logic and verify if it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The function initializes a variable `possible` to `False`.
   - It iterates over each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, then `a` and `b` can both match a template with an uppercase letter at position `i` (since they are the same and `c` is different), so it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks the loop.
     - If `a[i]` is different from `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `a` and `b` can both match a template with a lowercase letter at position `i` (since they are different and `c` is different from both), so it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks the loop.
     - If `a[i]` is different from `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, it continues to the next position (since `c` matches one of `a` or `b` at this position, it cannot be a valid template).

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - `n = 1`
  - `a = "a"`, `b = "b"`, `c = "c"`
  - At position 0: `a[0] = "a"`, `b[0] = "b"`, `c[0] = "c"`
  - `a[0]` is different from `b[0]` and `c[0]` is different from both `a[0]` and `b[0]`.
  - The program sets `possible` to `True` and prints 'YES'.

- **Example 2**:
  - `n = 2`
  - `a = "aa"`, `b = "bb"`, `c = "aa"`
  - At position 0: `a[0] = "a"`, `b[0] = "b"`, `c[0] = "a"`
  - `c[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, so the program continues to the next position.
  - At position 1: `a[1] = "a"`, `b[1] = "b"`, `c[1] = "a"`
  - `c[1]` is equal to `a[1]`, so the program continues to the next position.
  - The loop ends without setting `possible` to `True`, so the program prints 'NO'.

- **Example 3**:
  - `n = 10`
  - `a = "mathforces"`, `b = "luckforces"`, `c = "adhoccoder"`
  - At position 0: `a[0] = "m"`, `b[0] = "l"`, `c[0] = "a"`
  - `c[0]` is different from both `a[0]` and `b[0]`.
  - The program sets `possible` to `True` and prints 'YES'.

- **Example 4**:
  - `n = 3`
  - `a = "acc"`, `b = "abd"`, `c = "abc"`
  - At position 0: `a[0] = "a"`, `b[0] = "a"`, `c[0] = "a"`
  - `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]` and `c[0]` is also equal to `a[0]`.
  - The program continues to the next position.
  - At position 1: `a[1] = "c"`, `b[1] = "b"`, `c[1] = "b"`
  - `c[1]` is equal to `b[1]`, so the program continues to the next position.
  - At position 2: `a[2] = "c"`, `b[2] = "d"`, `c[2] = "c"`
  - `c[2]` is equal to `a[2]`, so the program continues to the next position.
  - The loop ends without setting `possible` to `True`, so the program prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all the provided examples and follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
