Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if there is at least one position `i` where either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different, or `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are no longer relevant as they are overwritten in each iteration. **
