Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any. The correct function definition should include an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        possible = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                continue
            else:
                possible = True
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The function `func_1` will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed 'YES' if there was at least one position `i` where `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` was different, or if `c[i]` was different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, it will have printed 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will no longer hold their initial values, as they are overwritten in each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if there is at least one position `i` where either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different, or `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are no longer relevant as they are overwritten in each iteration.
