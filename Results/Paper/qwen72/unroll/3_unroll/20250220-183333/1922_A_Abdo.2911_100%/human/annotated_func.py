#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any. The correct function definition should include an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        possible = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                continue
            else:
                possible = True
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The function `func_1` will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed 'YES' if there was at least one position `i` where `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` was different, or if `c[i]` was different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, it will have printed 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will no longer hold their initial values, as they are overwritten in each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if there is at least one position `i` where either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different, or `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are no longer relevant as they are overwritten in each iteration.
