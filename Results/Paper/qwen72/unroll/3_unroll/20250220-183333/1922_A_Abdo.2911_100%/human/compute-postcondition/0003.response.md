The function `func_1` is intended to accept parameters, but the provided function definition does not include any. The correct function definition should include an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function should then process these inputs and return a result based on the provided constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function is expected to accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
