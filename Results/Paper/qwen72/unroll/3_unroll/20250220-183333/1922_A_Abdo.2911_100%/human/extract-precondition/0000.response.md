Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any. The correct function definition should include an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**

To correct the function definition, it should be:
```
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```
Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.
