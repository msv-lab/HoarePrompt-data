### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Template Matching Conditions:**
   - The function needs to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
     - `a` and `b` match the template.
     - `c` does not match the template.
   - The conditions for matching a template are:
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is lowercase, then `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is uppercase, then `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

3. **Logic for Determining the Template:**
   - The function iterates through each position `i` of the strings.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`:
     - The template at position `i` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
     - If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), then `c` does not match the template, and the function sets `possible` to `True`.
     - This logic is correct.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`:
     - The template at position `i` can be any uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
     - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `c` matches the template, and the function continues to the next position.
     - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `c` does not match the template, and the function sets `possible` to `True`.
     - This logic is also correct.

4. **Output:**
   - After iterating through all positions, if `possible` is `True`, the function prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - This part is correctly implemented.

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
  - If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), then `c` does not match the template.
  - This logic is correct and aligns with the problem description.

- **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` can be any uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
  - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `c` matches the template, and the function continues to the next position.
  - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `c` does not match the template.
  - This logic is also correct and aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The conditions and the flow of the program are consistent with the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the program is correct.
