Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by checking if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The logic within the function `func_1` is as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The program iterates over each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, it checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`, since they are the same). If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, it checks if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it continues to the next position.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `possible` is `False`, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and `c[i]` is different.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different and `c[i]` is different from both.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies when a template `t` exists such that `a` and `b` match it, and `c` does not.
   - The logic ensures that if any position `i` meets the criteria, the program will print 'YES' and move to the next test case.

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and produce the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
