Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` in the function `func_1` is actually the correct logic for determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Let's break down the problem and the condition:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Nikita can either add or remove one cube in each move.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

2. **Analyzing the Condition**:
   - **`n - m >= 0`**: This ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the number of cubes `m` that we want to end up with. This is necessary because if `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - **`(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This ensures that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` is even. This is crucial because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the net effect of an even number of moves (after achieving `m` cubes) will be zero (i.e., the number of cubes remains unchanged). If the difference is odd, it means that after achieving `m` cubes, there will be one extra move that will either add or remove a cube, making it impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

3. **Example Test Cases**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
     - `n - m = 0` (which is even and non-negative)
     - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because it is possible to add 3 cubes in 3 moves.
   - **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
     - `n - m = -2` (which is negative)
     - The program correctly outputs "No" because it is impossible to have 4 cubes after 2 moves.
   - **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
     - `n - m = 2` (which is even and non-negative)
     - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because it is possible to add 3 cubes in 3 moves and then remove or add 2 more cubes to balance out the total number of moves.

4. **Correctness of the Condition**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` correctly captures the essence of the problem. It ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to reach the desired number of cubes and that the remaining moves can be balanced out to maintain the desired number of cubes.

Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect, and the program is actually correct.

Final: **True**
