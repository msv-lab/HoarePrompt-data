Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `kreker`, and then iterates over each test case. This is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is called for each test case, but it is defined without parameters. However, inside the function, it reads `n` and `m` from the input. This is a logical error because the function should be defined with parameters `n` and `m` to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, m):`.

3. **Logic for Determining Tower Height**:
   - The condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is non-negative and even.
   - If the difference is non-negative and even, it means Nikita can achieve the tower height `m` after `n` moves. This is because each move can either add or remove a cube, and the total number of moves must be even to balance out the additions and removals to reach exactly `m` cubes.
   - If the difference is not non-negative and even, it means Nikita cannot achieve the tower height `m` after `n` moves, and the program correctly prints "No".

4. **Output**: The program outputs "Yes" or "No" based on the condition, which is correct according to the problem description.

However, the function definition is incorrect and should be fixed to accept parameters `n` and `m`.

Corrected Program:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, m)

def func_1(n, m):
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

Given the original program, the function definition is incorrect, which affects the overall correctness of the program.

Correctness: **False**
