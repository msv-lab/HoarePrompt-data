Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether, after `n` moves, it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower. Each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower. Therefore, the key observation is that the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves can be expressed as `m = n - 2k` where `k` is the number of times a cube is removed. This equation implies that `n - m` must be even and non-negative for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` and checks if `n - m` is a non-negative even number. If so, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

However, there is a minor issue in the program: the function `func_1` should be defined with parameters `n` and `m` to match the problem description. The function should be defined as `def func_1(n, m):` and called with the appropriate arguments. Despite this, the current implementation works correctly because it reads `n` and `m` inside the function, which is a common practice in competitive programming to handle multiple test cases.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program is correct in terms of its functionality and output.

Correctness: **True**
