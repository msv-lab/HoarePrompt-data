The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Yes'. The precondition states that `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, with the constraints 1 <= n, m <= 100, and the difference `n - m` is a non-negative even number. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `m` or any other variables. It simply prints the string 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
