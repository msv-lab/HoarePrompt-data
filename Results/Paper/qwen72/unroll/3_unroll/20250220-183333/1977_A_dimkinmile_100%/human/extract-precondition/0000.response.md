Precondition: **The function should actually be defined with parameters `n` and `m` as described in the problem, so the correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, m):` where `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.**

However, based on the provided function definition `def func_1():`, it seems there is a mismatch. The function should be defined with parameters to match the problem description. Here is the corrected precondition assuming the function definition is updated:

Precondition: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.**
