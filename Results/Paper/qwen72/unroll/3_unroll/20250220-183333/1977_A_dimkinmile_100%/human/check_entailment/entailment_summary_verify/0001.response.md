### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

3. **Logic for Determining Possibility**:
   - The program checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even and non-negative.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Explanation of the Logic**:
   - **Even Difference**: The difference `(n - m)` being even is crucial because each move can either add or remove one cube. If the difference is even, it means that the number of "add" moves and "remove" moves can be balanced to achieve the desired number of cubes `m` after `n` moves.
   - **Non-negative Difference**: The difference `(n - m)` being non-negative ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the desired number of cubes `m`, which is necessary to build a tower of height `m`.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - For the test case `3 3`, `n - m = 0` which is even and non-negative. Hence, the answer is "Yes".
   - For the test case `2 4`, `n - m = -2` which is not non-negative. Hence, the answer is "No".
   - For the test case `5 3`, `n - m = 2` which is even and non-negative. Hence, the answer is "Yes".

### Function Summary Verification:
- The function summary states that `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from user input, checks if `(n - m)` is a non-negative even number, and prints "Yes" if the condition is met, otherwise "No". This aligns with the actual implementation of `func_1`.

### Original Assessment Verification:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and conditions used in the program.
- The conditions `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` are indeed necessary and sufficient to determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The test cases provided in the assessment are correctly evaluated based on the program's logic.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct as it accurately implements the logic to determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, and the conditions checked are valid and align with the problem description.

Final: **True**
