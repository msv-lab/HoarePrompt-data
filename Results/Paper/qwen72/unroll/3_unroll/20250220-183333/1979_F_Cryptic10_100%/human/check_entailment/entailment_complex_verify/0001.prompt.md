You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

Kostyanych has chosen a complete undirected graph^{\dagger} with n vertices,
and then removed exactly (n - 2) edges from it. You can ask queries of the
following type:

  * "? d " — Kostyanych tells you the number of vertex v with a degree at least d . Among all possible such vertices, he selects the vertex with the minimum degree, and if there are several such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. He also tells you the number of another vertex in the graph, with which v is not connected by an edge (if none is found, then 0 is reported). Among all possible such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. Then he removes the vertex v and all edges coming out of it. If the required vertex v is not found, then "0\ 0 " is reported. 

Find a Hamiltonian path^{\ddagger} in the original graph in at most n queries.
It can be proven that under these constraints, a Hamiltonian path always
exists.

^{\dagger} A complete undirected graph is a graph in which there is exactly
one undirected edge between any pair of distinct vertices. Thus, a complete
undirected graph with n vertices contains \frac{n(n-1)}{2} edges.

^{\ddagger} A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path that passes through each
vertex exactly once.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Interaction

Interaction for each test case begins with reading the integer n .

Then you can make no more than n queries.

To make a query, output a line in the format "? d " (without quotes) (0 \le d
\le n - 1 ). After each query, read two integers — the answer to your query.

When you are ready to report the answer, output a line in the format "! v_1\
v_2 \ldots v_n " (without quotes) — the vertices in the order of their
occurrence in the Hamiltonian path. Outputting the answer does not count as
one of the n queries. After solving one test case, the program should
immediately move on to the next one. After solving all test cases, the program
should be terminated immediately.

If your program makes more than n queries for one test case or makes an
incorrect query, then the response to the query will be -1 , and after
receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to
receive the verdict Wrong answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.

After outputting a query, do not forget to output an end of line and flush the
output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Idleness limit
exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see documentation for other languages. 

The interactor is non-adaptive. The graph does not change during the
interaction.

Hacks

To hack, use the following format:

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

Each of the following (n - 2) lines should contains two integers u and v (1
\le u, v \le n , u \ne v ) — ends of the edge that was removed from the graph.
Each edge must not occur more than once.

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^5 .

Note

In the first test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75d8c5328ccca8f82b69ba8300140bed4d40ce80.png)

Consider the queries:

  * There are no vertices with a degree of at least 3 in the graph, so "0\ 0 " is reported.
  * There are four vertices with a degree of at least 2 , and all of them have a degree of exactly 2 : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Vertex 1 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 4 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 1 . After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * There are three vertices with a degree of at least 1 , among them vertices 2 and 3 have a minimum degree of 1 (vertex 4 has a degree of 2 ). Vertex 2 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 3 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 2 . After this, vertex 2 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the second test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/44d26c229eaff752c0a00c7160792daef41c7502.png)

Consider the queries:

  * Vertex 1 has a degree of at least 3 , but it is connected to all vertices, so "1\ 0 " is reported. After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * The remaining vertices 2 , 3 , and 4 have a degree of at least 0 , but among them vertex 4 has the minimum degree of 0 (vertices 2 and 3 have a degree of 1 ). Vertex 4 is not connected to both vertices 2 and 3 , so vertex 2 is reported (as it has the minimum number). After this, vertex 4 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the third test case, the graph consists of 2 vertices connected by an edge.

The graph is initially a complete undirected graph with n vertices, from which exactly (n - 2) edges have been removed. The function can make up to n queries of the form "? d" where d is an integer such that 0 <= d <= n - 1. The function must output a Hamiltonian path in the form "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n" where v_i are the vertices in the order of their occurrence in the path. The function must handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases t satisfying 1 <= t <= 1000, and the number of vertices n in each test case satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^5.

    #State: The loop has processed all test cases. For each test case, it has printed the final sequence of vertices in the format "! vertex1 vertex2 ...", where the vertices are ordered such that any vertex v1 that has a direct edge to v2 (as determined by the queries) appears before v2 in the sequence. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the function `q` continues to perform the same operations as initially defined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` operates in an interactive environment to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices, from which exactly `(n - 2)` edges have been removed. The function makes up to `n` queries to determine the structure of the graph, and then outputs a Hamiltonian path for the graph in the format "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n", where `v_i` are the vertices in the order of their occurrence in the path. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the Hamiltonian paths for each graph, and the variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The function `q` continues to perform the same operations as initially defined.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, from which \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed.
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query of the form "? d" returns a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and a vertex \( u \) that is not connected to \( v \). If no such vertex \( v \) exists, the response is "0 0".

2. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - The algorithm uses a set \( vx \) to keep track of the remaining vertices.
   - It repeatedly queries the graph to find and remove vertices with the minimum degree that is at least \( d \), where \( d \) is adjusted based on the number of remaining vertices.
   - The algorithm constructs the Hamiltonian path by appending the removed vertices to the appropriate end of the path.

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - \( vx \) is initialized with all vertices from 1 to \( n \).
     - \( ops \) is an empty list to store the operations (vertices and their non-adjacent vertices).

   - **Query Loop:**
     - While there are more than 2 vertices left in \( vx \):
       - Query the graph with \( d = \text{len}(vx) - 2 \).
       - If the response is "0 0", it means no vertex with the required degree exists. In this case, the algorithm makes another query with \( d = 0 \) to find a vertex with the minimum degree.
       - Remove the vertex \( v1 \) from \( vx \).
       - If \( v2 \) is greater than 0, it means \( v1 \) is not connected to \( v2 \), and the pair \( (v1, v2) \) is added to \( ops \).
       - If \( v2 \) is 0, it means \( v1 \) is connected to all remaining vertices. In this case, another query with \( d = 0 \) is made to find a vertex \( v3 \) with the minimum degree, and the pairs \( (v3, 0) \) and \( (v1, 0) \) are added to \( ops \).

   - **Constructing the Path:**
     - After the loop, \( vx \) contains at most 2 vertices.
     - The algorithm constructs the Hamiltonian path by appending the removed vertices to the appropriate end of the path.
     - The final path is printed in the required format.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm handles the case where the graph is reduced to 2 vertices correctly by simply appending them to the path.
   - The algorithm also handles the case where a vertex is connected to all remaining vertices by making an additional query with \( d = 0 \).

5. **Query Limit:**
   - The algorithm ensures that it makes at most \( n \) queries by removing one vertex per query and handling the special case of "0 0" responses efficiently.

### Correctness:
Given the detailed reasoning and the algorithm's ability to handle all edge cases and constraints, the provided program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
