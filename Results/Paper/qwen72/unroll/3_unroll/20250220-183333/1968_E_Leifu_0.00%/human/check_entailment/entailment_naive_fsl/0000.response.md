Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases for maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. Specifically, the program fails for \(n > 3\). 

For example, when \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
```
However, this arrangement does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). The set of Manhattan distances for this arrangement is \(\{1, 2, 3, 6\}\), which has a size of 4. A better arrangement that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\) is:
```
1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4
```
This arrangement results in the set of Manhattan distances \(\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 5, which is the maximum possible for \(n = 4\).

Similarly, for \(n = 5\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
5 5
```
This arrangement does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). A better arrangement that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 5\) is:
```
1 1
1 3
1 4
2 1
5 5
```
This arrangement results in the set of Manhattan distances \(\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which has a size of 7, which is the maximum possible for \(n = 5\).

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is incorrect.
