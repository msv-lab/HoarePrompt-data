### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an integer \( n \) and need to choose \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid.
   - The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen cells.
   - The Manhattan distance between cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
   - It then prints the cells \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) for every test case.
   - If \( n = 3 \), it prints the cell \((2, 3)\).
   - If \( n > 3 \), it prints the cell \((2, 4)\) and then prints cells \((j, j)\) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Program:**
   - **For \( n = 2 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the distances: \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \).
     - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 1, which is the maximum possible for \( n = 2 \).

   - **For \( n = 3 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the distances:
       - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
       - \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
       - \( |1-2| + |1-3| = 3 \)
       - \( |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 \)
     - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4, which is the maximum possible for \( n = 3 \).

   - **For \( n > 3 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((j, j)\) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \).
     - Let's consider \( n = 4 \):
       - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\).
       - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the distances:
         - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
         - \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
         - \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 5 \)
         - \( |1-4| + |1-4| = 6 \)
         - \( |1-1| + |2-4| = 3 \)
         - \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 4 \)
         - \( |1-4| + |2-4| = 5 \)
         - \( |2-2| + |4-4| = 0 \)
         - \( |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 \)
       - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 5, which is not the maximum possible for \( n = 4 \). The maximum possible size is 6, as shown in the problem notes.

     - Let's consider \( n = 5 \):
       - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\).
       - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the distances:
         - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
         - \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
         - \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 5 \)
         - \( |1-4| + |1-4| = 6 \)
         - \( |1-1| + |2-4| = 3 \)
         - \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 4 \)
         - \( |1-4| + |2-4| = 5 \)
         - \( |2-2| + |4-4| = 0 \)
         - \( |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 \)
         - \( |1-5| + |1-5| = 8 \)
         - \( |1-5| + |2-5| = 7 \)
         - \( |1-5| + |4-5| = 5 \)
         - \( |2-5| + |4-5| = 4 \)
         - \( |2-5| + |5-5| = 3 \)
         - \( |4-5| + |5-5| = 1 \)
       - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 7, which is not the maximum possible for \( n = 5 \). The maximum possible size is 9, as shown in the problem notes.

     - Let's consider \( n = 6 \):
       - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\).
       - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the distances:
         - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
         - \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
         - \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 5 \)
         - \( |1-4| + |1-4| = 6 \)
         - \( |1-1| + |2-4| = 3 \)
         - \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 4 \)
         - \( |1-4| + |2-4| = 5 \)
         - \( |2-2| + |4-4| = 0 \)
         - \( |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 \)
         - \( |1-5| + |1-5| = 8 \)
         - \( |1-5| + |2-5| = 7 \)
         - \( |1-5| + |4-5| = 5 \)
         - \( |2-5| + |4-5| = 4 \)
         - \( |2-5| + |5-5| = 3 \)
         - \( |4-5| + |5-5| = 1 \)
         - \( |1-6| + |1-6| = 10 \)
         - \( |1-6| + |2-6| = 9 \)
         - \( |1-6| + |4-6| = 7 \)
         - \( |2-6| + |4-6| = 6 \)
         - \( |2-6| + |5-6| = 5 \)
         - \( |4-6| + |5-6| = 3 \)
         - \( |4-6| + |6-6| = 2 \)
         - \( |5-6| + |6-6| = 1 \)
       - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 9, which is not the maximum possible for \( n = 6 \). The maximum possible size is 11, as shown in the problem notes.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not always produce the correct output for \( n > 3 \). Specifically, it does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \( n = 4 \), \( n = 5 \), and \( n = 6 \).
