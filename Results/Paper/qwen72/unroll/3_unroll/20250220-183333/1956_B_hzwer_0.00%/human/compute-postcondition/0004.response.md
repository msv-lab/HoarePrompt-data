Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) initialized with zeros, `dp[n - 1][0]` is 0, `dp[n - 2][0]` is 0.**

The value of `dp[n - 2][0]` has been set to 0, and all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
