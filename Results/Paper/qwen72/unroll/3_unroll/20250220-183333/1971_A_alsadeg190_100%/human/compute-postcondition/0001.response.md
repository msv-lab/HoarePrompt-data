The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so we do not need to adjust it. The state of `y` and `t` are not relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
