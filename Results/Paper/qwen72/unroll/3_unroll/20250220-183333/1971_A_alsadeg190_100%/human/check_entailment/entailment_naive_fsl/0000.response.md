Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles the problem description for all potential cases. It reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. It then prints the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. The logic is straightforward and works for all possible inputs within the given constraints (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100). There are no edge cases or missing logic that would cause the program to fail.
