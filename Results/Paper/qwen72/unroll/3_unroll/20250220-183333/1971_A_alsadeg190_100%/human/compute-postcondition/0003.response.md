Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is intended to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100. For each iteration, the function expects to receive two integers `x` and `y` (both between 0 and 9) as space-separated inputs. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each iteration.**
