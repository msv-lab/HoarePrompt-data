Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, each time reading an integer `n` as specified in the problem description.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1. According to the problem, if `n` is 1, there is no string that can have exactly one special character, so it prints 'NO'.

3. **String Construction**:
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string by repeating each character from `s` (the uppercase alphabet) twice, `n // 2` times. This ensures that each character is equal to one of its neighbors, and the total number of special characters is `n`.
   - For odd `n`, the program starts with 'AAA' to ensure the first three characters are special, and then continues the pattern of repeating each character twice for the remaining `n // 2 - 1` characters. This also ensures that the total number of special characters is `n`.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string for valid `n` values, and 'NO' for `n = 1`.

5. **String Length**: The problem guarantees that if a solution exists, it can be constructed with a length of at most 200. The program constructs strings of length at most `n + 1` for odd `n` and `n` for even `n`, which is well within the limit of 200.

6. **Variable `s`**: The variable `s` is correctly used to provide the uppercase Latin letters needed for the string construction. It remains unchanged throughout the program, which is appropriate.

7. **Variable `t`**: The variable `t` is used to control the number of test cases, and the loop correctly iterates `t` times.

8. **Variable `x`**: The variable `x` is used to index into the string `s` to ensure different characters are used for the string construction, which is a valid approach.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
