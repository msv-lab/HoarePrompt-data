The function `func` should accept an integer `n` as input, where `1 <= n <= 50`. Based on the value of `n`, the function returns a string or a specific message. However, the specific conditions and outputs for different values of `n` are not provided in the problem description. Assuming the function returns a string based on `n` and handles invalid input, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` where `1 <= n <= 50` and returns a string based on the value of `n`. If `n` is outside the valid range, it returns a specific error message.**
