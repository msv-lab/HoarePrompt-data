### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by clearing the console using `os.system('cls')`. This is not necessary for the correctness of the algorithm but does not affect the logic.
   - It then reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because a single character cannot have both a left and a right neighbor.

3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is not 1, the program constructs a string `ans`:
     - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by adding pairs of the same character from the uppercase alphabet. This ensures that each character in the string is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
     - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' (which has 3 special characters) and then adds pairs of the same character from the uppercase alphabet. This ensures that the string has an odd number of special characters.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Even `n`**:
  - For even `n`, the program correctly constructs a string of length `n` where each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, if `n = 6`, the string 'AAABBB' is valid because each 'A' and 'B' is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- **Odd `n`**:
  - For odd `n`, the program starts with 'AAA' and then adds pairs of the same character. This ensures that the string has an odd number of special characters. For example, if `n = 5`, the string 'AAABB' is valid because the first three 'A's and the last two 'B's are special characters.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n == 1` by printing 'NO'.
  - The program ensures that the length of the string is at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and edge cases. It constructs a valid string for even `n` and odd `n` greater than 1, and correctly reports 'NO' for `n == 1`.

### Correctness:
**True**
