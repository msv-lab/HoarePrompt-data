Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1. Since a string with exactly one special character cannot exist (a special character must have at least one neighbor), the program prints 'NO' for this case, which is correct.

3. **String Construction**:
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string by repeating each of the first `n // 2` uppercase letters twice. This ensures that each repeated letter is a special character because it is equal to its neighbor. For example, for `n = 6`, the string 'AABBCC' is constructed, which has 6 special characters (A, A, B, B, C, C).
   - For odd `n`, the program starts with 'AAA' and then repeats each of the next `n // 2 - 1` uppercase letters twice. This ensures that the first three characters are special (A, A, A), and the subsequent repeated letters are also special. For example, for `n = 5`, the string 'AAABBC' is constructed, which has 5 special characters (A, A, A, B, B).

4. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string for valid `n` values, and 'NO' for `n = 1`. The constructed strings are of length at most 200, which meets the problem's requirement.

5. **Console Clearing**: The `os.system('cls')` command is used to clear the console screen. This is not strictly necessary for the correctness of the algorithm but does not affect the program's output.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
