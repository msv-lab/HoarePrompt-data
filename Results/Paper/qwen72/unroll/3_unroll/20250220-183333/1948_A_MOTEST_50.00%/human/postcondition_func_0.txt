The function `func` does not return any value but performs the following actions: It first clears the console screen. It then reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` from the user. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans`. The string `ans` is constructed as follows: if `n` is even, it consists of the first `n // 2` uppercase letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice (e.g., 'AABBCC' for `n = 6`). If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then continues with the first `n // 2 - 1` uppercase letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice (e.g., 'AAABBC' for `n = 5`). The function does not modify any external state beyond printing to the console.
