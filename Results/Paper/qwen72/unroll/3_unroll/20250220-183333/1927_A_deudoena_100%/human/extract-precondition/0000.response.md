Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples test_cases, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 10) and a string s of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B'. Each string s is guaranteed to have at least one 'B'.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to include the parameters as described. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

With the precondition:

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 \le t \le 10^4), and test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 10) and a string s of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B'. Each string s is guaranteed to have at least one 'B'.**
