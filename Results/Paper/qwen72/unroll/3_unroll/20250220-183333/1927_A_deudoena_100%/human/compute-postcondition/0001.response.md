Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples test_cases, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B'. Each string s is guaranteed to have at least one 'B'. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer.**
