You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples test_cases, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 10) and a string s of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B'. Each string s is guaranteed to have at least one 'B'.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `m` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer between 1 and 10 and a string of that length consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' with at least one 'B', `l` is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is the distance from the end of `s` to the last 'B' in `s` plus 1, `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in `s`, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `m` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer between 1 and 10 and a string of that length consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' with at least one 'B', `l` is an empty list.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' in `s` (`ma`) and the position of the first 'B' in `s` (`mi`), plus 2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B'. The function returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B' in `s`, plus 2, for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' in `s` (`ma`) and the position of the first 'B' in `s` (`mi`), plus 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
