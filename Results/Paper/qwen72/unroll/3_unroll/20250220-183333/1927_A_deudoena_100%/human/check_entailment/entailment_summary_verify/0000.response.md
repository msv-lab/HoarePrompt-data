### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function `func_1` to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads an integer `m` (length of the strip) and a string `s` (the strip itself).
   - It initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the string `s` to find the position of the first 'B' and sets `mi` to that position.
   - It iterates through the string `s` in reverse to find the position of the last 'B' and sets `ma` to that position.
   - Finally, it returns `ma - mi + 2`.

### Analysis:

1. **Handling the Entire Strip Already White:**
   - The problem guarantees that at least one cell is black, so the case where the entire strip is white should not occur.
   - However, the function does not handle this case explicitly. If the strip were "WWWW", the function would return `ma - mi + 2`, which is undefined because `mi` and `ma` would both be 0. This is a theoretical issue, but since the problem guarantees at least one black cell, it is not a practical issue.

2. **Handling Black Cells at the Beginning or End:**
   - If the input string is "BWWWW", the function will set `mi` to 1 (the position of the first 'B') and `ma` to 1 (the position of the last 'B' in reverse).
   - The function will return `1 - 1 + 2 = 2`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 1, as only the first cell needs to be painted white.

3. **Handling No Black Cells Between the First and Last Black Cells:**
   - If the input string is "BWWWWB", the function will set `mi` to 1 (the position of the first 'B') and `ma` to 6 (the position of the last 'B' in reverse).
   - The function will return `6 - 1 + 2 = 7`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 6, as the entire strip needs to be painted white to cover all black cells.

### Correctness Issues:

- **Incorrect Calculation for Single Black Cell at the Beginning or End:**
  - The function incorrectly adds 2 to the difference between `ma` and `mi`. This is a mistake because the length of the segment to be painted should be `ma - mi + 1` (inclusive of both positions).

- **Incorrect Calculation for Multiple Black Cells:**
  - The function incorrectly adds 2 to the difference between `ma` and `mi`. This is a mistake because the length of the segment to be painted should be `ma - mi + 1` (inclusive of both positions).

### Corrected Function:

To correct the function, we need to adjust the calculation to `ma - mi + 1` and handle the case where the entire strip is already white (though this case is not possible according to the problem constraints).

```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d + 1
            break
    return ma - mi + 1
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the cases where the black cells are at the beginning or end of the strip and does not correctly calculate the length of the segment to be painted. The function should return `ma - mi + 1` instead of `ma - mi + 2`.

Final: **False**
