### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to construct a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - The permutation should contain all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once.
   - `k` is guaranteed to be even.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then constructs the permutation `answer` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements in `array`.
   - The variable `a` is a list containing two indices: `a[0]` starts at 1 and `a[1]` starts at -1 (which is used to index from the end of the array).

3. **Step-by-Step Execution**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `array` with the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - The permutation `answer` is initialized with the first element `[1]`.
   - The program then iterates from 1 to `n-1` to fill the rest of the permutation:
     - If `(-1) ** i == -1` (i.e., `i` is odd), it appends the element at the end of `array` (using `a[1]` and decrementing `a[1]`).
     - If `(-1) ** i == 1` (i.e., `i` is even), it appends the element at the start of `array` (using `a[0]` and incrementing `a[0]`).

4. **Validation of the Approach**:
   - The approach ensures that the permutation is constructed by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
   - This alternating pattern helps in balancing the sums of the continuous segments of length `k`.
   - Since `k` is even, the sums of the segments will be balanced because the permutation alternates between the smallest and largest elements, which helps in keeping the sums close to each other.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is small (e.g., `n = 2` and `k = 2`).
   - The program also handles larger values of `n` and `k` within the given constraints.

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the permutation for each test case.
   - The permutation is constructed such that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, which satisfies the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for the given problem description. The approach of alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements ensures that the sums of the continuous segments of length `k` are balanced.

**Correctness: True**
