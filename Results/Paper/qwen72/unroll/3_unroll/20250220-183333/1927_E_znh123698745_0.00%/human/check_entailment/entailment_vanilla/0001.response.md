### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes an array `array` with the integers from 1 to `n` using `list(range(1, n + 1))`.
   - It then initializes an `answer` list with the first element being 1.
   - The list `a` is initialized with `[1, -1]`, which will be used to keep track of the indices to pick from the `array`.

3. **Alternating Pattern**:
   - The program uses a loop to construct the permutation. For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`:
     - If `(-1) ** i` is -1, it appends the element at the index `a[-1]` (which is initially -1) from the `array` to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
     - If `(-1) ** i` is 1, it appends the element at the index `a[0]` (which is initially 1) from the `array` to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The key idea is to alternate between the smallest and largest available elements in the `array` to ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
- By starting with 1 and alternating between the smallest and largest elements, the program ensures that the sums of the segments are balanced.
- The condition `(-1) ** i` effectively alternates between appending the smallest and largest elements, which helps in maintaining the required property of the k-level permutation.

### Verification:
- Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:
  - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`:
    - The permutation is `[2, 1]`.
    - The sum of the segment of length 2 is `2 + 1 = 3`.
    - There is only one segment, so the condition is trivially satisfied.
  - For `n = 3` and `k = 2`:
    - The permutation is `[1, 3, 2]`.
    - The sums of the segments are `1 + 3 = 4` and `3 + 2 = 5`.
    - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is `5 - 4 = 1`, which satisfies the condition.
  - For `n = 10` and `k = 4`:
    - The permutation is `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`.
    - The sums of the segments are:
      - `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`
      - `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`
      - `4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23`
      - `10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24`
      - `2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23`
      - `7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24`
      - `5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23`
    - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is `24 - 23 = 1`, which satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a k-level permutation for the given constraints and examples. The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
