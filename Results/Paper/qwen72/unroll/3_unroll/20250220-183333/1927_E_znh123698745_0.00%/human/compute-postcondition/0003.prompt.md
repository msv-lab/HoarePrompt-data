You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        answer = [1]
        
        a = [1, -1]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        
        print(*answer)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, the output is a sequence of integers from 1 to n, arranged in a specific pattern where the first element is 1, followed by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the original array. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` retain their initial values as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple parameters, including an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `k` such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is even. The exact return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
