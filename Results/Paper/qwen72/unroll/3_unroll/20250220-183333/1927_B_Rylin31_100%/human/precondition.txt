t is a positive integer (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5) and a list a of n integers (0 \le a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and it is guaranteed that for each trace, there exists a suitable string s.
