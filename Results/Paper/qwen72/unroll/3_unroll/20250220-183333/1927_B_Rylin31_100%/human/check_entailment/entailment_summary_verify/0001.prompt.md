You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        s = [0 for i in range(l)]
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = ''
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing a trace. For each test case, the function constructs a string by mapping each integer in the trace to a character based on its position in the alphabet (starting from 'a'). The function then prints the constructed string for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes and no further output is generated.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `l` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes an array `s` of length `l` with all elements set to 0. This array will keep track of the count of each character used so far.

3. **String Construction:**
   - For each element `j` in the trace array `array`, it constructs the corresponding character by using `chr(s[j] + 97)`. The value `s[j]` represents the count of the character that has been used `j` times before the current position.
   - It then increments the count `s[j]` by 1 to reflect the use of the character at the current position.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the string `ans` for the current test case, it prints the string.

### Analysis:
- **Character Mapping:**
  - The expression `chr(s[j] + 97)` correctly maps the count `s[j]` to a lowercase Latin letter. Since `s[j]` starts at 0 and increments by 1, it will map to 'a', 'b', 'c', etc.
  - For example, if `s[j]` is 0, `chr(0 + 97)` is 'a'. If `s[j]` is 1, `chr(1 + 97)` is 'b', and so on.

- **Trace Array Handling:**
  - The trace array `array` contains the number of previous occurrences of the character at each position.
  - The program correctly uses this information to determine the character at each position by looking up the count in `s` and converting it to the corresponding letter.

- **Test Case Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each test case independently.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `11`, `0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4`
  - Output: `abracadabra`
  - Reason: The trace array indicates that the first three characters are unique ('a', 'b', 'r'), the fourth character has one previous occurrence ('a'), the fifth character is unique ('c'), the sixth character has two previous occurrences ('a'), and so on. The program correctly constructs the string `abracadabra`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `10`, `0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0`
  - Output: `codeforces`
  - Reason: The trace array indicates that the first five characters are unique ('c', 'o', 'd', 'e', 'f'), the sixth character has one previous occurrence ('o'), the seventh character is unique ('r'), the eighth character has one previous occurrence ('c'), and so on. The program correctly constructs the string `codeforces`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1`, `0`
  - Output: `a`
  - Reason: The trace array indicates that the only character is unique, so the program correctly outputs `a`.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `8`, `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7`
  - Output: `abcdefgh`
  - Reason: The trace array indicates that each character is unique and appears in increasing order, so the program correctly outputs `abcdefgh`.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `8`, `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
  - Output: `aaaaaaaa`
  - Reason: The trace array indicates that each character is unique and appears only once, so the program correctly outputs `aaaaaaaa`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem description and produces the expected output for the given examples. It correctly maps the trace array to a string of lowercase Latin letters and processes multiple test cases as required.
