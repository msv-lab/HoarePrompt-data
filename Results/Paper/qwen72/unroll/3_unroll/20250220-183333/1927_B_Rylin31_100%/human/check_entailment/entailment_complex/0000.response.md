### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `l` and the trace array `array`.

2. **String Construction**:
   - The function initializes an array `s` of length `l` with all elements set to 0. This array will keep track of the number of times each character has been used.
   - It then iterates over each element `j` in the trace array `array`.
   - For each `j`, it appends the character corresponding to the current value of `s[j]` (converted to a character using `chr(s[j] + 97)`) to the result string `ans`.
   - It increments `s[j]` by 1 to reflect that the character has been used one more time.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly by printing a single character 'a'.
   - The function also handles the case where all elements in the trace array are 0 correctly by printing a string of 'a's of length `n`.

5. **Correctness of Trace Mapping**:
   - The trace array `array` is correctly interpreted. Each `a_i` in the trace array represents the number of times the character at position `i` has appeared before in the string.
   - The function correctly maps each `a_i` to a character based on the current count of that character in the `s` array.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly reconstructs a string from the given trace array for each test case. It follows the problem description and handles all edge cases as expected.

### Correctness:
**True**
