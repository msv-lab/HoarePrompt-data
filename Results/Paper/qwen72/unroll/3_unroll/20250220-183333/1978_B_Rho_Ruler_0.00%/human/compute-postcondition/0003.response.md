Output State: **The program returns True.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is calculated as `(k * b) + ((n - k) * a)`. Given that `0 <= k <= min(n, b)`, the maximum value of `ans` will be when `k` is either `0` or `min(n, b)`. When `k = 0`, `ans` is `n * a`, and when `k = min(n, b)`, `ans` is `n * b` if `b` is the maximum of `a` and `b`, or `n * a` if `a` is the maximum. In both cases, `ans` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, so the program returns `True`.
