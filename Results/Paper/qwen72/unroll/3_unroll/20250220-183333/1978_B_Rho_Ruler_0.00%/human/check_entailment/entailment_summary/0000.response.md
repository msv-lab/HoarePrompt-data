Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is not designed to correctly determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling the buns. Instead, it checks if the sum of the modified and usual prices of the buns is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements. The binary search loop in the main part of the program is also misused, as it does not correctly identify the optimal `k` value that maximizes the profit.

The correct approach to solve this problem involves calculating the profit for different values of `k` and selecting the one that gives the maximum profit. The profit for a given `k` can be calculated as the sum of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price plus the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k)) + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This version iterates over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)` and calculates the profit for each value. It then prints the maximum profit found.

Correctness: **False**
