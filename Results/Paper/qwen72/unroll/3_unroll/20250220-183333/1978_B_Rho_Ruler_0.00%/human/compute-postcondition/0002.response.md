Output State: **k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), a and b are positive integers, and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9, ans is (k * b) + ((n - k) * a).**

The value of `ans` is updated to be the sum of its previous value `k * b` and the expression `(n - k) * a`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
