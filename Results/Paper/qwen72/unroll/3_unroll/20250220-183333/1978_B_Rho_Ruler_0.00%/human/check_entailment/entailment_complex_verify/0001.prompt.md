You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), a and b are positive integers, and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)
    #The program returns True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. It calculates a value `ans` which is the sum of `k * b` and `(n - k) * a`. The function returns `True` if `ans` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. Given the constraints on the input parameters, the function will always return `True`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Bob bakes `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - Bob can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

2. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - The program uses a binary search to find the optimal `k`.
   - The binary search is performed on the range `[0, n]`.
   - The function `func_1` is used to determine if a given `k` is valid.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` calculates the total profit for a given `k`.
   - It adds the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price: `k * b`.
   - It adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price: `(n - k) * a`.
   - The function returns `True` if the total profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`.

4. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search iterates while `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - It calculates `mid` as the midpoint of `low` and `high`.
   - If `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` returns `True`, it means the profit for `mid` is valid, and `mid` is stored in `ans`. The search continues by setting `low` to `mid + 1` to explore higher values of `k`.
   - If `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` returns `False`, it means the profit for `mid` is not valid, and the search continues by setting `high` to `mid - 1` to explore lower values of `k`.

5. **Output**:
   - After the binary search, the program prints the value of `ans`.

6. **Issues with the Program**:
   - The function `func_1` is incorrect. It should calculate the total profit correctly, but the current implementation does not account for the modified price of the first `k` buns correctly.
   - The modified price of the first `k` buns should be the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b - 1) + (b - 2) + ... + (b - k + 1)`.
   - The current implementation incorrectly adds `k * b` instead of the sum of the arithmetic series.

7. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation of `func_1` should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(k, a, b, n):
         if k == 0:
             return n * a
         modified_profit = (b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2  # Sum of the first k modified prices
         usual_profit = (n - k) * a
         total_profit = modified_profit + usual_profit
         return total_profit
     ```

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The current program does not correctly calculate the profit for the first `k` buns.
   - The binary search logic is also flawed because it does not correctly determine the maximum profit.
