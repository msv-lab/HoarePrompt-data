#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept three parameters: `t` (an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` (integers where 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), and `a` (a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'). The function should be called multiple times, each for a different test case, and should return the minimum number of problems needed to be created for each test case.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and always returns 0. It does not modify any external state or variables.
