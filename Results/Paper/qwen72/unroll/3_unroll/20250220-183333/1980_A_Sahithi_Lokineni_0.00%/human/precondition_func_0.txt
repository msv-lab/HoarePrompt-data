The function should accept three parameters: `t` (an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` (integers where 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), and `a` (a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'). The function should be called multiple times, each for a different test case, and should return the minimum number of problems needed to be created for each test case.
