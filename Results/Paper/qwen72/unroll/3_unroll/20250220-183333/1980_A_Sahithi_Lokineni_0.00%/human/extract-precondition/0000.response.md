Precondition: **The function should accept three parameters: `t` (an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000), `n` and `m` (integers where 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), and `a` (a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'). The function should be called multiple times, each for a different test case, and should return the minimum number of problems needed to be created for each test case.**

However, the function definition provided is incomplete. It should be updated to reflect the parameters described in the problem. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, n, m, a):
```

With the updated function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
