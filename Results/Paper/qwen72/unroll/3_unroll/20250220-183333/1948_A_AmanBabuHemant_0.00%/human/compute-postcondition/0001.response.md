The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The original state indicates that `t` should be a list of integers, but in the loop head, `t` is being used as an integer. Therefore, `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is an integer and meets the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0**
