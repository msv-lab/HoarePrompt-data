Output State: **The function should be called with a single argument, which is a list of integers `t`, where each integer in the list satisfies 1 <= t[i] <= 50, and the length of the list is also within the range 1 <= len(t) <= 50. Each integer `n` in the list `t` represents a test case and must satisfy 1 <= n <= 50. The variable `t` is now an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` changes the variable `t` from a list of integers to a single integer input by the user. The precondition about the list `t` and its elements is no longer valid, but the requirement that the function should be called with a single argument is still valid. The new value of `t` is an input integer.
