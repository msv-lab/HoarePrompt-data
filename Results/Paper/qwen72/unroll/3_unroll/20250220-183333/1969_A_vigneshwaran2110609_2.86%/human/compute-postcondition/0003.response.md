The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `p`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all `p_i` are distinct. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `p`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each between 1 and `n` and not equal to its index. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the exact return value is not specified.**
