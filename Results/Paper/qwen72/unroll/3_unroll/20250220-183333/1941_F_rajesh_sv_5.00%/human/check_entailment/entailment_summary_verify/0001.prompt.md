You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It calls `func_3` to determine the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it calls `func_6`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `testcases` holds the result of `func_3` execution, and no other variables are affected.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program defines several functions to handle input efficiently:
     - `func_2()` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
     - `func_3()` converts the result of `func_2()` to an integer.
     - `func_4()` splits the input line by a delimiter (default is a space) and converts each element to an integer.
     - `func_5()` reads a line from standard input (used for reading strings, but not used in this program).

2. **Main Function (`func_6`):**
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of problems `n`, models `m`, and functions `k`.
   - It reads the complexities of the prepared problems `A`.
   - It reads the complexities of the models `D` and sorts them after removing duplicates.
   - It reads the complexities of the functions `F`.
   - It initializes `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` to find the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`.
   - It iterates through the array `A` to find the maximum difference and its index.
   - It then calculates the minimum imbalance by considering the insertion of a new problem with complexity `d_i + f_j` for each function `f` in `F`.
   - It uses binary search (`bisect_right` and `bisect_left`) to find the appropriate model `d_i` that minimizes the imbalance.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum imbalance.

3. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The program uses binary search to find the optimal model `d_i` for each function `f` to minimize the imbalance.
   - It calculates the potential new complexities `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` and checks which one provides a better balance.
   - It updates the minimum imbalance accordingly.

4. **Output Handling:**
   - The program prints the maximum of the minimum imbalance and the next maximum difference to ensure that the imbalance is correctly calculated even if no new problem is added.

5. **Overall Structure:**
   - The program is structured to handle multiple test cases efficiently.
   - It uses a combination of input handling, sorting, and binary search to find the optimal solution.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the largest difference between consecutive elements in the array `A`.
- It then uses binary search to find the optimal model `d_i` for each function `f` to minimize the imbalance.
- The logic for updating the minimum imbalance is correct.
- The program handles multiple test cases and ensures that the sum of complexities does not exceed the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.
