Output State: **`testcases` is the result of `func_3()` execution, and no other variables are affected.**

Explanation: The loop iterates `testcases` times, and within each iteration, it calls `func_6()`. Since `func_6()` does not modify `testcases` or any other variables, the value of `testcases` remains unchanged after the loop completes. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
