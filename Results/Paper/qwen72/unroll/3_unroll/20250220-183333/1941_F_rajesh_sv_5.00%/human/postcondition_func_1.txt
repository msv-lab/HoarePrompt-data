The function `wrapper` does not accept any parameters. It checks if the tuple `args` is a key in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is not a key in `d`, it adds `args` as a key and sets its value to the result of `func(*args)`. If `args` is already a key in `d`, the state of `d` remains unchanged. The function returns the value associated with the key `args` in the dictionary `d`.
