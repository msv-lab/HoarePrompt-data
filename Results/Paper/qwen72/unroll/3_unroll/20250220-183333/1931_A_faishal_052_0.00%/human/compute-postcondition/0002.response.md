To determine the output state of the given loop, let's break down the code and understand how it processes the input and generates the output.

### Initial State:
- The function accepts an integer `n` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters.
- `cases` is an input integer that determines how many times the loop will run.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop**:
   - The loop runs `cases` times.
   - Inside the loop, `arr` is initialized as an empty list for each iteration.

2. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop runs 2 times.
   - For each iteration, it checks the value of `lex`:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.

3. **After Inner Loop**:
   - The remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is sorted in ascending order.

4. **Output**:
   - The sorted values in `arr` are converted to their corresponding lowercase Latin letters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)` and printed without spaces.

### Example Execution:
Let's assume `cases = 1` and `lex = 55` for simplicity.

1. **First Iteration**:
   - `arr = []`
   - `lex = 55`
   - Inner Loop:
     - First iteration: `lex > 26`, so `arr.append(26)`, `lex = 29`
     - Second iteration: `lex > 26`, so `arr.append(26)`, `lex = 3`
   - After inner loop: `arr.append(3)`, so `arr = [26, 26, 3]`
   - Sorting `arr`: `arr = [3, 26, 26]`
   - Output: `chr(3 + 96) + chr(26 + 96) + chr(26 + 96) = 'c' + 'z' + 'z' = 'czz'`

### General Output State:
- The loop will run `cases` times.
- For each case, it will process the value of `lex` and produce a string of three lowercase Latin letters.
- The letters are determined by the sorted values in `arr` after the inner loop and the final value of `lex`.

### Final Output State:
- The output state will be a sequence of strings, each containing three lowercase Latin letters, corresponding to the processed values of `lex` for each case.

Output State: **For each of the `cases` iterations, the output will be a string of three lowercase Latin letters, where the letters are determined by the sorted values in `arr` after processing `lex`.**
