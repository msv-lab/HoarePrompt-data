Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the lexicographically smallest word correctly in all potential cases. For example, when the input is 55, the correct output should be "czz", but the program outputs "azz". This is because the program incorrectly assigns the first two characters as 26 (z) when it should assign the first character as 3 (c) and the remaining characters as 26 (z) to achieve the lexicographically smallest word.
