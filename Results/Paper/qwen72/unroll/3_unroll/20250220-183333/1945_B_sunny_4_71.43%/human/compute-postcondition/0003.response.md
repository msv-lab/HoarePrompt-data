The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function should accept multiple parameters. Specifically, it should accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should accept three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` where 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but typically, such a function would return results for each test case based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). The function returns results for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
