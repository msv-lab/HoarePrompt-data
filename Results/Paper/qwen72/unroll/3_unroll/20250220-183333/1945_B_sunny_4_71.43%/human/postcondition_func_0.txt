The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input. It then calculates and prints the sum of two values: \(A = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + 1\) and \(B = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged.
