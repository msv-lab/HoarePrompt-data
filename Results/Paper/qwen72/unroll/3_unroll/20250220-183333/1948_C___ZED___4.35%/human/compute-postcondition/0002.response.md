The function `func` accepts three parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) where each integer represents the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples `(row1, row2)` where each tuple contains two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. Additionally, `n` is even, there are no arrows pointing outside the grid, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to a test case and represents the minimum number of moves required to make the arrows in the grid point in the same direction.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, a list of integers `n`, and a list of tuples `(row1, row2)`. It returns a list of integers where each integer is the minimum number of moves required to align the arrows in the grid for each test case.**
