#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) where each integer represents the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples (row1, row2) where each tuple contains two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. Additionally, n is even, there are no arrows pointing outside the grid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reading the number of columns `n` and the two rows of arrows `a` and `b`. For each test case, it checks if the second-to-last arrow in `b` is not '>', and if so, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a path from the left to the right by ensuring that every second arrow in `b` (starting from index 0) is '>', and if not, it checks if every second arrow in `a` (starting from index 1) is '>'. If no such path exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After all iterations, the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path` will have their final values based on the last test case processed, and the loop will have completed its execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n` and two rows of arrows represented by strings `a` and `b`. It then determines and prints 'YES' if there is no path from the left to the right side of the grid, and 'NO' otherwise. Specifically, it checks if the second-to-last arrow in `b` is not '>', and if so, prints 'NO'. If `n` is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if every second arrow in `b` (starting from index 0) is '>', and if not, it checks if every second arrow in `a` (starting from index 1) is '>'. If no such path exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.
