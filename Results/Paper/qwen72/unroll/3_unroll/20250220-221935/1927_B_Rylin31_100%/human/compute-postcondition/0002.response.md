The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it appears that the function is expected to work with the following inputs: `t` (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` (an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Given these inputs, the function is expected to return a suitable string `s` based on the provided trace.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). It returns a suitable string `s` based on the provided inputs.**
