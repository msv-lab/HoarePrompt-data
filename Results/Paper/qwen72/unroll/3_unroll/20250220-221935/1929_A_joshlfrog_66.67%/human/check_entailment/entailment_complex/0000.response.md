Reasoning:  
The given program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last. However, the program does not actually calculate the beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. Instead, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference.

To understand why this approach is incorrect, let's consider the definition of the beauty of the array:
- The beauty is the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

To maximize this sum, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the beauty as follows:
- For a sorted array, the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` will be minimized, and the beauty will be the sum of these differences.

However, the program simply finds the maximum and minimum values and prints their difference, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This approach will only work correctly in specific cases where the array has a very specific structure (e.g., all elements are the same, or the array is already sorted in a way that maximizes the beauty).

Let's analyze the example test cases:
1. For the array `[2, 1, 3]`, the correct beauty is `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`. The program prints `3 - 1 = 2`, which is correct by coincidence.
2. For the array `[69, 69, 69]`, the correct beauty is `0` because all elements are the same. The program prints `69 - 69 = 0`, which is correct.
3. For the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the correct beauty is obtained by sorting the array to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` and calculating the beauty as `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 87`. The program prints `100 - 43 = 57`, which is incorrect.
4. For the array `[3, 4, 3, 3]`, the correct beauty is obtained by sorting the array to `[3, 3, 3, 4]` and calculating the beauty as `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1`. The program prints `4 - 3 = 1`, which is correct by coincidence.
5. For the array `[2, 1]`, the correct beauty is `(2 - 1) = 1`. The program prints `2 - 1 = 1`, which is correct.

While the program produces the correct output for some test cases, it does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
