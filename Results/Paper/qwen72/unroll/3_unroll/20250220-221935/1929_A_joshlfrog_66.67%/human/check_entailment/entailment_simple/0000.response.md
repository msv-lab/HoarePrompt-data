Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any way. The key insight here is that to maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. This is because the sum of the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized when the elements are as far apart as possible.

However, the provided program does not sort the array. Instead, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference. This approach is incorrect because the difference between the maximum and minimum values does not necessarily represent the maximum beauty of the array.

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3]`. The maximum beauty is `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`, but the program will output `3 - 1 = 2`, which coincidentally is correct in this case. However, for the array `[1, 3, 2]`, the maximum beauty is `(3 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3`, but the program will still output `3 - 1 = 2`, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
