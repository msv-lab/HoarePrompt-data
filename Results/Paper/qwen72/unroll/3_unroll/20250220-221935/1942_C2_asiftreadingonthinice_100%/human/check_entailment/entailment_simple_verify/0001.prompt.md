You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to solve the given problem. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Each test case must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: The loop iterates `tt` times, processing each test case. For each test case, it calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by adding vertices to the existing set of vertices chosen by Bessie. The final output for each test case is the minimum of the calculated number of triangles (`ans`) and `n - 2`. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are updated for each test case, but the overall state of the program outside the loop remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices, and we can choose up to `y` additional vertices.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie and sorts them.

3. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The initial number of triangles `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is because each vertex can potentially form a triangle with two others, and we start with `x` vertices and can add up to `y` more.

4. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of vertices `a` to find gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap is exactly 2, it adds 1 to `ans` because a triangle can be formed.
   - If the gap is even, it adds the gap divided by 2 to a list `tmp` for further processing.

5. **Handling the Gap Between the Last and First Vertex:**
   - The program checks the gap between the last and first vertex (considering the polygon is cyclic).
   - If the gap is exactly 2, it adds 1 to `ans`.
   - If the gap is even, it adds the gap divided by 2 to the list `tmp`.

6. **Optimizing the Number of Triangles:**
   - The list `tmp` is sorted.
   - The program iterates through `tmp` and adds the number of triangles that can be formed from each gap to `ans` while ensuring that the number of additional vertices chosen does not exceed `y`.
   - If `y` is sufficient to cover the gap, it adds the number of triangles and decreases `y` by the number of vertices used.
   - If `y` is not sufficient, it breaks out of the loop.

7. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The program adds any remaining `y` vertices to `ans`.
   - It then prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2` because the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in a polygon with `n` sides is `n - 2`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the initial setup and input reading.
- It correctly identifies and processes gaps between chosen vertices.
- It optimizes the number of triangles by using the additional vertices `y` efficiently.
- The final adjustment ensures that the number of triangles does not exceed the maximum possible for the given polygon.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described, taking into account the constraints and the need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
