Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `w` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` indicating the number of sticks, followed by a list of integers `palka` representing the lengths of the sticks. The function then calculates and prints the number of shapes (sets of three sticks of the same length) that can be formed from the sticks in each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed output. **
