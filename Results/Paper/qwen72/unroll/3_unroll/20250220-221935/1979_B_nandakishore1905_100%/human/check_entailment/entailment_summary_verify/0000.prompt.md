You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif k % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            f = k - q
            while f & f - 1 != 0:
                l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
                p = len(l)
                q = 2 ** (p - 1)
                f = f - q
            print(f)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It processes a series of pairs of integers (n, m) provided through standard input. For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `k` is odd, it prints 1. If `k` is even and not a power of 2, it performs additional calculations to find the largest power of 2 less than `k` and prints the result of subtracting this power of 2 from `k`. The function does not modify any external variables.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to correctly compute the length of the longest common subsegment for certain inputs. Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Example Input:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

However, the program logic is flawed in the way it calculates the length of the longest common subsegment. The program uses the difference `k = abs(n - m)` and checks if `k & k - 1 == 0` to determine if `k` is a power of 2. If it is, it prints `k`. If `k` is odd, it prints `1`. If `k` is even, it performs a series of operations to find the largest power of 2 less than `k` and subtracts it from `k` until `k` becomes a power of 2, then prints the result.

This logic is incorrect because the length of the longest common subsegment is not necessarily related to the difference `k` in the way the program assumes. For example, consider the sequences generated by `x = 2` and `y = 3`:

- Sequence `a` (x = 2): [3, 0, 1, 6, 7, 4, 5, 2, ...]
- Sequence `b` (y = 3): [2, 1, 0, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, ...]

The longest common subsegment here is `[3]` with a length of 1, but the program's logic does not correctly capture this for all cases. The program's approach to finding the longest common subsegment is flawed and does not align with the problem description.
