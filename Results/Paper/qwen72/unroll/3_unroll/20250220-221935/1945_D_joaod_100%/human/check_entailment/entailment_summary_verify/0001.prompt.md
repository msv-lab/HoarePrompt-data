You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of people in a queue (`n`), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`m`), a list of costs to bribe each person in the queue (`a`), and a list of costs to bribe each person between positions (`b`). For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue and prints this cost. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the input variables remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `na_frente` and the maximum allowable final position `pos_final`.
   - It then reads the two lists of costs: `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

2. **Adjusting Indices**:
   - The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1. This is necessary because the problem uses 1-based indexing, while Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Initialization of Variables**:
   - `total` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the total cost Kirill spends.
   - `best` is initialized to `sys.float_info.max`, which will store the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` people.

4. **Loop Through the Queue**:
   - The loop iterates from `na_frente` (the last person in the queue) to 0 (the first person in the queue).
   - For each position `v` in the queue, the program checks if `v` is within the range of the first `m` positions (`v <= pos_final`).

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `v` is within the first `m` positions:
     - It updates `best` if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with the person at position `v` is less than the current `best`.
     - It then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
   - If `v` is not within the first `m` positions:
     - It simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all positions, the program prints the value of `best` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The program aims to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `m` people.
- The logic of updating `best` only when `v` is within the first `m` positions ensures that we are considering the minimum cost to reach a valid position.
- The program correctly adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total` to minimize the cost at each step.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `pos_final` is 0 (i.e., Kirill wants to be the first person in the queue). This could lead to incorrect results if `pos_final` is 0.
- The logic for updating `best` and `total` is not entirely clear. Specifically, the condition `if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` might not always find the optimal solution, especially if the cost to swap with the person at position `v` is very high.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic is generally correct for the given problem, but it might not handle edge cases (like `pos_final` being 0) correctly.
- The logic for updating `best` and `total` is not optimal and could lead to incorrect results in some scenarios.

Given these considerations, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
