### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the optimal position to place a road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side.
   - The road can be placed before the first house, after the last house, or between any two houses.
   - The goal is to find the position that is as close to the middle of the village as possible.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Input**: The function reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from the standard input.
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: It calculates the prefix sums of '0's and '1's in the string `a` and stores them in the list `S`. Each element `S[i]` contains the count of '0's and '1's up to the `i`-th character of `a`.
   - **Condition Check**: It iterates over all possible positions `i` (from 0 to `n`) to check if the road can be placed after the `i`-th house. The conditions are:
     - `left * 2 >= lsum`: At least half of the residents on the left side want to live on the left side.
     - `right * 2 >= rsum`: At least half of the residents on the right side want to live on the right side.
   - **Optimal Position Selection**: It keeps track of the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)` while satisfying the conditions.
   - **Output**: It prints the optimal position `i`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Input**: The function reads an integer `t` from the standard input, representing the number of test cases.
   - **Test Case Handling**: For each test case, it calls `func_1` to handle the input and output for that test case.
   - **No Return Value**: The function does not return any value, but it ensures that `func_1` is called for each test case.

4. **Combined Correctness**:
   - **Test Case Handling**: `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Optimal Position Calculation**: `func_1` correctly calculates the prefix sums and checks the conditions for each possible road position. It also correctly selects the position that is as close to the middle as possible.
   - **Output**: The output of `func_1` is correct for each test case, and `func_2` ensures that the output is generated for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct as it meets the problem description and handles multiple test cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
