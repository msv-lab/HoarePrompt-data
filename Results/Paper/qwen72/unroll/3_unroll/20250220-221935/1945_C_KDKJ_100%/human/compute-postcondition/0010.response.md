Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two inputs from the standard input: an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', representing the preferences of the residents. It then calculates and prints an index `i` (0 ≤ i ≤ n) that minimizes the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)` while ensuring that the number of '0's in the first `i` characters of `a` is at least half the length of the first `i` characters, and the number of '1's in the remaining characters of `a` is at least half the length of the remaining characters. If no such index exists, it prints `-1`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
