Precondition: **The function operates within a test case environment where the input is a sequence p of integers, which is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can interactively query the comparison of bitwise OR results between pairs of elements from the sequence p, and must find a pair of indices (i, j) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, using at most 3n queries.**
