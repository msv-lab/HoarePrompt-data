Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that there should not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_i \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). 

For example, consider the input \(x = 3\). The binary representation of 3 is "11". According to the problem description, the output should be an array where no two consecutive elements are non-zero. However, the program will output an array like \([1, 1]\) or \([1, 0, 1]\), which does not satisfy this condition. Specifically, the program does not correctly adjust the array to ensure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
