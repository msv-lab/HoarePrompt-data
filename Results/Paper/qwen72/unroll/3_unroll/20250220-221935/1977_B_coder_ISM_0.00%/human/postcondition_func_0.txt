The function `func` processes a series of positive integers `x` (where 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30) provided by the user. For each integer, it converts `x` into a 30-bit binary string `s` and then modifies `s` according to specific rules. These rules involve flipping bits and potentially adding an extra bit if a carry is generated. The function prints the original 30-bit binary string, the modified length of the binary string (which can be 30 or 31), and the final modified binary string. The function does not return any value. After processing all `t` inputs, the final state of the program is that `t` is 0, `x` is the last input integer, `s` is the final modified binary string, and `length` is the length of the modified `s` (either 30 or 31).
