Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Output Format**: The program prints the array `s` before it has been fully processed, which is incorrect. The array `s` should be processed completely before printing the length and the array.

2. **Handling of `-1` and `1`**: The logic for converting `1` to `-1` and ensuring that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist is flawed. The program attempts to handle this by setting flags and adjusting elements, but it does not correctly propagate the changes to ensure the final array meets the constraints.

3. **Array Length**: The program always initializes the array `s` with a length of 30, which is not necessary. The length of the array should be determined based on the binary representation of `x` and the adjustments made to avoid consecutive non-zero elements.

4. **Incorrect Propagation**: The program does not correctly handle the propagation of `-1` and `1` values to ensure that the final array meets the constraints. For example, if `x = 14`, the binary representation is `1110`, and the program should convert this to `[0, -1, 0, 0, 1]` to avoid consecutive non-zero elements, but the current logic does not achieve this.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to:

1. Convert the integer `x` to its binary representation.
2. Adjust the binary representation to avoid consecutive non-zero elements by converting `11` to `0101` (i.e., `11` to `0 -1 0 1`).
3. Ensure the final array meets the constraints and has the correct length.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        binary = bin(x)[2:]  # Convert x to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
        n = len(binary)
        a = [0] * (n + 1)  # Initialize the array with an extra element to handle carry

        carry = 0
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if binary[i] == '1':
                if carry == 0:
                    a[i] = 1
                    carry = 1
                else:
                    a[i] = -1
                    carry = 0
            else:
                if carry == 1:
                    a[i] = 1
                    carry = 1
                else:
                    a[i] = 0

        if carry == 1:
            a[0] = 1
            n += 1

        # Remove leading zeros
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
            n -= 1

        print(n)
        print(*a)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Binary Conversion**: Convert `x` to its binary representation and store it in `binary`.
2. **Array Initialization**: Initialize an array `a` with an extra element to handle potential carry.
3. **Carry Handling**: Iterate through the binary representation from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. Adjust the array `a` to avoid consecutive non-zero elements by using a carry mechanism.
4. **Final Adjustments**: If there is a carry left after processing all bits, set the first element of `a` to `1` and increase the length `n` by 1.
5. **Remove Leading Zeros**: Remove any leading zeros from the array `a` to ensure the correct length.
6. **Output**: Print the length `n` and the array `a`.

This corrected program should meet the problem's constraints and produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
