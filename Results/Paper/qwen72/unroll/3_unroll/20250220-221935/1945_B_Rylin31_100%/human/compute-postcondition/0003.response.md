The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^18. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
