The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function, and `nums` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, which is already in the correct state and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0**
