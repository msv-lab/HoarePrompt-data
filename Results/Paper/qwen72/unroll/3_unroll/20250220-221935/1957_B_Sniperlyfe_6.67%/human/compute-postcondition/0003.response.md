Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `k` is `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`. The last element of `nums` is now `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.** 

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.
- The code `nums[-1] += k` increments the last element of `nums` by the updated value of `k`.
- Therefore, the last element of `nums` is now `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.
- All other elements of `nums` and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
