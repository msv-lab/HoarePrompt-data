You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

    1 1
    
Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `make_stairs` accepts a non-negative integer `i`. It checks if the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is already in a "staircase" form where each element equals its index. If it is, the function returns `None`. If not, it modifies the subarray to ensure it forms a staircase by setting all elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` to `i` and records the operation in the list `res`. The function ensures that by the end of its execution, the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is in the staircase form, and `res` contains the operations performed to achieve this.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the elements of the array by performing the specified operations. One issue is in the `func_1` function, where the calculation of `res` is incorrect. The function is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum of the array segment from `start_index` to `end_index`, but the logic used to calculate `res` does not seem to align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the use of `(end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2` does not represent the MEX operation or the correct way to maximize the sum.

Another issue is in the `make_stairs` function, which attempts to modify the array to form a "staircase" of MEX values. However, the function does not correctly handle the MEX calculation or the updates to the array. For example, the function does not ensure that the smallest non-negative integer missing from the segment is used, and it incorrectly assumes that the MEX value for a segment can be directly set to `i` without considering the actual values in the segment.

A specific case where the program fails is:
```
Input:
3
0 2 1

Expected Output:
6 1
1 3

Actual Output:
The program will not produce the correct output because the logic in `func_1` and `make_stairs` is flawed.
```

In this case, the correct operation would be to set the entire array to the MEX of the segment `[0, 2, 1]`, which is `3`, resulting in the array `[3, 3, 3]` and a sum of `9`. However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this scenario.
