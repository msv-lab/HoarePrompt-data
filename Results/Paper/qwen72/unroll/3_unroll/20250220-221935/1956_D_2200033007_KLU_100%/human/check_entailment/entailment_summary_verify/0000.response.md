### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and validate the assessment using the function summaries and the problem description.

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum of the array segment from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - **Issues**:
     - The initial value of `res` is set to `(end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2`, which is incorrect. This value does not represent the MEX operation or the correct way to maximize the sum.
     - The function attempts to recursively compute the maximum sum by splitting the array into segments and adding the MEX value of the middle element, but this approach does not align with the problem's requirements. The MEX value should be computed for the entire segment, not just individual elements.
     - The function does not correctly handle the MEX calculation for the segment. The MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the segment, and the function does not compute this value.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is intended to construct the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum.
   - **Issues**:
     - The function relies on the incorrect results from `func_1`, which means it will not produce the correct sequence of operations.
     - The logic for checking if the maximum value is `length ** 2` and then calling `make_stairs` is flawed. The MEX value for a segment is not necessarily the square of the segment length.
     - The function does not correctly handle the MEX calculation or the updates to the array.

3. **Function 3 (`make_stairs`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is intended to modify the subarray to form a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - **Issues**:
     - The function assumes that the MEX value for a segment can be directly set to `i` without considering the actual values in the segment. This is incorrect because the MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the segment.
     - The function does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. It simply sets all elements in the subarray to `i`, which is not the correct MEX value.
     - The function does not ensure that the smallest non-negative integer missing from the segment is used.

### Specific Example Analysis:
- **Input**:
  ```
  3
  0 2 1
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  6 1
  1 3
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  - The program will not produce the correct output because the logic in `func_1` and `make_stairs` is flawed.
  - The correct operation would be to set the entire array to the MEX of the segment `[0, 2, 1]`, which is `3`, resulting in the array `[3, 3, 3]` and a sum of `9`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the elements of the array by performing the specified operations. The issues in `func_1` and `make_stairs` are significant and prevent the program from producing the correct results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
