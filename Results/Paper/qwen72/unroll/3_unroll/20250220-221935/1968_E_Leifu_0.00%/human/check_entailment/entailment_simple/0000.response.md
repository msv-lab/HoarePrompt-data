Reasoning:

The program's goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program attempts to achieve this by printing a specific set of points for each test case.

Let's break down the program's logic and evaluate its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case by reading \(n\).

2. **Output for Each Test Case:**
   - The program always prints the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) for each test case.
   - If \(n = 3\), it prints an additional point \((2, 3)\).
   - If \(n > 3\), it prints \((2, 4)\) and then for each integer \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) (inclusive), it prints \((j, j)\).

3. **Evaluation of the Output:**
   - For \(n = 2\), the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) are printed. The Manhattan distances are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 2\).

   - For \(n = 3\), the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\) are printed. The Manhattan distances are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - \(|1-2| + |1-3| = 3\)
     - \(|1-2| + |2-3| = 2\)
     - \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\).

   - For \(n > 3\), the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) are printed. Let's evaluate the distances:
     - The points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) contribute the distances 0 and 1.
     - The point \((2, 4)\) contributes additional distances:
       - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
       - \(|2-2| + |1-4| = 3\)
       - \(|2-2| + |2-4| = 2\)
     - The points \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) contribute distances:
       - \(|1-j| + |1-j| = 2(j-1)\)
       - \(|1-j| + |2-j| = 2(j-1) - 1\)
       - \(|2-j| + |4-j| = 2(j-2) + 2\)
       - \(|j-j| + |j-j| = 0\)
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will include all these distances, and for \(n > 3\), the distances \(2(j-1)\) and \(2(j-1) - 1\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) will ensure a large number of distinct distances.

However, the program has a logical issue for \(n > 3\):

- For \(n = 4\), the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\) are printed. The distances are:
  - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
  - \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\)
  - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
  - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
  - \(|2-2| + |1-4| = 3\)
  - \(|2-2| + |2-4| = 2\)
  - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
  - \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
  - \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
  - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 7. This is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 4\), which should be 10.

- For \(n = 5\), the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\) are printed. The distances are:
  - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
  - \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\)
  - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
  - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
  - \(|2-2| + |1-4| = 3\)
  - \(|2-2| + |2-4| = 2\)
  - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
  - \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
  - \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
  - \(|1-5| + |1-5| = 8\)
  - \(|1-5| + |2-5| = 7\)
  - \(|2-5| + |4-5| = 3\)
  - \(|4-5| + |4-5| = 2\)
  - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which has a size of 9. This is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 5\), which should be 13.

- For \(n = 6\), the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\) are printed. The distances are:
  - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
  - \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\)
  - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
  - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
  - \(|2-2| + |1-4| = 3\)
  - \(|2-2| + |2-4| = 2\)
  - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
  - \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
  - \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
  - \(|1-5| + |1-5| = 8\)
  - \(|1-5| + |2-5| = 7\)
  - \(|2-5| + |4-5| = 3\)
  - \(|4-5| + |4-5| = 2\)
  - \(|1-6| + |1-6| = 10\)
  - \(|1-6| + |2-6| = 9\)
  - \(|2-6| + |4-6| =
