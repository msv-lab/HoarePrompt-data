The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is expected to handle multiple test cases internally, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For each test case, the function should generate and return `n` points that maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.

Functionality: **The function generates and returns `n` points for each test case, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these points is maximized.**
