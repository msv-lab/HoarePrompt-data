Output State: **`arr` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the initial number of stones in the i-th pile, `A` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `A` is assigned the value `False`. The state of `arr` remains unchanged, as it is still a list of n integers where each integer represents the initial number of stones in the i-th pile.
