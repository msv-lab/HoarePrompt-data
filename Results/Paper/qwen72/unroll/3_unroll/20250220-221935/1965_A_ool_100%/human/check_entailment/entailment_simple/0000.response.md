### Reasoning:
The given program is designed to determine the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where the players take turns removing a positive integer \( k \) stones from each nonempty pile, with \( k \) being at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile. The player who cannot make a move loses.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. **Initial Setup**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
2. **Input Reading**: For each test case, it reads the number of piles \( n \) and the list of pile sizes \( arr \).
3. **Function Call**: It calls the function `func_1` with the list of pile sizes \( arr \).
4. **Function Logic**:
   - **Initial Check**: If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing \( k \) equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles in one move.
   - **Unique and Sorted Pile Sizes**: The program creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes `set_`.
   - **Gap Check**: It iterates through the sorted list to check if there is any gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements. If such a gap exists, it toggles the boolean variable `A` (which starts as `False`).
   - **Final Toggle**: If there is no gap greater than 1, it toggles `A` one more time.
   - **Result**: The function returns "Alice" if `A` is `True` and "Bob" if `A` is `False`.

### Analysis:
- **Initial Check**: If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice wins immediately. This is correct because Alice can choose \( k \) equal to the smallest pile size and empty all piles in one move.
- **Unique and Sorted Pile Sizes**: Sorting the unique pile sizes helps in checking for gaps.
- **Gap Check**: The gap check is crucial. If there is a gap greater than 1, it means that the players can always choose a \( k \) that will leave the game in a state where the next player can win. This is because the presence of a gap greater than 1 allows the current player to force the next player into a losing position.
- **Final Toggle**: If there is no gap greater than 1, the final toggle ensures that the player who starts (Alice) will lose if the number of unique pile sizes is odd, and win if it is even. This is because each move toggles the state, and if there are no gaps, the game will end when the last pile is emptied, which will be on the turn of the player who started if the number of unique pile sizes is odd.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the game rules and the properties of the pile sizes. The initial check, gap check, and final toggle are all necessary and correctly implemented.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
