Functionality: ** The function operates in an interactive environment to find and print a pair of indices (maxi, mini) from a permutation sequence p, such that the bitwise XOR of p[maxi] and p[mini] is maximized. The function takes no parameters and reads input values interactively. After processing, it prints the pair of indices (maxi, mini) that achieve the maximum XOR value. The variables `maxi` and `mini` will hold the indices of the elements in the permutation p that achieve this maximum XOR value. **
