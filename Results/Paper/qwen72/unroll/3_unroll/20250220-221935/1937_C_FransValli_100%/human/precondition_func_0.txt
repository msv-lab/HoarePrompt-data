The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is a sequence of queries and responses. The sequence p is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries, and each query involves four indices a, b, c, d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n). The response to each query is one of "<", "=", or ">", indicating the result of the comparison between (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The function must find and output a pair of indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
