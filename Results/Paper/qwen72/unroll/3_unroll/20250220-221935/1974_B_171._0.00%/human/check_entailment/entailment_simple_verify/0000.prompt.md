You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

    #State: Output State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, `decoded` is a list of lowercase Latin letters where each letter corresponds to the mapped value of the character in `encoded` based on the `mapping` dictionary.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string that is the decoded version of `encoded`, where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding mapped value from the `mapping` dictionary.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the construction of the `mapping` dictionary, which is supposed to map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the original string based on the symmetric property of the auxiliary string `r`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
10
serofedsoc
```

**Expected Output:**
```
codeforces
```

**Actual Output:**
```
abcdeffedc
```

The program incorrectly maps each character in the encoded string to a new character without considering the symmetric property of the auxiliary string `r`. For example, it maps 's' to 'a', 'e' to 'b', and so on, instead of mapping 's' to 'c', 'e' to 'o', and so on, as required by the problem description. This results in an incorrect decoded string.
