The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. The decoded string is generated by mapping each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, ensuring that each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding mapped value. The final state of the program is that `encoded` remains unchanged, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, and `decoded` is a list of these mapped letters which is then joined into a single string and returned.
