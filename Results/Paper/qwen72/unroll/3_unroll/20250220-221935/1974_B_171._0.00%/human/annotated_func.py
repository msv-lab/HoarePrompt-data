    #State: Output State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, `decoded` is a list of lowercase Latin letters where each letter corresponds to the mapped value of the character in `encoded` based on the `mapping` dictionary.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string that is the decoded version of `encoded`, where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding mapped value from the `mapping` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. The decoded string is generated by mapping each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, ensuring that each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding mapped value. The final state of the program is that `encoded` remains unchanged, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, and `decoded` is a list of these mapped letters which is then joined into a single string and returned.
