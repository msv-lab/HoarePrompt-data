You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: Output State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, `decoded` is a list of lowercase Latin letters where each letter corresponds to the mapped value of the character in `encoded` based on the `mapping` dictionary.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string that is the decoded version of `encoded`, where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding mapped value from the `mapping` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string where each character is replaced by its corresponding mapped value from the `mapping` dictionary.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string that is the decoded version of `encoded`, where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding mapped value from the `mapping` dictionary.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
