The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0. This means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the loop will always execute at least once because `n - 1` will be at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure the loop executes. However, for clarity, we can state that `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 0, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True**
