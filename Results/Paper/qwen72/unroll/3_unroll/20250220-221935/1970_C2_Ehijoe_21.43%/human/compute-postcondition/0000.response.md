Output State: **`n` and `t` are updated to the values provided by `input().split()`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `t` is an integer and always equals 1. `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `t` are updated to the integers provided by the `input().split()`.
- The value of `t` is always 1, so after the update, `t` will still be 1.
- The value of `n` will be within the range 2 to 2 * 10^5.
- The variables `nodes` and `start` remain unchanged and retain their initial properties.
