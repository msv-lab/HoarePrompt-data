Output State: `n` and `t` remain unchanged. `nodes` remains a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key from 1 to n (inclusive) has a list of integers representing the nodes it is connected to. `start` remains unchanged. `edges` is an empty list. `empty` is False. `leaves` is a deque containing all the keys from `nodes` whose corresponding list has exactly one element.
