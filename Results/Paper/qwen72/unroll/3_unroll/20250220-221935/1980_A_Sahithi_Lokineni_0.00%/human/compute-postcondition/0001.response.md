The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `list_of_tuples`, and `list_of_strings`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `list_of_tuples` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5).
- `list_of_strings` is a list of strings, each of length `n` and composed of characters 'A' to 'G'.
- The length of `list_of_tuples` and `list_of_strings` should be equal to `t`.

The function always returns 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, a list of tuples `list_of_tuples` where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of strings `list_of_strings` where each string is of length `n` and composed of characters 'A' to 'G'. The function returns 0.**
