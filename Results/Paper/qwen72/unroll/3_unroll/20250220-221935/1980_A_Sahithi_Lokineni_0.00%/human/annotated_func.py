#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000), a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5), and a list of strings a, each of length n and composed of characters 'A' to 'G'. The length of the list of tuples and the list of strings a should be equal to t.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns 0. It does not modify any external state or variables.
