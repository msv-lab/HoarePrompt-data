Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it uses an undefined function `default_value` in the `defaultdict` initialization. The correct way to initialize a `defaultdict` with a default value of 0 is to use `int` as the default factory function. Here is the corrected line:

```python
d = defaultdict(int)
```

Additionally, the function `func_1` is defined but never used, which is unnecessary and can be removed to clean up the code.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version should work correctly for all potential cases.
