Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array `arr` contains a zero. When a zero is present in the array, the product of all elements will be zero, and any subsequent division by an element (even zero) will not change the product. However, the program attempts to divide by elements of the array, which can lead to incorrect results or division by zero errors.

Example Input:
```
1
4 6
3 0 4 2
LRRL
```

Expected Output:
```
0 0 0 0
```

Actual Output:
The program will attempt to divide by zero, leading to a runtime error.

This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
