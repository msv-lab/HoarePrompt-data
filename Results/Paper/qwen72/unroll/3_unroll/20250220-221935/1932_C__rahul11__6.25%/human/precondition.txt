t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples, each containing two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a list of integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), and a string s of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
