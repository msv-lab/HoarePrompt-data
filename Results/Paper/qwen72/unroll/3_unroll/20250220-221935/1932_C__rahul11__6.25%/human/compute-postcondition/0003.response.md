Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It is expected to process multiple test cases, each defined by integers n and m, a list a of n integers, and a string s of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the input values n, m, a, and s. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
