Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program has a few issues:

1. **Incorrect MOD Value**: The program uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6`, but this is not necessary for the problem. The problem only requires taking the remainder with respect to `m`, not with respect to a large modulus like `10 ** 9 + 6`.

2. **Division and Modulo Operation**: The program uses integer division (`//`) to remove elements from the product. However, this can lead to incorrect results because the product `ans` might not be an integer multiple of the element being removed, especially after taking the modulo `m`. For example, if `ans` is `12` and `m` is `5`, and you remove an element `3`, the correct product should be `4` (since `12 // 3 = 4`), but after taking `ans % m`, the value might be altered, and the division might not yield the correct result.

3. **Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product calculation should be done modulo `m` to avoid overflow and to ensure that the product remains within the bounds of `m`.

4. **Output Format**: The program should output the results for each test case on a new line, but it currently prints all results on a single line.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(1, n):
            if s[k-1] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[l], m-2, m)) % m  # Use modular inverse to divide
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[r], m-2, m)) % m  # Use modular inverse to divide
                r -= 1
            res[k] = ans
        print(*res)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product is calculated modulo `m` to avoid overflow and to ensure the product is within the bounds of `m`.

2. **Modular Inverse for Division**: To correctly "divide" by an element in the product, we use the modular inverse. The modular inverse of `a` modulo `m` is `a^(m-2) % m` (using Fermat's Little Theorem for `m` being a prime number). This ensures that the division is done correctly under modulo `m`.

3. **Output Format**: The results for each test case are printed on a new line, as required.

This corrected program should now handle the problem correctly and produce the expected output.
