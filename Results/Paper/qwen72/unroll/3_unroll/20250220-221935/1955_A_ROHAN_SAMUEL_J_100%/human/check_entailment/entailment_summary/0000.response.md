Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts when given the price of one yogurt (`a`), and the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`). The logic in the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2` is true):**
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price. Hence, the program prints `a * n`.
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is greater than or equal to the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and buy the remaining single yogurt at the regular price. Hence, the program prints `n // 2 * b + a`.

2. **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2` is false):**
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price. Hence, the program prints `a * n`.
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is greater than or equal to the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price. Hence, the program prints `n // 2 * b`.

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 9`.
  - The program should print `a * n = 5 * 2 = 10`, but it prints `9` (which is the promotional price for two yogurts, and it is indeed the minimum cost).

- **Test Case 2: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` is greater than `b = 9`.
  - The program should print `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 3: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 11`.
  - The program should print `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 4: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 11`.
  - The program should print `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`, which is correct.

The program correctly handles both odd and even cases and computes the minimum cost based on the given conditions. The logic is sound and matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
