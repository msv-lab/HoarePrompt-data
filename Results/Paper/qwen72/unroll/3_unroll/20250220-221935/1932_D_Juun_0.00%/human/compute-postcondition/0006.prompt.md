Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three parameters: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a character representing the trump suit (one of "CDHS"), and a list of 2n unique two-character strings representing the cards in the discard pile. Each card string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"). The value of `trump` is now a character representing the trump suit (one of "CDHS"). The variable `trumps` is an empty list. The variable `answers` is an empty list. The variable `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', and all values are set to `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
