Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `a` from the user input. The function then checks the string `a` for the number of occurrences of the character '1'. If the count of '1's is 0, greater than 2 and even, or exactly 2 with the two '1's not adjacent, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify any external variables or state. **
