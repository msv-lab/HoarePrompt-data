The function `func` is expected to accept two parameters: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell with a chip. At least one cell in each test case contains a chip. The function returns the number of chips (1s) in the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell. It returns the number of cells that contain a chip (1).**
