You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` indicating the number of cells, and a string `arr` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, where '1' represents a cell with a chip and '0' represents a free cell. It then calculates and prints the number of free cells (i.e., '0's) between the first and last chip (i.e., '1's) in the string `arr`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will hold the values from the last test case processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arr` representing the ribbon.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - The program uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip (leftmost chip).
   - It uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip (rightmost chip) from the end of the array. This is equivalent to finding the index of the last chip from the start of the array.

3. **Extracting the Subarray:**
   - The program extracts the subarray `z` that contains all the cells from the first chip to the last chip using `arr[x:n - y]`.
   - This subarray `z` will contain all the chips and any free cells between them.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program then counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the subarray `z` using `z.count('0')`.
   - This count represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips so that they form a single block without any free cells between them.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the first and last chip positions.
- By extracting the subarray from the first chip to the last chip, it ensures that all chips and the free cells between them are considered.
- Counting the free cells in this subarray gives the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles cases where all chips are already in a single block (output is `0`).
- It also handles cases where there are multiple free cells between chips.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It follows the logic of finding the first and last chip, extracting the relevant subarray, and counting the free cells in between.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
