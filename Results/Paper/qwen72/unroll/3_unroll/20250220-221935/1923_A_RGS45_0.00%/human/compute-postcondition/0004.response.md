Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` indicating the number of cells, and a string `arr` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, where '1' represents a cell with a chip and '0' represents a free cell. It then calculates and prints the number of free cells (i.e., '0's) between the first and last chip (i.e., '1's) in the string `arr`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will hold the values from the last test case processed. **
