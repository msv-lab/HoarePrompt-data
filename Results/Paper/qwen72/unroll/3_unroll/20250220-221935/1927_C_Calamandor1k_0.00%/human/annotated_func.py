#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))

        count_a, count_b = 0, 0
        
        d = k // 2
        
        for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
            if len_a > i + 1:
                if a[i] <= k:
                    count_a += 1
            if len_b > i + 1:
                if b[i] <= k:
                    count_b += 1

    #State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are the last input integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is the last input even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), a is the last input list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b is the last input list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6, len_a is the length of the last input list a, len_b is the length of the last input list b, count_a is the number of elements in the last input list a that are less than or equal to k and within the first max(len_a, len_b) elements, count_b is the number of elements in the last input list b that are less than or equal to k and within the first max(len_a, len_b) elements, d is k // 2, and the loop has printed 'YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d, otherwise 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then checks if at least `k // 2` elements in the first `max(n, m)` elements of both `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k`. If this condition is met for both lists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes, and the program state includes the last values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, `count_a`, `count_b`, and `d` as described in the annotations.
