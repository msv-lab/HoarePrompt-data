The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. 

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements:
  - An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array.
  - A list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array `a`.

The function returns a list `results`, where each integer in `results` represents the number of operations required to make all elements in the corresponding array greater than the initial median of that array.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the number of operations required to make all elements in the corresponding array greater than the initial median of that array.**
