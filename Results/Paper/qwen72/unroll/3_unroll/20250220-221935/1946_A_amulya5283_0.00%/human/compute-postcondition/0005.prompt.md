You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array a. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, arr = test_cases[i]
        
        arr.sort()
        
        median_index = n // 2
        
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        
        operations = 0
        
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array a. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of operations required to make all elements in the corresponding array greater than the initial median of that array.
    return results
    #The program returns the list `results`, where each integer in `results` represents the number of operations required to make all elements in the corresponding array greater than the initial median of that array.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the number of operations required to make all elements in the corresponding array greater than the initial median of that array.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `results`, where each integer in `results` represents the number of operations required to make all elements in the corresponding array greater than the initial median of that array.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
