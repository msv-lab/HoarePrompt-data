### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common and efficient approach for handling large inputs.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case, storing them in a list `test_cases`. This is done correctly.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, the program extracts the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.
   - The array is sorted using `arr.sort()`, which is necessary to find the median. This step is correct.

3. **Median Calculation:**
   - The median index is calculated as `median_index = n // 2`. This is correct for arrays with odd lengths.
   - For even lengths, the median is defined as the element at index `n // 2` in the sorted array, which is consistent with the problem description.

4. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A min-heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is done to efficiently manage the elements that are greater than or equal to the current median.
   - The heap is initialized correctly using `heapq.heapify(heap)`.

5. **Operation Counting:**
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
   - Each increment operation is counted, and the total number of operations required to increase the median is stored in `results`.
   - The logic of incrementing the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median is correct. This ensures that the median is increased with the minimum number of operations.

6. **Output:**
   - The results are printed for each test case. This is done correctly.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
  - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array `a`. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
  - This state is correct and matches the problem description.

- **State Inside Function:**
  - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted.
  - The median index is calculated as `median_index = n // 2`.
  - The current median is set to `current_median = arr[median_index]`.
  - A min-heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array.
  - The heap is heapified using `heapq.heapify(heap)`.
  - The program then enters a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
  - The number of operations is counted and stored in `results`.
  - This state is correct and matches the problem description.

- **State After Function Call:**
  - `results` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of operations required to make all elements in the corresponding array greater than the initial median of that array.
  - The program returns the list `results`, and the results are printed for each test case.
  - This state is correct and matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input efficiently, calculates the median correctly, and uses a min-heap to count the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median. The annotations confirm that the program's state and behavior are consistent with the problem requirements.
