Reasoning:

1. **Function Call and Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is indeed called inside the loop that iterates `tc` times. However, the function itself does not take any arguments, which is a mismatch with the problem description. The function should take the array `a` and the list of queries as arguments. This is a significant issue that needs to be addressed.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The `input` function is redefined inside `func_1`, which can cause issues if the program is run in an environment where `input` is not available or is used elsewhere. This is a valid concern, but in the context of this specific problem, it is not a critical issue because the program is designed to read from `sys.stdin`.

3. **Logic Errors**:
   - The logic for handling queries is flawed. The program uses a binary search to find the first and last occurrences of a number in the array, but it does not correctly handle the case where the array contains multiple different numbers within the query range. The program assumes that the array is segmented into contiguous blocks of the same number, and it uses these segments to determine if a pair of different elements exists.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the query range contains only one unique number. For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` and the query is `(1, 5)`, the program should output `-1 -1` because there are no two different elements in the range. However, the current logic does not handle this case correctly.
   - The program also does not handle the case where the query range is very small (e.g., `(1, 2)` in an array with two identical elements) or where the query range is the entire array.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the query range is very small or where the query range is the entire array. For example, if the array is `[1, 1]` and the query is `(1, 2)`, the program should output `-1 -1` because there are no two different elements in the range. However, the current logic may not handle this case correctly.

5. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program does not always output the correct indices for the elements. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the query is `(1, 5)`, the program should output any pair of different elements, but the current logic may not always provide a valid pair.

To demonstrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following input:

```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
1 5
```

The expected output is:
```
-1 -1
```

However, the program will not correctly handle this case and may output incorrect indices. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
