You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not defined with any parameters, but based on the problem description, it should take a list of integers `a` and a list of queries, where each query is a pair of integers `(l, r)`. The list `a` contains `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The list of queries contains `q` queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each query `(l, r)` satisfies 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads from standard input and processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes a list of integers `nums` and a series of queries, where each query is a pair of integers `(l, r)`. The function identifies contiguous segments of the same integer in `nums` and stores these segments in a list `arr`, where each element is a tuple `(start, end, value)`. For each query `(l, r)`, the function determines if there is a valid segment boundary within the range `[l, r]` and prints the indices of the segment boundary. If no valid boundary exists, it prints `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to standard output. The final state of the program includes the list `nums` with an additional `-1` appended, the list `arr` containing the segment boundaries, and the variables `N`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `LA`, and `ppp` (if defined) retaining their final values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Array Processing:**
   - The program appends a `-1` to the end of the array `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It then iterates through the array to group consecutive identical elements into a list of tuples `arr`. Each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of the group.
   - This step is intended to help quickly find the boundaries of different elements in the array.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the first group that starts at or after the query's left boundary `l`.
   - It then checks if the start of the group is greater than `l` and if the end of the group is less than `r`.
   - If the start of the group is greater than `l`, it prints the indices of the last element of the previous group and the first element of the current group.
   - If the end of the group is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no different elements exist in the range.
   - If the end of the group is less than `r`, it prints the indices of the first element of the current group and the first element of the next group.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program includes a debug print statement for `ppp == 23`, which is not necessary for the problem and can be ignored.
   - The program also includes a condition `if tc > 5` to skip some queries, which is not part of the problem requirements and can lead to incorrect results.

5. **Logical Errors:**
   - The condition `if tc > 5` is a logical error because it skips some queries without processing them, leading to incorrect output.
   - The program does not handle the case where the range `l` to `r` contains only one unique element correctly. It should check if there are any different elements within the range.

### Correctness:
Given the logical error in the query handling and the unnecessary conditions, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
