To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `N`. The loop will execute if `N + 1` is greater than 0, meaning `N` must be at least 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range`.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with an additional `-1` appended at the end.
- `N` is an input integer.
- `s` is 0.
- `e` is 0.
- `num` is the first integer in `nums`.
- `arr` is an empty list.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `N` is at least 0, and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with an additional `-1` appended at the end, `N` must be at least 0, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in `nums`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
