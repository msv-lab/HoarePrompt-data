To determine what will be printed when the `print(nums)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`nums`**: This is a list of integers obtained from the input, with an additional `-1` appended at the end.
2. **`N`**: This is an input integer.
3. **`s`**: This is equal to `N`.
4. **`e`**: This is 0.
5. **`num`**: This is `-1`.
6. **`arr`**: This is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the start and end indices of a contiguous segment of the same integer in `nums`, along with the integer itself.
7. **`LA`**: This is `len(arr) - 1`.
8. **`ppp`**: This is 23.

The `print(nums)` statement will print the list `nums`. Since `nums` is described as a list of integers obtained from the input with an additional `-1` appended at the end, the output will be the input list followed by `-1`.

Let's assume the input list of integers is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`. Then `nums` would be `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, -1]`.

Output: **[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, -1] (where the input list is the list of integers provided by the user, and `-1` is appended at the end)**

If the input list is different, the output will reflect that list with `-1` appended at the end. For example, if the input list is `[4, 5, 6]`, then `nums` would be `[4, 5, 6, -1]`.

Output: **[4, 5, 6, -1] (where the input list is the list of integers provided by the user, and `-1` is appended at the end)**

In general, the output will be the input list of integers followed by `-1`.

Output: **[input_list, -1] (where input_list is the list of integers provided by the user, and `-1` is appended at the end)**
