The code snippet `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)` sets the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack to 1,000,000. This change affects the recursion limit but does not alter any other variables or the input/output behavior of the function `func`.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, each describing an undirected weighted graph. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1)/2, 2·10^5)) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The next m lines each contain three integers u, v, and w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6) — indicating an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. The graph does not contain loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. The sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The output for each test case should include the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, the number of vertices in the cycle, and the vertices of the cycle in traversal order. The recursion limit is now set to 1,000,000.**
