The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function operates with multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function is expected to return a result for each test case.

Since the output is not specified in the prompt, we can infer that the function likely processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case. However, without more specific information on the output, we can only describe the parameters and the general expectation of the function.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it accepts two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a` and `b`.**
