Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program's logic for calculating the sum is indeed flawed. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( n \times \left( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \right) \). This is because each row and each column will contain the numbers from 1 to \( n \), and the sum of these numbers is \( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \). Therefore, the total sum for the matrix is \( n \times \left( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \right) \).
   - The program's current logic does not match this calculation. It adds \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) and \( i \times n \) in a loop, which is not the correct approach.

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program calculates the number of operations as `n + r`, where `r` is determined in a loop. This does not ensure that the number of operations is no more than \( 2n \).
   - The problem description guarantees that the maximum sum can always be obtained in no more than \( 2n \) operations. The program should ensure that it does not exceed this limit. The current logic does not guarantee this.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program's output format is correct in terms of the structure (it prints the type of operation, the row or column, and the permutation). However, the logic for determining the number of operations and the sum is incorrect, which can lead to incorrect outputs.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the sum of the matrix, we can perform the following operations:
- Perform \( n \) Type 1 operations, each setting a different row to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
- Perform \( n \) Type 2 operations, each setting a different column to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

This ensures that each row and each column contains the numbers from 1 to \( n \), and the total sum is \( n \times \left( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \) \).

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible sum
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        
        # Number of operations (2n)
        num_operations = 2 * n
        
        print(max_sum, num_operations)
        
        # Perform n Type 1 operations
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
        # Perform n Type 2 operations
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Example Case:
For \( n = 2 \):
- The maximum possible sum is \( 7 \).
- The program should output:
  ```
  7 4
  1 1 1 2
  1 2 1 2
  2 1 1 2
  2 2 1 2
  ```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The given program does not correctly handle the operations to maximize the sum of the matrix and does not ensure that the number of operations is no more than \( 2n \). The logic for sum calculation and operation count is flawed.

Final: **False**
