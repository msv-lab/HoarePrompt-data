Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). For each test case, the function calculates a sum and a value `r` based on the conditions provided in the loop. It then prints the sum and the value `n + r`. Additionally, it prints a series of lines, each containing a row of the matrix, with the first element being either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `j` (1 to `n + r`). The function does not return any values; all results are printed to standard output. **
