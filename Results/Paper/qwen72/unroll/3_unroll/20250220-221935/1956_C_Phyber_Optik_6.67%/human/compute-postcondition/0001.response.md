The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `n` is mentioned but not part of the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted here. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop itself, starting from 0.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `n` is not relevant to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
