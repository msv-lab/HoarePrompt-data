The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to read input from stdin or another source, where the input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), representing the size of a matrix. The function processes each test case and returns the result for each matrix size `n`.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from stdin, where each test case contains an integer `n` representing the size of a matrix. It returns the result for each matrix size `n`.**
