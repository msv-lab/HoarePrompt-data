### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`**:
   - The program modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`. This step is correct as it follows the problem description where each element `a_i` is modified to `a_i + i + 1`.

3. **Counting Unique Elements**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element in `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts the set in descending order. This step is correct and ensures that we have a sorted list of unique elements.

4. **Constructing the Array `b`**:
   - The program initializes `cnt` to the number of elements in `a` that are not unique (i.e., `n - len(a)`).
   - It iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a` and constructs the array `b` by adding the largest possible elements that are not already in `b` and are less than the current element.
   - The `cur` variable is used to keep track of the number of elements that need to be added to `b` to maintain the lexicographically largest order. This is a crucial part of the logic to ensure that the elements are added in the correct order.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - After processing all unique elements, the program adds the remaining elements to `b` by decrementing the last element of `b` until all elements are added. This ensures that the array `b` is lexicographically largest.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Step 1**: Reading the input and handling multiple test cases is correctly implemented.
- **Step 2**: Modifying the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element is correct.
- **Step 3**: Using a `Counter` to count occurrences and converting `a` to a set to remove duplicates is correct. Sorting the set in descending order is also correct.
- **Step 4**: The logic for constructing the array `b` is complex but follows the correct approach to ensure the lexicographically largest order. The program tries to add the largest possible elements that are not already in `b` and are less than the current element.
- **Step 5**: Handling the remaining elements by decrementing the last element of `b` is correct.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program should handle edge cases where all elements in `a` are the same. In such cases, the set `a` will have only one unique element, and the program should correctly handle the construction of `b`. The current implementation does handle this correctly by adding the necessary elements to ensure the lexicographically largest order.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints given (up to `3 * 10^5` elements in total across all test cases).

### Annotated Code Validation:

- **State Before Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called for each test case. The function definition is correct as it matches the problem description.
- **State After Modifying `a`**: The array `a` is correctly modified by adding `i + 1` to each element.
- **State After Converting to Set and Sorting**: The array `a` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then sorted in descending order. This is correct.
- **State After Constructing `b`**: The array `b` is constructed correctly by adding the largest possible elements that are not already in `b` and are less than the current element. The `cur` variable is used to keep track of the number of elements that need to be added.
- **State After Handling Remaining Elements**: The remaining elements are added to `b` by decrementing the last element of `b` until all elements are added. This ensures that the array `b` is lexicographically largest.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly follow the problem description and handles the construction of the lexicographically largest array `b` as required. The annotations and the original assessment are consistent and accurate. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
