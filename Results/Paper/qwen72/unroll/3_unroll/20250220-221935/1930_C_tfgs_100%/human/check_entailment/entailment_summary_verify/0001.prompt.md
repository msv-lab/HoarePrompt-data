You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        cur += counter[a[i]]
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the standard input. After processing, it prints a list of integers `ans` where each element of `a` is incremented by its index plus one, and additional elements are added to ensure the difference between consecutive elements in `ans` is at least 2. The final state of the program includes `a` being a sorted list of unique elements (in descending order), `counter` having all counts reduced to 0, and `cnt` being 0. The variables `t` and `test_cases` are not used or modified by the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`**:
   - The program modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`. This step is correct as it follows the problem description where each element `a_i` is modified to `a_i + i + 1`.

3. **Counting Unique Elements**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element in `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts the set in descending order.

4. **Constructing the Array `b`**:
   - The program initializes `cnt` to the number of elements in `a` that are not unique (i.e., `n - len(a)`).
   - It iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a` and constructs the array `b` by adding the largest possible elements that are not already in `b` and are less than the current element.
   - It uses a `cur` variable to keep track of the number of elements that need to be added to `b` to maintain the lexicographically largest order.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - After processing all unique elements, the program adds the remaining elements to `b` by decrementing the last element of `b` until all elements are added.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Step 1**: Reading the input and handling multiple test cases is correctly implemented.
- **Step 2**: Modifying the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element is correct.
- **Step 3**: Using a `Counter` to count occurrences and converting `a` to a set to remove duplicates is correct. Sorting the set in descending order is also correct.
- **Step 4**: The logic for constructing the array `b` is complex but follows the correct approach to ensure the lexicographically largest order. The program tries to add the largest possible elements that are not already in `b` and are less than the current element.
- **Step 5**: Handling the remaining elements by decrementing the last element of `b` is correct.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program should handle edge cases where all elements in `a` are the same. In such cases, the set `a` will have only one unique element, and the program should correctly handle the construction of `b`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints given (up to `3 * 10^5` elements in total across all test cases).

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly follow the problem description and handles the construction of the lexicographically largest array `b` as required. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
