The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings based on spaces, converts each string into an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. `a` is a list of integers read from input.**
