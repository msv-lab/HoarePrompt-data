### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` and an empty set `S`.
   - We perform `n` operations where in each operation, we:
     - Select an index `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ |a|).
     - Insert `a[i] + i` into `S`.
     - Delete `a[i]` from `a`.
   - After `n` operations, `a` will be empty.
   - We need to construct a new array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order.
   - The goal is to find the lexicographically largest `b`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case using the function `func_1`.
   - In `func_1`:
     - It reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
     - It increments each element of `a` by its index plus one.
     - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the modified `a`.
     - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts it in descending order.
     - It initializes `cnt` to the difference between `n` and the length of the unique elements in `a`.
     - It constructs the array `ans` by:
       - Adding elements from `a` to `ans`.
       - Adding additional elements to ensure the difference between consecutive elements in `ans` is at least 2.
     - Finally, it prints the array `ans`.

3. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - **Incrementing Elements:** The program correctly increments each element of `a` by its index plus one.
   - **Removing Duplicates:** The program correctly removes duplicates by converting `a` to a set.
   - **Sorting in Descending Order:** The program sorts the unique elements in descending order.
   - **Handling Duplicates:** The program ensures that the difference between consecutive elements in `ans` is at least 2 by adding additional elements.
   - **Output:** The program prints the lexicographically largest array `b`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where the same value is inserted into `S` multiple times due to the same `a[i] + i` value. However, the use of `Counter` and the logic to add additional elements ensures that the final array `ans` is lexicographically largest.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem and produce the lexicographically largest array `b`.

**Correctness: True**
