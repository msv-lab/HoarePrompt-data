The function `func_1` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the standard input. After processing, it prints a list of integers `ans` where each element of `a` is incremented by its index plus one, and additional elements are added to ensure the difference between consecutive elements in `ans` is at least 2. The final state of the program includes `a` being a sorted list of unique elements (in descending order), `counter` having all counts reduced to 0, and `cnt` being 0. The variables `t` and `test_cases` are not used or modified by the function.
