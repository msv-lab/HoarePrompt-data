To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range(n)` function, so it will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration. The other variables and conditions provided in the state before the loop (such as `t`, `test_cases`, and `a`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they provide context for the value of `n`.

Given the state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
- 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
