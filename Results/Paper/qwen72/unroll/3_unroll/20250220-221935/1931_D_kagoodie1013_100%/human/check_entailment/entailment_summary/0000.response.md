Reasoning:  
The program is designed to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array for each test case. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices \((i, j)\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and the conditions \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\) are met.

The function `func_1` processes each test case as follows:
1. It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
2. It creates a dictionary `residue_map` to store the counts of pairs of residues \((r_x, r_y)\) where \(r_x = -a_i \mod x\) and \(r_y = a_i \mod y\).
3. For each number `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates the residues \(r_x\) and \(r_y\).
4. It checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) already exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of such pairs to `count`.
5. It then updates the `residue_map` with the current key \((num \mod x, num \mod y)\).

However, there is a subtle issue in the calculation of \(r_x\). The correct calculation for \(r_x\) should be \((x - num \mod x) \mod x\) to ensure that the residue is non-negative and correctly represents the condition for divisibility by \(x\). The current implementation uses `-num % x`, which can result in negative residues, leading to incorrect counts.

Given this, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the residues for the condition \(a_i + a_j\) being divisible by \(x\).

Correctness: **False**
