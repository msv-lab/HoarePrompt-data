Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then parses the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by extracting `n`, `x`, and `y` followed by the array `arr`.

2. **Test Case Storage**: The program stores each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in the list `test_cases`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues of the array elements.
   - It then iterates over each element `num` in the array `arr`.
   - For each element, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
     - `r_x = -num % x` ensures that the sum `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` ensures that the difference `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` is already in the `residue_map` and adds the count of such pairs to `count`.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current key `(num % x, num % y)`.

4. **Output**: The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them.

5. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the residues is correct. For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) must be divisible by `x`, which is checked by `r_x = -num % x`.
     - \(a_i - a_j\) must be divisible by `y`, which is checked by `r_y = num % y`.
   - The use of the `residue_map` to count pairs is efficient and correct. It ensures that for each element `num`, we can quickly find how many previous elements form a beautiful pair with `num`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, including the large input sizes and the range of values for `x` and `y`.
   - It correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results for each.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should handle the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
