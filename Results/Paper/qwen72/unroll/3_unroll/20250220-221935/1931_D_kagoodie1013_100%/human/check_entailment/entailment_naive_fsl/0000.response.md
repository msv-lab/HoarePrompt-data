Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the array contains duplicate elements that can form beautiful pairs with themselves. According to the problem description, a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if \(1 \le i < j \le n\). However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not ensure that \(i < j\), and it can count pairs where \(i = j\), leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 2 1
1 1 1
```
The expected output is 0 because there are no pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(1 \le i < j \le 3\) and both conditions are satisfied. However, the current implementation will count the pair \(\langle 1, 1 \rangle\) (which is invalid) and return an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should ensure that it only counts pairs where \(i < j\).
