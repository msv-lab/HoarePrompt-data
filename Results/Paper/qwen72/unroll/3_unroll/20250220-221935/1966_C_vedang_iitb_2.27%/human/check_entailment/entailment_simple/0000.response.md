### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a positive integer \( k \) of stones from each nonempty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and both players play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a list of positive integers `a` and returns a new list `a_new` where each element (except the first one) is the difference between the original element and the previous element in the sorted unique list `a_temp`.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the list of pile sizes into a form that can be more easily analyzed for the game's outcome.
   - The transformation ensures that the first element remains the same, and subsequent elements represent the "gap" between consecutive unique pile sizes.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list `a` and the number of unique pile sizes `n`.
   - If there is only one unique pile size (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can remove all stones in that pile on her first turn.
   - If there are two unique pile sizes (`n == 2`), the game's outcome depends on whether the smallest pile size is even or odd:
     - If the smallest pile size is even, Alice can always win by removing an even number of stones, leaving Bob with an odd number of stones in the larger pile.
     - If the smallest pile size is odd, Bob can always win because Alice will be forced to leave an even number of stones in the larger pile.
   - For more than two unique pile sizes (`n > 2`), the function recursively determines the winner by considering the subgame where the smallest pile is removed and the remaining piles are analyzed.

4. **Recursive Logic:**
   - The function `func_2` uses a recursive approach to determine the winner.
   - It checks if the subgame (after removing the smallest pile) results in a win for the next player (`winNext`).
   - If the subgame results in a win for the next player and the smallest pile size is not 1, or if the subgame results in a loss for the next player, Alice wins.
   - Otherwise, Bob wins.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as a single pile or two piles correctly.
   - The transformation in `func_1` ensures that the list is processed in a way that simplifies the recursive analysis in `func_2`.

6. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly transforms the input list and uses a recursive function to determine the winner based on the transformed list.
   - The logic in `func_2` is consistent with the optimal play strategy for the game.
