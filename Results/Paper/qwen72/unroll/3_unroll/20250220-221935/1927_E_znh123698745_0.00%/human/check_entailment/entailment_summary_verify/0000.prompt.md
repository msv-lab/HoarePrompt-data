You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two parameters `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates and prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` in a specific alternating pattern. The pattern alternates between taking elements from the end and the beginning of the sequence, starting with the first element. After processing all test cases, the function will have printed the results for each test case, and the internal variables used in the function will be in the state corresponding to the last test case processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly construct a k-level permutation for every potential case. Specifically, the logic for constructing the permutation is flawed. The permutation is built by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements, but this does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

For example, consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 2`. The expected output should be a permutation where the sums of all continuous segments of length 2 differ by no more than 1. However, the program generates the permutation `[1, 4, 2, 3]`. The sums of the continuous segments are:
- `1 + 4 = 5`
- `4 + 2 = 6`
- `2 + 3 = 5`

Here, the maximum sum is 6 and the minimum sum is 5, which satisfies the condition. However, for a different input, such as `n = 5` and `k = 2`, the program generates the permutation `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`. The sums of the continuous segments are:
- `1 + 5 = 6`
- `5 + 2 = 7`
- `2 + 4 = 6`
- `4 + 3 = 7`

In this case, the maximum sum is 7 and the minimum sum is 6, which also satisfies the condition. However, for `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the program generates the permutation `[1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 5, 6]`. The sums of the continuous segments are:
- `1 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 22`
- `10 + 2 + 9 + 3 = 24`
- `2 + 9 + 3 + 8 = 22`
- `9 + 3 + 8 + 4 = 24`
- `3 + 8 + 4 + 7 = 22`
- `8 + 4 + 7 + 5 = 24`
- `4 + 7 + 5 + 6 = 22`

Here, the maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 22, which satisfies the condition. However, for `n = 13` and `k = 4`, the program generates the permutation `[1, 13, 2, 12, 3, 11, 4, 10, 5, 9, 6, 8, 7]`. The sums of the continuous segments are:
- `1 + 13 + 2 + 12 = 28`
- `13 + 2 + 12 + 3 = 30`
- `2 + 12 + 3 + 11 = 28`
- `12 + 3 + 11 + 4 = 30`
- `3 + 11 + 4 + 10 = 28`
- `11 + 4 + 10 + 5 = 30`
- `4 + 10 + 5 + 9 = 28`
- `10 + 5 + 9 + 6 = 30`
- `5 + 9 + 6 + 8 = 28`
- `9 + 6 + 8 + 7 = 30`

In this case, the maximum sum is 30 and the minimum sum is 28, which satisfies the condition. However, the logic used to construct the permutation is not guaranteed to work for all possible values of `n` and `k`. For instance, consider `n = 6` and `k = 4`. The program generates the permutation `[1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]`. The sums of the continuous segments are:
- `1 + 6 + 2 + 5 = 14`
- `6 + 2 + 5 + 3 = 16`
- `2 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 14`

Here, the maximum sum is 16 and the minimum sum is 14, which satisfies the condition. However, the logic is not consistent and does not guarantee that the condition will be met for all inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
