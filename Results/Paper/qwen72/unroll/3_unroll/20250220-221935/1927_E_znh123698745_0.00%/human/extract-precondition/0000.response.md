Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), which is not explicitly passed as a parameter but is part of the input context.**
