The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop can execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be at least 1. The variable `t` (number of test cases) is not directly part of the loop head but is implied by the input. Therefore, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0**
