### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation of length \( n \) such that the sums of all continuous segments of length \( k \) differ by no more than 1.
   - \( k \) is even, and \( 2 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It initializes an array `array` with the integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It initializes `answer` with the first element of the permutation as 1.
   - It initializes `a` with two indices: 1 and -1, which will be used to alternate between the start and end of the `array`.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program uses a loop to construct the permutation.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - For each iteration, it checks if \( (-1)^i \) is -1. If true, it appends the element at the end of the `array` (using `a[-1]`) and decrements `a[-1]`.
   - If false, it appends the element at the start of the `array` (using `a[0]`) and increments `a[0]`.

4. **Ensuring the k-level Property:**
   - The key idea is to alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements in the `array`.
   - This ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) are balanced.
   - For example, if \( k = 4 \), the sums of segments like `[1, 8, 4, 10]` and `[8, 4, 10, 2]` will be close to each other because the elements are alternated between small and large values.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed permutation for each test case.

6. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the program with the provided example:
     - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `2 1`. The sums are \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) and \( 1 + 2 = 3 \). The difference is 0, which is \(\le 1\).
     - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `1 3 2`. The sums are \( 1 + 3 = 4 \) and \( 3 + 2 = 5 \). The difference is 1, which is \(\le 1\).
     - For \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 4 \), the output is `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`. The sums of segments are:
       - \( 1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23 \)
       - \( 8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24 \)
       - \( 4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23 \)
       - \( 10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24 \)
       - \( 2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23 \)
       - \( 7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24 \)
       - \( 5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23 \)
     - The maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 23, so the difference is 1, which is \(\le 1\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a k-level permutation for the given constraints and examples. The alternating approach ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) are balanced, satisfying the condition that any two sums differ by no more than 1.

Correctness: **True**
