The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string `s`. The loop will iterate over the reversed string `s[::-1]`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character. The state of `j` will be the last character of `s` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` (or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found), `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` (or 0 if 'B' is not found), `m` is the input integer, `s` is the input string that must have at least one character, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the last character of `s`**
