The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop is controlled by the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. Since the state before the loop specifies that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, we can assume that `int(input())` will return `t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0**
