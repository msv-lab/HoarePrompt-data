You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, k, x, and a are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.

    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
        
        if x < k - 1:

            else:

            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, but the loop has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from standard input, where the first line specifies the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9). The function then evaluates a set of conditions based on these integers and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged after the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place a bet of \( y \) coins.
   - If he wins, his coins increase by \( y \cdot (k - 1) \).
   - If he loses, his coins decrease by \( y \).
   - He cannot lose more than \( x \) times in a row.
   - Initially, Sasha has \( a \) coins.
   - We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee to have at least \( n \) coins for any integer \( n \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If \( x \) is less than \( k - 1 \), Sasha can always recover from \( x \) consecutive losses because the next win will always bring his total back to a positive value.
   - If \( x \) is equal to \( k - 1 \), Sasha can recover from \( x \) consecutive losses, but he needs to have at least \( x + 2 \) coins initially to ensure he can place the next bet after \( x \) losses.
   - If \( x \) is greater than \( k - 1 \), Sasha needs to calculate the minimum number of coins required to guarantee he can recover from \( x \) consecutive losses and still place the next bet.

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It splits the input line into three integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).
   - It then checks the following conditions:
     - If \( x < k - 1 \):
       - If \( a \geq x + 1 \), print "YES".
       - Otherwise, print "NO".
     - If \( x == k - 1 \):
       - If \( a \geq x + 2 \), print "YES".
       - Otherwise, print "NO".
     - If \( x > k - 1 \):
       - It calculates \( z \) starting from \( k - 2 \).
       - It iteratively increases \( z \) by \( z // (k - 1) + 1 \) for \( x - k + 3 \) times.
       - If \( a \geq z \), print "YES".
       - Otherwise, print "NO".

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - For \( x < k - 1 \), the program correctly checks if Sasha has at least \( x + 1 \) coins. This is because after \( x \) consecutive losses, he can still place a bet and recover.
   - For \( x == k - 1 \), the program correctly checks if Sasha has at least \( x + 2 \) coins. This is because after \( x \) consecutive losses, he needs one more coin to place the next bet.
   - For \( x > k - 1 \), the program calculates \( z \) to determine the minimum number of coins required. The calculation \( z = k - 2 \) and the iterative increase \( z += z // (k - 1) + 1 \) for \( x - k + 3 \) times is intended to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses \( x \) times in a row and then wins. However, this calculation is not entirely correct. The correct approach should be to calculate the total number of coins lost after \( x \) consecutive losses and then check if Sasha can recover from this loss.

5. **Correct Calculation for \( x > k - 1 \):**
   - The total number of coins lost after \( x \) consecutive losses is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + x \).
   - This sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first \( x \) natural numbers: \( \text{sum} = \frac{x \cdot (x + 1)}{2} \).
   - After \( x \) consecutive losses, Sasha needs to have at least \( \frac{x \cdot (x + 1)}{2} + 1 \) coins to place the next bet and recover.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** for the case \( x > k - 1 \) because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins required to guarantee recovery from \( x \) consecutive losses.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            # Calculate the total number of coins lost after x consecutive losses
            total_loss = (x * (x + 1)) // 2
            if a >= total_loss + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
