### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `x` and the list of best friends `l`.

2. **Logic for Determining Minimum Invitations:**
   - The function iterates through the list `l` to check if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.
   - The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is intended to check if the best friend of the `i`-th friend is the `i`-th friend themselves, which is not possible since `p_i \ne i` and all `p_i` are distinct.
   - However, the correct condition to check for a pair of friends who are each other's best friends should be `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`.

3. **Analysis of the Logic:**
   - The current condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is incorrect and will never be true because it checks if the best friend of the `i`-th friend is the `i`-th friend themselves, which is not possible.
   - The correct condition to check for a pair of friends who are each other's best friends is `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`.
   - If such a pair is found, Monocarp can send invitations to just these two friends, and they will both come to the party.
   - If no such pair is found, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **Correct Condition:**
   - The correct condition to check for a pair of friends who are each other's best friends is `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`.
   - The current condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is incorrect and will never be true.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it uses the wrong condition to check for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. The correct condition should be `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
