Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
   - The function returns the minimum value between `pairs` and `n // 2`. This is because you can only score points for pairs, and you can only play `n // 2` turns (since you play `n` cards in `2n` turns, and you play one card per turn in your `n` turns).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from `stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of integers in your hand.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The problem states that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by considering the pairs in your hand.
   - Since Nene will always play optimally, the function `func_1` ensures that you only count the pairs that you can play before Nene can play the same card, which is the correct approach.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n` and the list `a`.
   - The output is correctly printed for each test case after calling `func_1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where `n` is 1 or the list `a` contains all unique integers or all pairs correctly.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where there are no pairs in your hand, returning 0.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
