Output State: **The function `func_2` is now set up to read input from `stdin` using the `input` variable, which is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` method. `data` is a list of strings, each element being a part of the input split by whitespace. `idx` is 0. No other variables are affected, and the function is ready to process input and call `func_1` for each test case.**
