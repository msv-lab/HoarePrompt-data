Reasoning:

### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Correctness**: The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand. The number of pairs of cards you have is calculated by summing up the instances where a card appears exactly twice. The function then returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.
- **Explanation**:
  - **Counting Pairs**: The `Counter` correctly counts the occurrences of each card. The `sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2)` correctly calculates the number of pairs of cards in your hand.
  - **Optimal Play**: The game rules state that you and Nene take turns, and Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The key insight is that you can only score a point if Nene has already placed a card with the same number on the table. Since Nene plays optimally, she will always place a card that you do not have a pair for, unless she has no other choice. Therefore, the maximum number of points you can get is the number of pairs you have, but no more than `n // 2` because you only have `n` cards and you take `n` turns.
  - **Edge Cases**: The function handles all edge cases correctly. For example, if you have no pairs (`pairs = 0`), the function returns 0, which is correct. If you have more pairs than `n // 2`, the function returns `n // 2`, which is also correct.

### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Correctness**: The function `func_2` reads the input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It correctly parses the input and stores the results, printing them at the end.
- **Explanation**:
  - **Input Parsing**: The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over the test cases, correctly extracting the values of `n` and the list `a` for each test case.
  - **Calling `func_1`**: For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and appends the result to the `results` list.
  - **Output**: After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list. This is the correct way to handle multiple test cases and output the results.

### Overall Program:
- **Correctness**: The program as a whole correctly handles the problem description. It processes multiple test cases, calculates the maximum number of points you can get for each test case, and outputs the results.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases, including the smallest and largest possible values of `n` and the distribution of cards.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
