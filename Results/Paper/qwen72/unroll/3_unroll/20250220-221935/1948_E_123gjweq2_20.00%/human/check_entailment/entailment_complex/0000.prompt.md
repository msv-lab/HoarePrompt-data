Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n, `cliques` is the ceiling of `n / k`, `arr` is a list of `n` elements where the first `k` elements are 1, the next `k` elements are 2, and so on, up to the last segment which is set to `cliques`, `cliquess` is a list of `n` zeros.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: 1 1 ... [cliques] [cliques] [cliques] (where the first k elements are 1, the next k elements are 2, and so on, up to the last segment which is set to cliques, and cliques is the ceiling of n / k)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques (where cliques is the ceiling of \(n / k\))
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: - The output will be a sequence of `n` zeros separated by spaces.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k`. The function initializes a list `arr` of length `n` with all elements set to 0. It then assigns a value to each segment of `arr` such that the first `k` elements are set to 1, the next `k` elements are set to 2, and so on, up to the last segment which is set to the calculated number of cliques. The function prints the elements of `arr` separated by spaces, followed by the number of cliques, and finally a sequence of `n` zeros separated by spaces. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are non-negative integers such that left <= right, and clique is a positive integer.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: `left` and `right` remain non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` remains a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`. The elements in `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`, and the elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to `clique`.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: The elements in `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`, and the elements in `arr` from index `left + mid` to `right` are set to values from `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`. The elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `right` are all set to `clique`. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` ≤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. The function modifies two external arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, such that the elements in `arr` from index `left` to `right` are set to a sequence of values starting from `left + 1` and increasing to `left + mid` (where `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`), followed by a sequence of values starting from `right + 1` and decreasing to `right + 1 - (right - left + 1 - mid)`. The elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `right` are all set to the value of `clique`. The function does not return any value.
