### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires assigning distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
   - An edge is added between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the partition.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - `arr` is used to store the assigned values to the vertices.
   - `cliquess` is used to store the clique assignments for each vertex.
   - The `make_array` function is responsible for assigning values to the vertices and their corresponding cliques.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
   - It iterates over the range of `cliques` and calls `make_array` for each clique.

4. **Function `make_array`**:
   - It takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - `small_element` is set to `left + 1`.
   - `big_element` is set to `right + 1`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the number of elements to be assigned from the smaller side.
   - `not_mid` is the number of elements to be assigned from the larger side.
   - It assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` in two loops:
     - The first loop assigns values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` to the vertices from `left` to `left + mid - 1`.
     - The second loop assigns values from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element` to the vertices from `left + mid` to `right`.

5. **Edge Condition**:
   - The edge condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) is implicitly handled by the way `make_array` assigns values. The function ensures that the difference in indices and values is minimized within each clique, which should satisfy the edge condition.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments for each vertex.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(k = 3\), the program should output a single clique with both vertices assigned values 2 and 1.
   - For \(n = 5\) and \(k = 4\), the program should output two cliques with vertices assigned values in a way that satisfies the edge condition.
   - For \(n = 8\) and \(k = 16\), the program should output a single clique with all vertices assigned values from 1 to 8.

8. **Verification**:
   - The program seems to correctly handle the assignment of values and cliques.
   - The number of cliques is calculated correctly using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The assignment of values and cliques within each clique should ensure that the edge condition is met.

### Issues Identified:
- **Global Variable Usage**:
  - The function `make_array` modifies the global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. This can lead to unexpected behavior if these variables are not properly reset or managed between test cases.
  - To ensure correctness, `arr` and `cliquess` should be passed as arguments to `make_array` or reinitialized within `func_1` for each test case.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1, arr, cliquess)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

def make_array(left, right, clique, arr, cliquess):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique

# Example usage
t = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().strip().split())
    func_1(n, k)
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was accurate in its reasoning and conclusion that the program correctly solves the problem.
- However, the program has a potential issue with the use of global variables, which can lead to incorrect behavior if not managed properly.
- The corrected program addresses this issue by passing `arr` and `cliquess` as arguments to `make_array`.

Final: **True** (with the noted correction)
