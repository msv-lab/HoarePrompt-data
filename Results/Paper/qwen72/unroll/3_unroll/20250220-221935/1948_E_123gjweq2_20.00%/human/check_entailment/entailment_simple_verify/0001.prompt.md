You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
   - We need to create a graph where an edge is added between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the partition.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - `arr` is used to store the assigned values to the vertices.
   - `cliquess` is used to store the clique assignments for each vertex.
   - The `make_array` function is responsible for assigning values to the vertices and their corresponding cliques.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
   - It iterates over the range of `cliques` and calls `make_array` for each clique.

4. **Function `make_array`**:
   - It takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - `small_element` is set to `left + 1`.
   - `big_element` is set to `right + 1`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the number of elements to be assigned from the smaller side.
   - `not_mid` is the number of elements to be assigned from the larger side.
   - It assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` in two loops:
     - The first loop assigns values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` to the vertices from `left` to `left + mid - 1`.
     - The second loop assigns values from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element` to the vertices from `left + mid` to `right`.

5. **Edge Condition**:
   - The edge condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) is implicitly handled by the way `make_array` assigns values. The function ensures that the difference in indices and values is minimized within each clique, which should satisfy the edge condition.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments for each vertex.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(k = 3\), the program should output a single clique with both vertices assigned values 2 and 1.
   - For \(n = 5\) and \(k = 4\), the program should output two cliques with vertices assigned values in a way that satisfies the edge condition.
   - For \(n = 8\) and \(k = 16\), the program should output a single clique with all vertices assigned values from 1 to 8.

8. **Verification**:
   - The program seems to correctly handle the assignment of values and cliques.
   - The number of cliques is calculated correctly using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The assignment of values and cliques within each clique should ensure that the edge condition is met.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It assigns values to vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques while ensuring the edge condition is satisfied.
