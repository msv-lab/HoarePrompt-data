The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k`. The function initializes a list `arr` of length `n` with all elements set to 0. It then assigns a value to each segment of `arr` such that the first `k` elements are set to 1, the next `k` elements are set to 2, and so on, up to the last segment which is set to the calculated number of cliques. The function prints the elements of `arr` separated by spaces, followed by the number of cliques, and finally a sequence of `n` zeros separated by spaces. The function does not return any value.
