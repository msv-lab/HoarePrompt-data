Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `mid` is calculated as `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, which simplifies to `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2` and further simplifies to `(right - left) // 2`. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged.
