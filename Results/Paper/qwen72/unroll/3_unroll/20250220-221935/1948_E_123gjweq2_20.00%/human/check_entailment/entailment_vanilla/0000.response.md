### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
   - We need to create a graph where an edge is added between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the partition.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - `arr` is used to store the assigned values to the vertices.
   - `cliquess` is used to store the clique assignments for each vertex.
   - The `make_array` function is responsible for assigning values to the vertices and their corresponding cliques.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
   - It iterates over the range of `cliques` and calls `make_array` for each clique.

4. **Function `make_array`**:
   - It takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - `small_element` is set to `left + 1`.
   - `big_element` is set to `right + 1`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the number of elements to be assigned from the smaller side.
   - `not_mid` is the number of elements to be assigned from the larger side.
   - It assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` in two loops:
     - The first loop assigns values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` to the vertices from `left` to `left + mid - 1`.
     - The second loop assigns values from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element` to the vertices from `left + mid` to `right`.

5. **Edge Condition**:
   - The edge condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) is implicitly handled by the way `make_array` assigns values. The function ensures that the difference in indices and values is minimized within each clique, which should satisfy the edge condition.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments for each vertex.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(k = 3\), the program should output a single clique with both vertices assigned values 2 and 1.
   - For \(n = 5\) and \(k = 4\), the program should output two cliques with vertices assigned values in a way that satisfies the edge condition.
   - For \(n = 8\) and \(k = 16\), the program should output a single clique with all vertices assigned values from 1 to 8.

8. **Verification**:
   - The program seems to correctly handle the assignment of values and cliques.
   - The number of cliques is calculated correctly using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The assignment of values and cliques within each clique should ensure that the edge condition is met.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It assigns values to vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques while ensuring the edge condition is satisfied.

Correctness: **True**
