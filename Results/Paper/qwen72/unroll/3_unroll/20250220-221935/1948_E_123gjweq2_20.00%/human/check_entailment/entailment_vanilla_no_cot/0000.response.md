Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Function Call in `func_1`:**
   - The function `make_array` is called with parameters `i * k` and `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)`, but `make_array` is defined to take three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. The function call is missing the `clique` parameter.

2. **Global Variables:**
   - The variables `arr` and `cliquess` are defined inside `func_1` but are used as global variables in `make_array`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and is generally a bad practice. It would be better to pass these arrays as arguments to `make_array`.

3. **Clique Calculation:**
   - The calculation of the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)` is incorrect. The number of cliques should be based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k`. The current approach does not guarantee that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

4. **Assignment of Values:**
   - The way values are assigned to `arr` and `cliquess` in `make_array` does not ensure that the graph will be partitioned correctly. The logic for assigning values to `arr` and `cliquess` should be more carefully designed to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Corrected Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that the values assigned to the vertices and the partitioning into cliques satisfy the given condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def solve(n, k):
    # Step 1: Assign values to vertices
    arr = list(range(1, n + 1))
    
    # Step 2: Determine the number of cliques
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    
    # Step 3: Assign each vertex to a clique
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        cliquess[i] = (i // k) + 1
    
    # Step 4: Print the results
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

# Read input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    solve(n, k)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Assign Values to Vertices:**
   - We assign the values from 1 to n to the vertices in a straightforward manner.

2. **Determine the Number of Cliques:**
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`. This is a reasonable starting point, but it may need to be adjusted based on the specific condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k`.

3. **Assign Each Vertex to a Clique:**
   - Each vertex is assigned to a clique based on its index. Specifically, vertex `i` is assigned to clique `(i // k) + 1`.

4. **Print the Results:**
   - The values assigned to the vertices, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments are printed.

This approach ensures that the vertices are assigned values and partitioned into cliques in a way that satisfies the given condition. However, it may not always produce the minimum number of cliques, especially for larger values of `k`. A more sophisticated algorithm might be needed to ensure the minimum number of cliques in all cases.
