Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` from the array `a` such that for each `i`, `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The provided program attempts to solve this by maintaining a list `mex` that will eventually be the permutation `p`, and two variables `minn` and `maxx` to track the current MEX and the maximum value in the permutation, respectively.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, representing the smallest integer that has not yet been used in the permutation.
   - `maxx` is initialized to 0, representing the largest integer used in the permutation.

2. **Loop through the array `arr`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it means that the MEX of the current prefix of `p` is greater than `p_i`. Therefore, the smallest unused integer (`minn`) is added to `mex`, and `minn` is incremented.
     - If `arr[i]` is negative, it means that the MEX of the current prefix of `p` is less than or equal to `p_i`. The value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is added to `mex`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum value in `mex`.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the `mex` list, it is printed as the permutation `p`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Handling of `minn` and `maxx`**:
  - The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` is not entirely correct. Specifically, the condition `if minn == maxx` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect updates of `minn`.
  - The value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is not always the correct value to add to `mex` when `arr[i]` is negative. The correct value should be `mex[i] = minn + arr[i]`.

- **Constructing the permutation**:
  - The permutation `p` should be constructed such that the MEX condition is satisfied. The current logic does not always ensure this.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    used = set()
    minn = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            # If arr[i] is positive, the MEX is the smallest unused integer
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
            mex.append(minn)
            used.add(minn)
            minn += 1
        else:
            # If arr[i] is negative, the MEX is less than or equal to p_i
            p_i = minn + arr[i]
            mex.append(p_i)
            used.add(p_i)
            minn = p_i + 1

    # Print the constructed permutation
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()
```

**Explanation of the corrected version**:
- **Tracking used integers**: A set `used` is maintained to keep track of the integers that have already been used in the permutation.
- **Updating `minn`**: `minn` is updated to the smallest integer that has not been used yet.
- **Handling positive and negative elements**:
  - For positive elements, the smallest unused integer is added to `mex`.
  - For negative elements, the value `minn + arr[i]` is added to `mex`, and `minn` is updated accordingly.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
