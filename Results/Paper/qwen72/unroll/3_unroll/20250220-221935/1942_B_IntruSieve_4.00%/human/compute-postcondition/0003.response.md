Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`, and an array `a` of length `n` with elements in the range -n to n (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for each test case. `n` is now an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. `mex` is an empty list. `minn` is 0.**

The variable `minn` is set to 0, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the initial state remains the same except for the assignment of `minn`.
