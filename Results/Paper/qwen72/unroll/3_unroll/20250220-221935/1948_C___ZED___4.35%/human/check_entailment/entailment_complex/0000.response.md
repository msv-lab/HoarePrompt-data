### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Second-to-Last Arrow in `b`:**
   - The function first checks if the second-to-last character in the string `b` (i.e., `b[-2]`) is not '>'. If it is not, the robot cannot reach the last cell in the second row, so the function prints 'NO' and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is correct because the robot must end up in the last cell of the second row, and if the second-to-last cell in `b` does not point to the right, the robot cannot move to the last cell.

2. **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The function then checks if `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, the function prints 'YES' because the robot starts at (1, 1) and the only cell in the second row is (2, 1), which is the target cell.
   - However, the problem states that `n` is always at least 2, so this check is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

3. **Checking for Path in Even-Indexed Cells of `b`:**
   - The function iterates through the even-indexed cells of `b` (i.e., `b[0], b[2], b[4], ...`) and checks if any of them are not '>'. If any even-indexed cell in `b` is not '>', the variable `no_path` is set to `False`.
   - This check is intended to ensure that the robot can move from the first row to the second row at some point. However, it is not sufficient to guarantee that the robot can reach the last cell in the second row.

4. **Checking for Path in Odd-Indexed Cells of `a`:**
   - If the previous check did not find a valid path, the function then iterates through the odd-indexed cells of `a` (i.e., `a[1], a[3], a[5], ...`) and checks if any of them are not '>'. If any odd-indexed cell in `a` is not '>', the variable `no_path` is set to `False`.
   - This check is intended to ensure that the robot can move from the second row back to the first row at some point. However, it is not sufficient to guarantee that the robot can reach the last cell in the second row.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after both checks, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - The final decision is based on the assumption that if there is no path in the even-indexed cells of `b` and no path in the odd-indexed cells of `a`, the robot cannot reach the last cell in the second row. However, this assumption is incorrect because it does not consider the combined effect of the arrows in both rows.

### Issues:
- The function does not correctly handle the combined effect of the arrows in both rows. The robot can move between rows and columns, and the function should check if there is a valid sequence of moves that allows the robot to reach the last cell in the second row.
- The special case for `n == 1` is unnecessary and incorrect because `n` is always at least 2.

### Correctness:
**False**

The function does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) in all cases. It only checks for the presence of certain arrows in even and odd indexed cells, which is not sufficient to ensure the robot can reach the target cell. A more comprehensive approach is needed to simulate the robot's movements and check if it can reach the target.
