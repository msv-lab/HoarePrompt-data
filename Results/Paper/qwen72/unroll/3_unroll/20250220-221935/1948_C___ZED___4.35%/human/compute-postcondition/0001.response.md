Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated for each test case, but their final values after the loop are not retained as they are reinitialized for each iteration. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5, and the loop completes all `t` iterations.**
