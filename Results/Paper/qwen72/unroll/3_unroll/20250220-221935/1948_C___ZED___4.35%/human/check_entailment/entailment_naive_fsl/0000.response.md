Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly prints 'YES' for the case where `n == 1`, which is not allowed according to the problem constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). Additionally, the logic for determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
4
><><
><><
```

The correct output should be 'NO' because the robot cannot reach cell (2, 4) from (1, 1) following the rules. However, the program prints 'YES'. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle all cases.
