Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value. The logic for constructing the word is flawed, particularly in how it handles the distribution of the remaining value `lex` among the three letters.

Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Value**:
   - The program subtracts 1 or 26 from `lex` without ensuring that the remaining value is correctly distributed among the three letters.
   - For example, if `lex` is 24, the program will append 1, 1, and 22 to the array, which results in "aav". However, the correct lexicographically smallest word for 24 is "cat".

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array after appending the values does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. The order of the letters is important, and sorting can change the order in a way that does not produce the correct result.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the remaining value `lex` is less than 26 correctly. For example, if `lex` is 3, the program will append 1, 1, and 1, which results in "aaa", but it should handle the case where the remaining value is less than 26 more carefully.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the array to store the three letters
        arr = [0, 0, 0]
        
        # Distribute the value among the three letters
        for j in range(3):
            if lex > 26:
                arr[j] = 26
                lex -= 26
            else:
                arr[j] = lex
                lex = 0
        
        # Ensure the array is in lexicographically smallest order
        arr.sort()
        
        # Print the result
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()  # Move to the next line for the next test case

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the value is distributed correctly among the three letters and then sorts the array to produce the lexicographically smallest word.
