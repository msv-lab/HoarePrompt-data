The function reads an integer `cases` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `lex` (3 ≤ lex ≤ 78) representing the encoded value of a three-letter word. It then decodes this value into a three-character string, where each character is determined by the sorted values in an array `arr` plus 96. The function prints the decoded three-character string for each test case. The function does not return any value.
