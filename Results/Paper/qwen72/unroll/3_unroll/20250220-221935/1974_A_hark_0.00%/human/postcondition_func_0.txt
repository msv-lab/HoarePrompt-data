The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are values of any type that support comparison, and returns the smaller of the two values. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `a`; otherwise, it returns `b`. After the function concludes, the program has the smaller value between `a` and `b` available for further use.
