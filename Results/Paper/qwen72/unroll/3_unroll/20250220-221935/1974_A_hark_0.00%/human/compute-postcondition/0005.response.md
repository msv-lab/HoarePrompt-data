Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 99\).
   - `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 < y \leq 99\).
   - `bxsfory` is equal to `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `bxsfory` is calculated as the ceiling of \(y / 2\). This means it is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(y / 2\).
   - `bxsfory1` is calculated based on the value of `x`:
     - If \(x \leq 0\), `bxsfory1` is 0.
     - If \(x > 0\), `bxsfory1` is \(\text{math.ceil}(x / 15) + 1\).

3. **Calculating the Values:**
   - For `bxsfory`, since \(0 < y \leq 99\), the value of `bxsfory` will be an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). This is because the ceiling of \(y / 2\) for \(y\) in the range 1 to 99 will be between 1 and 50.
   - For `bxsfory1`, the value depends on `x`:
     - If \(x = 0\), `bxsfory1` is 0.
     - If \(x > 0\), `bxsfory1` is \(\text{math.ceil}(x / 15) + 1\). The value of \(\text{math.ceil}(x / 15)\) will be an integer between 1 and 7 (inclusive) because \(x\) ranges from 1 to 99. Adding 1 to this value will give a range of 2 to 8 (inclusive).

4. **Summing the Values:**
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.
   - If \(x = 0\), `bxsfory1` is 0, so the output will be `bxsfory` which is between 1 and 50.
   - If \(x > 0\), `bxsfory1` is between 2 and 8, and `bxsfory` is between 1 and 50. Therefore, the sum `bxsfory1 + bxsfory` will be between 3 and 58 (inclusive).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact value of the sum will depend on the specific values of `x` and `y`, but we can describe the range of possible values.

Output: **[3 to 58] (where the value is the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`, with `bxsfory1` being 0 if `x` is 0, otherwise `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`, and `bxsfory` being `math.ceil(y / 2)`)**
