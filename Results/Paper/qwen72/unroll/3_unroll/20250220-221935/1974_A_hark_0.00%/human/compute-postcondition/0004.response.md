Functionality: ** The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The function then calls `func_2` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `func_2` has been called `t` times. The function does not return any value. **
