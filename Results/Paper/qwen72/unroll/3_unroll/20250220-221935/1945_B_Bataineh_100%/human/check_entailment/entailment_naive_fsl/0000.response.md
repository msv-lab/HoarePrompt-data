Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where both `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `m`. In such cases, the number of fireworks visible simultaneously can be greater than the values calculated by the program.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 10
```
According to the problem description, both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for 11 minutes. Therefore, at any given time, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously should be 11 (since each firework launched from both installations will be visible for 11 minutes).

However, the program will output:
```
20
```
This is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap correctly. The correct output should be:
```
11
```

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
