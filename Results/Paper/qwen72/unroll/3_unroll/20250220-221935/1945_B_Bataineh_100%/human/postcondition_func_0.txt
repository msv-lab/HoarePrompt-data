The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input. Based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`, the function prints a specific integer result for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed to the console. The input variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are not modified and retain their initial values as provided in each test case.
