### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` which represent the firing intervals of the two installations and the visibility duration of each firework, respectively.

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - The function uses a series of `if` and `elif` statements to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
   - **Case 1: `m < a` and `m < b`**
     - If the visibility duration `m` is less than both firing intervals `a` and `b`, then the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2. This is because no two fireworks from the same installation can overlap, but one firework from each installation can be visible at the same time.
   - **Case 2: `m < a` and `m > b`**
     - If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, then the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `2 + m // b`. This is because one firework from the first installation and multiple fireworks from the second installation can be visible at the same time, depending on how many times `b` fits into `m`.
   - **Case 3: `m < b` and `m > a`**
     - If `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`, then the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `2 + m // a`. This is similar to the previous case but with the roles of `a` and `b` reversed.
   - **Case 4: `m >= a` and `m >= b`**
     - If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, then the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `m // a + m // b + 2`. This is because multiple fireworks from both installations can be visible at the same time, and we add 2 to account for the initial fireworks from both installations.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where `a` and `b` are equal, and `m` is very large (up to \(10^{18}\)).
   - The function also handles the case where `a` and `b` are both 1, which is a special case where the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `2 + m`.

5. **Overall State:**
   - The function processes all test cases as expected and prints the results to the console.
   - The input variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are not modified and retain their initial values as provided in each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the given conditions and edge cases, and it produces the expected output for the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
