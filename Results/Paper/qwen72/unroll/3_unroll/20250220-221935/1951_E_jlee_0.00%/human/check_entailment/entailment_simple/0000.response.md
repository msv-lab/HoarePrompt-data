### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string` and converts it to a list `s` for easier manipulation.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the length of the string `n` is 1, the function correctly prints "NO" because a single character string is always a palindrome.
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different (`x != s[-1]`), the function correctly prints "YES" and the entire string as the partition, as the string is already non-palindromic.
   - If all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), the function correctly prints "NO" because any substring of a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.
   - If all characters except one are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), the function checks if the string is of odd length and the middle character is different from `x`. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the entire string as the partition.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The function iterates through the first half of the string to check for non-palindromic substrings.
   - If it finds a pair of characters that are not the same (`s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`), it prints "YES" and the entire string as the partition, as the string is non-palindromic.
   - If it finds a character different from `x` (`s[j] != x`), it sets `count` to the index of this character.
   - If `count` is set and another different character is found, it checks if the current index is less than `count`. If so, it prints "YES" and a partition of the string into two substrings.
   - If the current index is equal to `count`, it further checks if `count` is greater than 1. If so, it prints "YES" and a partition of the string into two substrings.
   - If the current index is greater than `count`, it prints "YES" and a partition of the string into two substrings.

4. **Final Check:**
   - If none of the conditions for printing "YES" are met, the function prints "NO".

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and the main logic for partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings. It ensures that the output is valid for each test case and follows the problem description accurately.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
