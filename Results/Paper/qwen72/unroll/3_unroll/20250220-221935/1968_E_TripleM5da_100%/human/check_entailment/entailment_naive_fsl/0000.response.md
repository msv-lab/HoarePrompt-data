Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for every potential case. For example, consider the case when \(n = 3\). The program outputs the following points:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
- \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
- \(|1-3| + |2-1| = 3\)
- \(|3-3| + |3-3| = 0\)

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 4. However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should have a set \(\mathcal{H}\) of size 5, as shown in the problem description:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- \(|2-2| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
- \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
- \(|2-3| + |1-3| = 3\)
- \(|3-3| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|3-3| + |1-3| = 2\)
- \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4, but the optimal size is 5. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
