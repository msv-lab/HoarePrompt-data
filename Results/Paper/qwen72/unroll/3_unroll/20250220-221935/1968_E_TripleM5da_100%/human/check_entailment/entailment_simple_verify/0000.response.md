Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for every potential case. Specifically, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\), which results in a set \(\mathcal{H}\) of size 4. However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should have a set \(\mathcal{H}\) of size 5, as shown in the problem description.

Let's analyze the program's behavior for different values of \(n\):

1. **For \(n = 2\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances between these points are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2. This is the optimal size for \(n = 2\).

2. **For \(n = 3\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances between these points are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
     - \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
     - \(|1-3| + |2-1| = 3\)
     - \(|3-3| + |3-3| = 0\)
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 4. However, the optimal size for \(n = 3\) is 5, as shown in the problem description:
     ```
     2 1
     2 3
     3 1
     ```
     - The Manhattan distances between these points are:
       - \(|2-2| + |1-1| = 0\)
       - \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
       - \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
       - \(|2-3| + |1-3| = 3\)
       - \(|3-3| + |1-1| = 0\)
       - \(|3-3| + |1-3| = 2\)
       - \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4, but the optimal size is 5.

3. **For \(n = 4\)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1

     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
     - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
     - \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
     - \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
     - \(|3-4| + |3-4| = 2\)
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 7. However, the optimal size for \(n = 4\) is 6, as shown in the problem description:
     ```
     1 1
     1 3
     4 3
     4 4
     ```
     - The Manhattan distances between these points are:

       - \(|1-4| + |3-3| = 3\)
       - \(|1-4| + |3-4| = 4\)

     - \(|3-5| + |3-5| = 4\)
     - \(|4-5| + |4-5| = 2\)
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which has a size of 9. However, the optimal size for \(n = 5\) is 8, as shown in the problem description:

       - \(|1-5| + |1-4| = 7\)
       - \(|2-5| + |1-5| = 7\)
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7\}\), which has a size of 7, but the optimal size is 8.

5. **For \(n = 6\)**:
