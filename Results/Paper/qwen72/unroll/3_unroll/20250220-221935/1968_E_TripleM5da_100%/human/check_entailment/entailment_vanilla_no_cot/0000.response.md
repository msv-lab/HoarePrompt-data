Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). Specifically, the program always starts by printing the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), and then for the remaining points, it prints \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This approach does not ensure that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized for all \(n\).

For example, consider \(n = 3\):
- The program outputs:
  - (1, 1)
  - (1, 2)
  - (3, 3)

The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
- \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 3, 4\}\), which has 4 distinct distances. However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should have 5 distinct distances, as shown in the problem description.

A correct approach would involve a more strategic placement of points to ensure that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized. For example, a correct solution might involve placing points in a way that covers the maximum range of distances, such as using a diagonal or a combination of points that spread out the distances more effectively.
