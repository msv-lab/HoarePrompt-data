The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` and the constraint on `n` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, the input must be a positive integer. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input is a positive integer, and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer for each test case such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 0, and the input must be a positive integer**
