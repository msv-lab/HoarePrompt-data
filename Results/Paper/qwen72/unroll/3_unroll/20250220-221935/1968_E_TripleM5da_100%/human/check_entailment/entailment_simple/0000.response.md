Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program's logic is as follows:

1. For each test case, it reads an integer \(n\) (the size of the grid).
2. It prints the cell \((1, 1)\).
3. It prints the cell \((1, 2)\).
4. For each \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), it prints the cell \((i, i)\).

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

- **For \(n = 2\)**:
  - The program prints \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
  - The Manhattan distances are \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\) and \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\).
  - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 2\).

- **For \(n = 3\)**:
  - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\).
  - The Manhattan distances are:
    - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
    - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
    - \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\)
    - \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
    - \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
    - \(|3-3| + |3-3| = 0\)
  - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 4. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\).

- **For \(n = 4\)**:
  - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\).
  - The Manhattan distances are:
    - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
    - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
    - \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\)
    - \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
    - \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
    - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
    - \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
    - \(|3-3| + |3-3| = 0\)
    - \(|3-4| + |3-4| = 2\)
    - \(|4-4| + |4-4| = 0\)
  - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 7. This is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 4\). The maximum possible size is 10, which can be achieved by a different arrangement.

- **For \(n = 5\)**:
  - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\).
  - The Manhattan distances are:
    - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
    - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
    - \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\)
    - \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
    - \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
    - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
    - \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
    - \(|1-5| + |1-5| = 8\)
    - \(|1-5| + |2-5| = 7\)
    - \(|3-3| + |3-3| = 0\)
    - \(|3-4| + |3-4| = 2\)
    - \(|3-5| + |3-5| = 4\)
    - \(|4-4| + |4-4| = 0\)
    - \(|4-5| + |4-5| = 2\)
    - \(|5-5| + |5-5| = 0\)
  - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which has a size of 9. This is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 5\). The maximum possible size is 13, which can be achieved by a different arrangement.

- **For \(n = 6\)**:
  - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\).
  - The Manhattan distances are:
    - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
    - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
    - \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\)
    - \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
    - \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
    - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
    - \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
    - \(|1-5| + |1-5| = 8\)
    - \(|1-5| + |2-5| = 7\)
    - \(|1-6| + |1-6| = 10\)
    - \(|1-6| + |2-6| = 9\)
    - \(|3-3| + |3-3| = 0\)
    - \(|3-4| + |3-4| = 2\)
    - \(|3-5| + |3-5| = 4\)
    - \(|3-6| + |3-6| = 6\)
    - \(|4-4| + |4-4| = 0\)
    - \(|4-5| + |4-5| = 2\)
    - \(|4-6| + |4-6| = 4\)
    - \(|5-5| + |5-5| = 0\)
    - \(|5-6| + |5-6| = 2\)
    - \(|6-6| + |6-6| = 0\)
  - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\), which has a size of 11. This is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 6\). The maximum possible size is 16, which can be achieved by a different arrangement.

The program's approach of printing \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\) does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n > 2\). For larger \(n\), the set of distances generated by this approach is smaller than the maximum possible set of distances.

Correctness: **False**
