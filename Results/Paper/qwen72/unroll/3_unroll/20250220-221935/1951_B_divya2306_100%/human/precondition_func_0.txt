The function should take two parameters: `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of cows (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `k` is the index of your cow (1 ≤ k ≤ n). Additionally, it should take a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided as input. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
