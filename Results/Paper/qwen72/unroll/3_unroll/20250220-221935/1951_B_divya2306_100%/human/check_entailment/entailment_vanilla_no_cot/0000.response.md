Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from solving the problem correctly:

1. **Function Call Issue**: The function `func_1()` is called inside the loop, but it is not defined before the loop. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is run.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Wins Calculation**:
   - The initial loop to calculate `wins` is incorrect. It should only consider the matches that your cow would win if it stays in its original position. The loop should stop when your cow loses a match.
   - The logic for calculating `win_with_swap` is also flawed. The program attempts to calculate the number of wins after a swap, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where the swap can maximize the number of wins.

3. **Incorrect Output Calculation**:
   - The final output calculation is incorrect. The program should print the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve, either without swapping or with the optimal swap.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:

1. **Calculate the number of wins without swapping**:
   - Start from the initial position of your cow and count how many matches it can win by comparing its rating with the next cow's rating.

2. **Calculate the number of wins with the optimal swap**:
   - Consider swapping your cow to a position where it can win the maximum number of matches. This involves finding the best position to swap to, which is the position just before the first cow with a higher rating than your cow.

3. **Print the maximum of the two results**.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        wins_without_swap = 0
        for i in range(k - 1, n - 1):
            if a[i] > a[i + 1]:
                a[i + 1] = a[i]
            else:
                break
        wins_without_swap = i - (k - 1) + 1

        wins_with_swap = 0
        for i in range(k - 2, -1, -1):
            if a[i] < a[k - 1]:
                wins_with_swap = 1
                for j in range(i, n - 1):
                    if a[j] > a[j + 1]:
                        a[j + 1] = a[j]
                    else:
                        break
                wins_with_swap += j - i
                break

        print(max(wins_without_swap, wins_with_swap))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. ** wins_without_swap **:
   - This loop counts the number of matches your cow can win if it stays in its original position. It simulates the matches and stops when your cow loses.

2. ** wins_with_swap **:
   - This loop finds the optimal position to swap your cow to. It starts from the position just before your cow and moves backward until it finds a cow with a lower rating.
   - After finding the optimal swap position, it simulates the matches starting from the new position and counts the number of wins.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum number of wins between the two scenarios.

This corrected program should handle the problem correctly and produce the expected output.
