### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The condition `if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1` is correct:
     - If `x_a > x_b`, Alice cannot catch Bob as she can only move down and Bob can only move up.
     - If `h == 1`, neither player can move, so the game ends in a draw.

3. **Parity Check:**
   - The condition `if clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0)` is correct but can be simplified to `if (clues[2] - clues[4]) % 2 == 0`.
   - The logic for checking the absolute difference between `y_a` and `y_b` and the remaining rows is overly complex and contains some errors:
     - For `y_a == y_b`, Bob wins if the parities are the same.
     - For `y_a < y_b` and `y_a > y_b`, the conditions for determining the winner or a draw are not correctly simplified and can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Different Parity:**
   - The logic for different parities is also overly complex and contains some errors:
     - For `y_a == y_b`, Alice wins if the parities are different.
     - For `y_a < y_b` and `y_a > y_b`, the conditions for determining the winner or a draw are not correctly simplified and can lead to incorrect results.

5. **Output:**
   - The function collects the results for each test case and prints them one by one.

### Correctness:

The original program has overly complex and incorrect logic for determining the outcome of the game. The simplified logic provided in the corrected program is more accurate and handles all the conditions as described in the problem.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    answers = []
    for i in range(test_cases):
        h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b = map(int, input().split())
        if x_a > x_b or h == 1:
            answers.append('Draw')
        elif (x_a - x_b) % 2 == 0:
            if y_a == y_b:
                answers.append('Bob')
            elif abs(y_a - y_b) > 1:
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
        else:
            if y_a == y_b:
                answers.append('Alice')
            elif abs(y_a - y_b) > 1:
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Alice')
    for j in answers:
        print(j)
```

### Final Correctness:

The original program is incorrect due to overly complex and flawed logic. The corrected program simplifies the logic and correctly handles all the conditions as described in the problem.

Final: **False**
