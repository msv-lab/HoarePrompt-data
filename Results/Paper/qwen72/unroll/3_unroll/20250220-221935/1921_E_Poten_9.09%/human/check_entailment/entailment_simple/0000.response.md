### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` is missing parameters in its definition. It should take `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` as arguments. The current definition `def func():` is incorrect.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the input for each test case. However, it does not pass these inputs to the function `func`, which means the function is not being used correctly.

3. **Logic for Determining the Outcome**:
   - **Initial Checks**:
     - If `x_a > x_b` or `h == 1`, the game is a draw because Alice cannot move down if she is already below Bob, and if the board has only one row, no one can move.
     - If `x_a` and `x_b` have the same parity (both even or both odd), the program checks if the chips are in the same column. If they are, Bob wins because he can always move to Alice's position.
     - If the chips are not in the same column and the distance between them is greater than 1, the program checks if the distance is greater than half the vertical distance between the chips. If so, the game is a draw. Otherwise, Bob wins.
     - If `x_a` and `x_b` have different parities, the program checks if the chips are in the same column. If they are, Alice wins because she can always move to Bob's position.
     - If the chips are not in the same column and the distance between them is greater than 1, the program checks if the distance is greater than half the vertical distance between the chips. If so, the game is a draw. Otherwise, Alice wins.

4. **Output Handling**: The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Function Definition**: The function `func` should be defined with parameters.
- **Function Call**: The function `func` should be called with the appropriate arguments for each test case.
- **Logical Errors**: The logic for determining the outcome is complex and may have some issues. For example, the conditions for checking the distance between the chips and their parities are not straightforward and may lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the function definition and the potential logical errors, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness: **False**
