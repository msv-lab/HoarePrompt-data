Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and for each test case, a valid string s exists that corresponds to the given trace.**

The variable `a` is now a string containing all lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the constraints on `n` and the existence of a valid string `s` for each test case are still valid.
