Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order. According to the problem description, the penalty for such an array should be `n-1` because every element (except the last one) is less than the next element. However, the given program does not account for this and will output `0` for such cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The correct output should be `4` because the array is already sorted, and the penalty is `4` (since there are 4 indices where `a_i < a_{i+1}`). However, the program will output `0` because it does not correctly count the penalty in this case.
