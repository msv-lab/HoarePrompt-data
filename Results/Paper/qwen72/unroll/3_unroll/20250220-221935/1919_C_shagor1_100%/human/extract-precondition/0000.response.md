Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the size of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. The correct precondition would be: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.**

However, since the function definition provided is `def func_1():` without any parameters, this does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and the list `a`.

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and test_cases is a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list a of length n with integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).**
