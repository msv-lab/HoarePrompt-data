The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the size of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. The correct precondition would be: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
