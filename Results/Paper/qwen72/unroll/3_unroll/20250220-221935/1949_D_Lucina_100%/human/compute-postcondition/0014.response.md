Output State: **The list `sa` will contain the indices of rows (and columns) where there is at least one 'F' character and no 'S' characters, as well as any additional indices `i` from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0. The list `sb` will remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, `xx`, and `n` remain unchanged. The length of `sa` will be greater than or equal to its initial length, and `t` will be equal to the new length of `sa`.**
