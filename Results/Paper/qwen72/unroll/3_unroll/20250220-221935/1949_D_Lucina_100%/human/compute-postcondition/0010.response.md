Postcondition: **The list `sa` will contain the indices of rows (and columns) where there is at least one 'F' character and no 'S' characters. The list `sb` will contain the indices of rows (and columns) where there is at least one 'S' character and no 'F' characters. The values of `a`, `b`, `xx`, `n`, and the input matrix remain unchanged. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**
