Postcondition: **The list `sa` will contain the indices of rows (and columns) where there is at least one 'F' character and no 'S' characters. The list `sb` will contain the indices of rows (and columns) where there is at least one 'S' character and no 'F' characters. The values of `a`, `b`, `xx`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, `sa` will also contain additional indices `i` from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, and `t` will be equal to the new length of `sa`. The loop will print a string `nx` for each row `i` from 1 to `n`, where each character in `nx` is either the original character from `xx[i][j-1]` if it is not '?', 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, or 'S' otherwise. If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, both `sa` and `sb` will remain unchanged, and the loop will print a series of strings `nx`, where each string `nx` is constructed by iterating over the rows of `xx` from 1 to `n`. For each row, if the character at position `j-1` is not '?', it will be added to `nx`. If the character is '?', and the row index `i` or column index `j` is in the first quarter of the `sb` list (up to `n // 4 - 1`), 'S' will be added to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' will be added to `nx`.**
