Output State: The list `sa` will contain the indices of rows (and columns) where there is at least one 'F' character and no 'S' characters, as well as any indices `i` from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0. The list `sb` will remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, `xx`, `n`, and the input matrix remain unchanged. The length of `sa` will be greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, and `t` will still be equal to the original length of `sa` before the loop execution.
