Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, representing the transition video plan.
   - It initializes lists `a` and `b` to count the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in each row (and column) of the input matrix.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input matrix, with an empty string at the beginning to make the indices 1-based.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S' Characters:**
   - The program iterates through the input matrix, updating the counts in `a` and `b` for each 'F' and 'S' character.
   - This ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` correctly reflect the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in the i-th row (and column).

3. **Identifying Rows with Only 'F' or Only 'S':**
   - The program creates two lists, `sa` and `sb`, to store the indices of rows (and columns) where there are only 'F' characters and only 'S' characters, respectively.
   - This helps in determining which rows have a bias towards 'F' or 'S'.

4. **Handling Undecided Characters:**
   - If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, the program appends rows with no 'F' or 'S' characters to `sa` and then fills in the '?' characters in the matrix.
   - For the first quarter of the rows in `sa`, it assigns 'F' to the '?' characters.
   - For the remaining rows, it assigns 'S' to the '?' characters.
   - If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, it follows a similar process but with 'S' and 'F' swapped.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the modified matrix, ensuring that the constraints are met.

**Key Points to Verify:**
- **Symmetry:** The program ensures that the matrix remains symmetric by updating both `a[i]` and `a[j]` (and `b[i]` and `b[j]`) for each 'F' or 'S' character.
- **Constraints:** The program ensures that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type are shown for any permutation of scenarios.
- **Undecided Characters:** The program correctly handles '?' characters by distributing 'F' and 'S' in a way that respects the constraints.

**Potential Issues:**
- **Indexing:** The program uses 1-based indexing for `xx`, `a`, and `b`, which is consistent throughout.
- **First Quarter Calculation:** The program uses `n // 4 - 1` to determine the first quarter of the rows. This might be incorrect for small values of `n` (e.g., `n = 2` or `n = 3`), where `n // 4 - 1` could be negative or zero. However, the problem constraints (2 \le n \le 24) and the fact that at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are decided should ensure that this is not a practical issue.
- **Symmetry Check:** The program should ensure that the matrix remains symmetric after filling in the '?' characters. This is implicitly handled by the input constraints and the way the program updates the matrix.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and produce a valid output.

Correctness: **True**
