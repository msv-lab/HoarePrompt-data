Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically in ensuring that no permutation of scenarios results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
5
.?F??
?.???
F?.S?
??S.?
??.?.
```

**Expected Output:**
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FFSF.F
FFFF.
```

**Actual Output:**
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FFSF.F
FFFF.
```

In this case, the program assigns the transition videos in a way that might not satisfy the requirement for all permutations. For example, consider the permutation of scenarios: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The sequence of transition videos would be: F, F, S, F. This sequence does not violate the constraint, but the program's logic does not guarantee that no permutation will violate the constraint.

The program's logic for assigning 'F' and 'S' to the '?' characters is based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in each scenario, but it does not consider the overall sequence of transition videos for all permutations. This can lead to scenarios where the constraint is violated.

To ensure correctness, the program should have a more sophisticated approach to assign 'F' and 'S' to the '?' characters, possibly involving backtracking or a more comprehensive check to ensure no permutation of scenarios results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
