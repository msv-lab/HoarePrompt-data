Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type are shown, regardless of the order in which the scenarios are played. It does this by first counting the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in each row (and column) of the input matrix. It then identifies rows (and columns) that contain only 'F' or only 'S' and uses this information to decide how to replace the '?' characters.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Parsing and Counting:**
   - The program reads the integer `n` and the input matrix.
   - It initializes lists `a` and `b` to count the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in each row (and column), respectively.
   - It also stores the input matrix in the list `xx`.

2. **Identifying Rows with Only 'F' or Only 'S':**
   - The program identifies rows (and columns) where there is at least one 'F' character and no 'S' characters, and stores their indices in the list `sa`.
   - Similarly, it identifies rows (and columns) where there is at least one 'S' character and no 'F' characters, and stores their indices in the list `sb`.

3. **Deciding the Replacement for '?':**
   - If the number of rows with only 'F' (no 'S') is greater than or equal to the number of rows with only 'S' (no 'F'), the program adds any remaining rows (and columns) with no 'F' or 'S' to `sa`.
   - For each row, it constructs a new string `nx` by:
     - Keeping the original character if it is not '?'.
     - Replacing '?' with 'F' if the row index `i` or column index `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.
     - Replacing '?' with 'S' otherwise.
   - If the number of rows with only 'S' (no 'F') is greater than the number of rows with only 'F' (no 'S'), the program adds any remaining rows (and columns) with no 'F' or 'S' to `sb`.
   - For each row, it constructs a new string `nx` by:
     - Keeping the original character if it is not '?'.
     - Replacing '?' with 'S' if the row index `i` or column index `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`.
     - Replacing '?' with 'F' otherwise.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Indexing and Off-by-One Errors:**
   - The program uses `n // 4 - 1` to determine the number of rows to consider for the first quarter. This might lead to an off-by-one error, especially when `n` is small. For example, if `n = 4`, `n // 4 - 1` would be `-1`, which is not valid.
   - The program should use `n // 4` instead of `n // 4 - 1` to correctly handle the first quarter of rows.

2. **Symmetry and Consistency:**
   - The program ensures that the matrix remains symmetric by updating both `xx[i][j - 1]` and `xx[j][i - 1]` when replacing '?' characters. However, this is not explicitly shown in the code, but it is implied by the problem constraints and the input format.

3. **Handling the Maximum Consecutive Videos:**
   - The program's logic for replacing '?' characters is designed to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown. However, the logic might not always guarantee this, especially if the initial distribution of 'F' and 'S' characters is not balanced.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is generally sound, but there are potential issues with the indexing and the handling of the first quarter of rows. These issues could lead to incorrect behavior in certain edge cases. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
