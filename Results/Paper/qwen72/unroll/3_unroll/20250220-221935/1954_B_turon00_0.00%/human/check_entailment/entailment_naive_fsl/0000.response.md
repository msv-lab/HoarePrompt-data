Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

The program incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `1`. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. The program only checks the count of the first element in the array and does not consider other elements that might have a lower count, which is necessary to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
