You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. For each iteration, the variable `ans` holds the minimum length of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are equal to the first element of `a`. If all elements in `a` are the same, `ans` is -1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are unchanged for each test case, but the loop has printed the value of `ans` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves a list of integers `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum length of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to the first element of `a`. If all elements in `a` are the same, it prints -1. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are unchanged for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Identifying a Beautiful Array**:
   - The problem states that the array is already beautiful, so we don't need to check if it is beautiful. We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make it not beautiful.

3. **Handling Arrays with All Identical Elements**:
   - If the array contains only one unique element (i.e., all elements are the same), it is impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements. The program correctly handles this case by checking if the length of the set of elements `aa` is 1. If so, it prints `-1`.

4. **Counting and Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - The program initializes `cnt` to count the number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element `tmp`.
   - It iterates through the array and updates `cnt` whenever it encounters an element equal to `tmp`.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one final time to ensure the last segment of consecutive elements is considered.
   - The program then prints `ans`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element (which is not beautiful by definition, but the problem guarantees the array is beautiful).
   - It also handles the case where the array has all identical elements, as mentioned earlier.

6. **Algorithm Validity**:
   - The algorithm is based on the idea that if we can find the smallest segment of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element, removing all elements in this segment will make the array not beautiful.
   - This is a valid approach because removing the smallest segment of consecutive elements will minimize the number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and follows the correct approach to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
