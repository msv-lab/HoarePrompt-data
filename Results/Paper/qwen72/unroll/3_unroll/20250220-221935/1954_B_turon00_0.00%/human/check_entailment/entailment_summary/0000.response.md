Reasoning:
The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. The program's logic is as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Check for All Elements Being the Same**: If all elements in the array `a` are the same, the program prints `-1` because removing any number of elements will still leave an array where all elements are the same, and thus it will remain beautiful.

3. **Count Consecutive Elements**: The program then counts the length of consecutive segments of the array where the elements are equal to the first element `a[0]`. It keeps track of the minimum length of such segments in the variable `ans`.

4. **Output the Result**: Finally, it prints the minimum length of these segments, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

However, there are a few issues with this logic:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Elements to Remove**: The program calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments where the elements are equal to the first element. This is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The correct approach should involve finding the minimum number of elements to remove such that no valid operation can be performed to make all elements the same.

- **Handling of Non-Uniform Arrays**: The program does not correctly handle arrays where the elements are not all the same but still form a beautiful array. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will output `1` because it finds a segment of length `1` (the first element), but the correct answer should be `1` because removing the last element makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array length is 1 or 2, which should always output `-1` since it's impossible to make a non-beautiful array from these lengths.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
