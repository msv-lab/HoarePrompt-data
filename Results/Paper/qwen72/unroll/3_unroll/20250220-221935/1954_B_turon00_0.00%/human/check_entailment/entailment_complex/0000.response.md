Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself. This matches the problem description.

2. **Checking for Uniform Array**: The function checks if all elements in the array `a` are the same by converting the array to a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. If so, it prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem description because an array of identical elements cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding Minimum Consecutive Elements to Remove**: The function initializes `cnt` to 0 and `ans` to `n` (the length of the array). It then iterates through the array to count the number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element `tmp`. When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0. After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final count of consecutive elements.

4. **Output**: The function prints `ans` for each test case, which is intended to be the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

However, there is a logical issue in the approach:

- The function counts the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element `tmp` and prints this length. This is incorrect because the problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, not the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements.

- For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the function will count the sequence `[1, 1, 1]` and print `3`, but the correct answer is `1` (removing the last `1` makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]` which is not beautiful).

- The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is not uniform but can still be made non-beautiful by removing fewer elements than the longest sequence of consecutive elements.

**Conclusion**:
The function does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
