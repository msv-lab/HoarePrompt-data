To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the behavior of the functions `func_3()`, `func_6()`, and `func_7()` as they relate to the loop and the initial state.

Given:
- Initial State: `testcases` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`.
- No variables are passed to the function `func_7`.

The loop:
```python
for _ in range(testcases):
    func_6()
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: `testcases` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`.
2. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs `testcases` times, and in each iteration, `func_6()` is called.

Since no variables are passed to `func_7` and it is not mentioned in the loop, it does not affect the loop's execution.

### Output State:
- **`testcases`**: The value of `testcases` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
- **`func_6()`**: The function `func_6()` is called `testcases` times, but since no information is provided about what `func_6()` does, we assume it does not modify any variables in the loop head or body.

Therefore, the output state after the loop has finished executing is the same as the initial state, except that `func_6()` has been called `testcases` times.

Output State: **`testcases` remains the value returned by `func_3()`.**
