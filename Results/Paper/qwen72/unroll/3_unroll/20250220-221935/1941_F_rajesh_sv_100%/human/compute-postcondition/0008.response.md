Output State: **The values of `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` will be the largest and second largest differences between consecutive elements in the list `A`, respectively. The value of `index` will be the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` will remain unchanged. `left` is equal to `A[index - 1]` and `right` is equal to `A[index]`. `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.**

The code assigns the value of `max_diff` to the variable `ans`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
