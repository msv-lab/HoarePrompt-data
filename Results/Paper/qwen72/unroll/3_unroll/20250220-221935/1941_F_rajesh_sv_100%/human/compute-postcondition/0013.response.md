Functionality: ** The function `func_6` processes a list `A` of `n` strictly increasing integers, a sorted list `D` of unique integers representing model complexities, and a list `F` of integers representing function complexities. It identifies the largest and second largest differences between consecutive elements in `A`. Then, it calculates the minimum possible maximum difference between pairs of elements in `A` after applying each function complexity `f` in `F` to the model complexities in `D`. Finally, it prints the maximum of the initial largest difference and the calculated minimum possible maximum difference. The function does not return any value. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
