The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `testcases`. For the loop to execute, `testcases` must be a positive integer. The variable `_` is a dummy variable that will take on values from 0 to `testcases - 1` during the loop execution, but it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is automatically managed by the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `testcases` is greater than 0. The function `func_3()` must return a value that is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0, `_` is a dummy variable**
