Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing one cube from the top of the tower. 

The logic in the function `func_1` is based on the following observations:
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. ** Moves**: Each move can either add or remove one cube.
3. **Final State**: After `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be expressed as the initial number of cubes (0) plus the net number of cubes added or removed. This net number must be `m` for the tower to have exactly `m` cubes.
4. **Possible Moves**: To end up with exactly `m` cubes, the number of moves `n` must be such that the difference `n - m` is even. This is because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) cancels out, and the remaining moves must be all adds to reach `m` cubes.

The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` checks:
- **Even Difference**: `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even.
- **Non-negative Difference**: `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the desired number of cubes, which is necessary because you cannot remove more cubes than you have added.

However, there is a small issue in the program:
- The function `func_1` is called inside the loop, but it is defined after the loop. In Python, functions must be defined before they are called.

To fix this, we should move the definition of `func_1` before the loop where it is called.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()
```

With this correction, the program will work as intended.

Correctness: **True** (after the correction mentioned above)
