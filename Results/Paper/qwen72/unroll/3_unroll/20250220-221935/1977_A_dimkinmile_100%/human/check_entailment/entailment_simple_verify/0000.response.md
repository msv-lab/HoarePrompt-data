Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Call Order**: The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` is called before it is defined. This will indeed result in a runtime error. The correct order should be to define the function before the loop that calls it.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by calling `func_1`. Inside `func_1`, the program reads the values of `n` and `m` from the input, which is appropriate for the problem description.

3. **Logic for Determining the Result**:
   - The original assessment also correctly identifies a flaw in the logic inside `func_1`. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - The correct condition should be `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. This ensures that:
     - `n >= m`: Nikita has enough moves to potentially reach `m` cubes.
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: The difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even, which means the sequence of moves can be balanced (i.e., for every cube added, there is a corresponding cube removed, or vice versa, to reach exactly `m` cubes).

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n = 3` and `m = 3`, the correct output is "Yes" because Nikita can put 1 cube on top 3 times.
   - For `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the correct output is "No" because it is impossible to have 4 cubes after 2 moves.
   - For `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the correct output is "Yes" because Nikita can put 1 cube on top 4 times and then remove 1 cube, resulting in 3 cubes.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program as written will not run due to the function call order issue.
   - Even if the function call order is corrected, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly solve the problem.

Final: **False**
