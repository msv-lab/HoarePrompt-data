### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, using `int(input())`.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `kreker` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic for Determining Possibility**:
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves must match the parity of the number of cubes added or removed.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the desired number of cubes `m`, which is necessary because you cannot have a negative number of moves to achieve a positive number of cubes.

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - The function `func_1` is called `kreker` times, and it should handle each test case independently.
  - The function should take two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are integers such that `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`.

- **Inside `func_1`**:
  - `n, m = map(int, input().split())` correctly reads two integers from the input.
  - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
  - The condition `n - m >= 0` checks if the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the desired number of cubes `m`.

- **State after the function concludes**:
  - The input values `n` and `m` have been processed, and the appropriate message has been printed based on the conditions.

### Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` and `3 - 3 >= 0` are both true.
  - The program prints "Yes", which is correct.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `(2 - 4) % 2 == 0` is true, but `2 - 4 >= 0` is false.
  - The program prints "No", which is correct.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` and `5 - 3 >= 0` are both true.
  - The program prints "Yes", which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions and the overall structure of the program are sound and handle the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
