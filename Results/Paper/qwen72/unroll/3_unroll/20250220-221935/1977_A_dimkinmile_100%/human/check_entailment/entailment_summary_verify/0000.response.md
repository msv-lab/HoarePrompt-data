### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Call Order**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` is called before it is defined, which will result in a runtime error. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case. This part of the program is logically correct, but the function call order is incorrect.

3. **Logic Inside `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user input.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is used to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that this condition is flawed. Specifically, the condition `n - m >= 0` is not sufficient to ensure that the number of moves is sufficient. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 1`, the program will output "No" when it should output "Yes" because Nikita can put a cube and then remove it, or just put a cube once.
   - The correct condition should be `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. This ensures that the number of moves is sufficient and that the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference between `n` and `m` is correct.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()
```

### Evaluation:

- **Function Definition and Call Order**:
  - The function `func_1` is now defined before it is called, which resolves the runtime error.

- **Logic Inside `func_1`**:
  - The condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` correctly determines if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
  - This condition ensures that the number of moves is sufficient (`n >= m`) and that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even, which is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, and the parity of the number of moves must match the parity of the number of cubes.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the function call order and the flawed logic inside `func_1`. The corrected program, as shown above, is the correct implementation for the given problem description.
