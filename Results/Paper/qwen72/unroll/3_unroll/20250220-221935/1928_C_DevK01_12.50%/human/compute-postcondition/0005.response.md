To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`
   - `w`

2. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `1` to `int(w // 1)` is non-empty.
   - `int(w // 1)` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute at least once.

### Given State:
- `q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\).
- `M` is an empty list if `w` is not an integer or if `w` is less than `x - 1`.
- If `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list containing the integer `w`.
- `w` is the square root of `q`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine the Value of `w`:**
   - `w` is the square root of `q`.
   - Since `q` is an integer, `w` will be an integer if `q` is a perfect square.

2. **Check the Condition for `w`:**
   - For the loop to execute, `int(w // 1)` must be greater than `1`.
   - This means `w` must be greater than `1`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - `w` must be an integer and greater than `1`.
   - `i` must start at `1` and go up to `int(w // 1) - 1`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\).
- `w` is the square root of `q` and must be an integer greater than `1`.
- `M` is a list containing the integer `w` if `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q` and must be an integer greater than `1`, `M` is a list containing the integer `w` if `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` is 1**
