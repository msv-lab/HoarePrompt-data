You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two integers, `q` and `x`, where `1 <= x < q <= 10^9`. It returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding complementary divisors (i.e., `q // i`), also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it is also included in the list `M`. The function does not modify the input parameters `q` and `x`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for some potential cases:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the edge case where `n` is equal to `x`. According to the problem description, if `n == x`, then the only possible value for `k` is `n + 1`, but the program does not account for this.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**: The program calculates `y` as `n + x` and then checks if `y % 2 != 0`. However, this check is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `n = 10` and `x = 2`, `y` is `12`, which is even, but the program should still correctly determine the possible values of `k`.

3. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`. However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed. It adds the square root `w` to the list `M` if `w` is an integer and `w >= x - 1`, but this is not always the correct condition. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where `q` is a perfect square.

4. **Incorrect Set Conversion**: The program converts the list `L1` to a set to remove duplicates, but it does not ensure that the values in `L1` are valid `k` values according to the problem description. Specifically, it does not check if the values are greater than 1.

To illustrate the issues, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 10`, `x = 2`
- Expected Output: `4` (k = 2, 3, 5, 6)
- Actual Output: The program may not correctly identify all valid `k` values due to the issues mentioned above.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
