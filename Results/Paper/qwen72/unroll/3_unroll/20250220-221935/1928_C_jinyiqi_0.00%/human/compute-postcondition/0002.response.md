The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `x`, and the range parameters. The loop will execute if the range is not empty, which means `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1. This is true as long as `x` is at least 1, which is already part of the given state (`1 <= x < n <= 10^9`). 

Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `x` is within the specified range. The variable `i` will start at 1, and the range will be from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

State: **`n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 1**
