### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem describes a pattern where the first \( k \) positions are numbered from 1 to \( k \), the next \( k-2 \) positions are numbered from \( k-1 \) to 2, and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), we need to check if \( n \) can be a valid position in the pattern for some \( k \).

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - If \( n \) is in the first \( k \) positions, \( n \) should be in the range \( 1 \leq n \leq k \) and \( x \) should be \( n \).
   - If \( n \) is in the next \( k-2 \) positions, \( n \) should be in the range \( k+1 \leq n \leq 2k-2 \) and \( x \) should be \( 2k - n \).

4. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - We need to find \( k \) such that \( n \) and \( x \) satisfy the above conditions.
   - This can be broken down into two cases:
     - Case 1: \( n \leq k \) and \( x = n \).
     - Case 2: \( k < n \leq 2k-2 \) and \( x = 2k - n \).

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \)
     - \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \)
   - For each condition, it calls `func_1` to find the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) respectively.
   - It then checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \( x \), and appends them to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list and prints the length of the list.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of a given number \( x \).
   - It iterates from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \) and checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( i \).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( i \), it adds both \( i \) and \( \frac{x}{i} \) to the list of divisors.
   - It then reverses the list of smaller divisors and appends them to the list of larger divisors.

7. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It correctly checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \( x \).
   - The logic for checking the conditions and appending the valid \( k \) values to the `output` list is correct.
   - The final step of removing duplicates and printing the length of the `output` list is also correct.

However, there is a subtle issue in the program:
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid. The problem statement clearly states that \( k > 1 \). The program should ensure that \( k \) is always greater than 1.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Case 1**: \( n \leq k \) and \( x = n \)
  - This condition is correctly checked by the program.
- **Case 2**: \( k < n \leq 2k-2 \) and \( x = 2k - n \)
  - This condition is also correctly checked by the program.
- **Divisors Check**:
  - The program correctly finds divisors and checks if they plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \( x \).
- **Handling \( k > 1 \)**:
  - The program does not explicitly ensure that \( k \) is greater than 1. However, the conditions \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \) inherently exclude \( k = 1 \) because \( k = 1 \) would not satisfy these conditions (since \( 2k - 2 = 0 \)).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values for the given constraints. The conditions \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \) ensure that \( k \) is greater than 1. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
