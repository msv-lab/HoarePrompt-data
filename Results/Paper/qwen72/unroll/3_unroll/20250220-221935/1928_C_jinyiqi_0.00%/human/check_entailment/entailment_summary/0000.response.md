### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \).
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned to Vasya's position \( n \) must match \( x \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) and checks if these values are even.
   - If \( n + x - 2 \) is even, it calls `func_1` to get the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \).
   - If \( n - x \) is even, it calls `func_1` to get the divisors of \( n - x \).
   - It then checks if each divisor \( s \) plus 2 is even and if \( (s + 2) / 2 \) is greater than or equal to \( x \).
   - The valid \( k \) values are collected in the `output` list and duplicates are removed using `set`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` returns a list of all divisors of \( x \).
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of \( x \) and checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( i \).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( i \), both \( i \) and \( x / i \) are added to the list.
   - The list of divisors greater than or equal to the square root is reversed and concatenated with the list of divisors less than the square root.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It checks if these divisors plus 2 are even and if they result in a valid \( k \) (i.e., \( k \geq x \)).
   - The program ensures that each valid \( k \) is unique by converting the list to a set before outputting the result.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid by ensuring \( k > 1 \).
   - The program also handles the case where no valid \( k \) exists, as seen in the test case \( n = 100 \) and \( x = 99 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values for the given constraints. It accurately processes the input and produces the correct output for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
