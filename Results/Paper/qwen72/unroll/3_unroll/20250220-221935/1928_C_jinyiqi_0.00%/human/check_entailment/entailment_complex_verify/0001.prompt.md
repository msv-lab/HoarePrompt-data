You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and x are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.

    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that combines `output2` (containing divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`) and `output1` (containing divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` and returns a list containing all divisors of `x`. The divisors that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x` are listed first, followed by the divisors that are less than the square root of `x` in reverse order. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem describes a pattern where the first \( k \) positions are numbered from 1 to \( k \), the next \( k-2 \) positions are numbered from \( k-1 \) to 2, and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), we need to check if \( n \) can be a valid position in the pattern for some \( k \).

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - If \( n \) is in the first \( k \) positions, \( n \) should be in the range \( 1 \leq n \leq k \) and \( x \) should be \( n \).
   - If \( n \) is in the next \( k-2 \) positions, \( n \) should be in the range \( k+1 \leq n \leq 2k-2 \) and \( x \) should be \( 2k - n \).

4. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - We need to find \( k \) such that \( n \) and \( x \) satisfy the above conditions.
   - This can be broken down into two cases:
     - Case 1: \( n \leq k \) and \( x = n \).
     - Case 2: \( k < n \leq 2k-2 \) and \( x = 2k - n \).

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \)
     - \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \)
   - For each condition, it calls `func_1` to find the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) respectively.
   - It then checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \( x \), and appends them to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list and prints the length of the list.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of a given number \( x \).
   - It iterates from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \) and checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( i \).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( i \), it adds both \( i \) and \( \frac{x}{i} \) to the list of divisors.
   - It then reverses the list of smaller divisors and appends them to the list of larger divisors.

7. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It correctly checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \( x \).
   - The logic for checking the conditions and appending the valid \( k \) values to the `output` list is correct.
   - The final step of removing duplicates and printing the length of the `output` list is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values for the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
