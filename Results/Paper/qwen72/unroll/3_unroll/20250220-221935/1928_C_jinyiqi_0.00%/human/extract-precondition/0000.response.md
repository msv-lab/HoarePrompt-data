It seems there is a mismatch in the function definition provided and the problem description. The problem description involves two parameters, `n` and `x`, while the function definition only includes one parameter, `x`. Based on the problem description, the correct function definition should include both `n` and `x`. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def count_possible_ks(n, x):
```

Precondition: **n and x are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.**
