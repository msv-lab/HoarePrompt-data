The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` must start at 1 and increment up to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `q` is an input integer (not used in the loop head)
- `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers provided in the input (not used in the loop head)
- `c` is a list of positive integers (not used in the loop head)
- `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are `0` (not used in the loop head)

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must start at 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
