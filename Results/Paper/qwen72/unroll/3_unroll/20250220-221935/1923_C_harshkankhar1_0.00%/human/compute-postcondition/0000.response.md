Output State: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The array `c` is a list of positive integers, and the number of queries `q` is a non-negative integer. Each query is a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)` where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the array `c`. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed `3 * 10^5`. `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**
