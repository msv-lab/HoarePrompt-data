The function `func_1` processes an array `a` of positive integers and a number of queries `q`. It computes a cumulative sum array `b` based on the condition that each element in `a` is either 1 or 2 (1 if the element is greater than 1, otherwise 2). It then modifies `a` to be its own cumulative sum array. For each query `(x, y)`, the function prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in the subarray `a[x:y]` is greater than or equal to the corresponding sum in `b[x:y]` and `x != y`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries. After the function concludes, `a` is a list of cumulative sums of its original values, and `b` is a list of cumulative sums based on the condition `a[i] > 1`.
