#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the array `c`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. The array `c` is a list of positive integers, and the number of queries `q` is a non-negative integer. Each query is a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)` where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the array `c`. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed `3 * 10^5`.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of `1` or `2` based on the condition `a[i] > 1` starting from `b[0] = 0`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: 1 3 6 10 (where the values are the cumulative sums of the original values of list `a`)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` is now a list of cumulative sums of its original values, `c` remains the same, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of `1` or `2` based on the condition `a[i] > 1` starting from `b[0] = 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes an array `a` of positive integers and a number of queries `q`. It computes a cumulative sum array `b` based on the condition that each element in `a` is either 1 or 2 (1 if the element is greater than 1, otherwise 2). It then modifies `a` to be its own cumulative sum array. For each query `(x, y)`, the function prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in the subarray `a[x:y]` is greater than or equal to the corresponding sum in `b[x:y]` and `x != y`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries. After the function concludes, `a` is a list of cumulative sums of its original values, and `b` is a list of cumulative sums based on the condition `a[i] > 1`.
