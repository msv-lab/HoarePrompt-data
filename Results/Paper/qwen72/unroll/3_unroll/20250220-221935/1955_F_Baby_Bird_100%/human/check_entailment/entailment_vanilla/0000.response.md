### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative.

3. **XOR of Numbers 1 to 4:**
   - \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)
   - \( 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \)
   - \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
   - \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 1 \)

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.
   - To achieve this, Eve can pair numbers that XOR to zero and remove them in pairs. If there is an odd number of a certain type, she can leave one unpaired to ensure the XOR is non-zero.

5. **Counting Pairs:**
   - For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), Eve can remove pairs of the same number.
   - The number of pairs for each type is \( \text{count} // 2 \).
   - If there is an odd count, she can leave one unpaired.

6. **Combining Pairs:**
   - The total number of pairs that can be removed is the sum of pairs for each type.
   - Each pair removal results in a win for Bob.
   - The formula used in the program is \( \text{sum}(3 * (x // 2) + x \% 2 * (i < 3)) // 3 \).

7. **Explanation of the Formula:**
   - \( 3 * (x // 2) \) counts the number of pairs that can be removed for each type.
   - \( x \% 2 * (i < 3) \) ensures that if there is an odd count, it is considered only for the first three types (1, 2, 3).
   - The division by 3 at the end is to account for the fact that each pair removal results in a win for Bob.

8. **Verification:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It splits the input into four integers representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - It calculates the number of pairs and the potential unpaired numbers and sums them up.
   - The result is divided by 3 to get the maximum number of wins for Bob.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The formula and the approach are consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
