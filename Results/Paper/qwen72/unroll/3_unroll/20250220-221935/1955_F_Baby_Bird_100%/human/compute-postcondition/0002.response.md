Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200). The function reads the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 10,000) from user input and then, for each test case, reads four integers from user input. It computes a value based on these integers and prints the result for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the computed results have been printed to the console. **
