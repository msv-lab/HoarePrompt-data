### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative.

3. **XOR of Numbers 1 to 4:**
   - \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)
   - \( 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \)
   - \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
   - \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 1 \)

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.
   - To achieve this, Eve can pair numbers that XOR to zero and remove them in pairs. If there is an odd number of a certain type, she can leave one unpaired to ensure the XOR is non-zero.

5. **Counting Pairs:**
   - For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), Eve can remove pairs of the same number.
   - The number of pairs for each type is \( \text{count} // 2 \).
   - If there is an odd count, she can leave one unpaired.

6. **Combining Pairs:**
   - The total number of pairs that can be removed is the sum of pairs for each type.
   - Each pair removal results in a win for Bob.
   - The formula used in the program is \( \text{sum}(3 * (x // 2) + x \% 2 * (i < 3)) // 3 \).

7. **Explanation of the Formula:**
   - \( 3 * (x // 2) \) counts the number of pairs that can be removed for each type.
   - \( x \% 2 * (i < 3) \) ensures that if there is an odd count, it is considered only for the first three types (1, 2, 3).
   - The division by 3 at the end is to account for the fact that each pair removal results in a win for Bob.

8. **Verification:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It splits the input into four integers representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - It calculates the number of pairs and the potential unpaired numbers and sums them up.
   - The result is divided by 3 to get the maximum number of wins for Bob.

### Detailed Analysis of the Program:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.

- **Pair Calculation:**
  - The expression \( 3 * (x // 2) \) correctly calculates the number of pairs for each type of number.
  - The expression \( x \% 2 * (i < 3) \) correctly handles the odd counts for the first three types (1, 2, 3).

- **Sum and Division:**
  - The sum of the pairs and the potential unpaired numbers is divided by 3 to get the maximum number of wins for Bob.
  - This division by 3 is correct because each pair removal results in a win for Bob.

### Annotated Code Analysis:

```python
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    # This is printed: 22
    # 12
```

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \le t \le 10^4 \).
  - Each of the four integers \( p_i \) in the test cases is an integer such that \( 0 \le p_i \le 200 \).

- **Function Execution:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) using `int(input())`.
  - For each test case, it reads four integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
  - It calculates the number of pairs and the potential unpaired numbers using the formula \( 3 * (x // 2) + x \% 2 * (i < 3) \).
  - It sums these values and divides by 3 to get the maximum number of wins for Bob.
  - The result is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The formula and the approach are consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
