Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the road should be laid before the first house (i.e., output 0) correctly. According to the problem description, if the road is laid before the first house, the entire village should be considered the right side, and at least half of the residents should want to live on the right side. However, the program does not check this condition explicitly and always starts the road after the first house, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
000
```
The correct output should be 0 because the road should be laid before the first house to satisfy the condition that at least half of the residents want to live on the right side. However, the program will output 3, which is incorrect.
