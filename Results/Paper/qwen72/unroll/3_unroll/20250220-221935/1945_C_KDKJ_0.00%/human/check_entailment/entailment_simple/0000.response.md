### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.
   - This is correctly handled by `func_2()`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - `func_1()` reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.
   - It then constructs a prefix sum list `S` where `S[i]` contains the number of '0's and '1's from the start of the string up to the `i-1`-th character.
   - This is correctly implemented, and `S` is built as expected.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program iterates over each possible position `i` to place the road.
   - For each position, it calculates the number of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the total number of houses on the left side (`left * 2 >= lsum`).
   - It also checks if the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the total number of houses on the right side (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
   - These conditions are correctly implemented.

4. **Optimal Position Selection:**
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program checks if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village (`n / 2`) than the previously stored position `ans`.
   - If it is, `ans` is updated to the current position `i`.
   - This ensures that the road is placed as close to the middle as possible while satisfying the conditions.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the optimal position `ans` for each test case.
   - This is correctly handled by the `print(ans)` statement.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given conditions. It handles multiple test cases and ensures that the road is placed as close to the middle of the village as possible while satisfying the conditions.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
