You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
        print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of integers from the user. It then determines and prints the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. If `n` is 2, it prints 2. Otherwise, it checks a specific condition involving the best friends' relationships in the list `p`. If the condition is met for any friend, it prints 2 and returns. If the condition is not met for any friend, it prints 3. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually using a loop.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.

3. **Special Case for n = 2**: If there are only 2 friends, the program correctly prints 2 because both friends must be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **Cycle Detection**: The program attempts to detect cycles of length 3 in the best friend relationships. If a cycle of length 3 is found (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`), it prints 2 and returns. This is based on the idea that if there is a cycle of length 3, inviting any two friends in the cycle will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

5. **Default Case**: If no cycle of length 3 is found, the program prints 3. This is a default case, but it is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `v = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. Here, there is a cycle of length 4, and inviting any 3 friends will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. However, the program will print 3, which is correct in this case but not necessarily optimal.

6. **Missing Cases**: The program does not handle other possible cycles or structures in the best friend relationships. For example, if there are multiple cycles of length 2, the program will print 3, which is not the minimum number of invitations needed.

7. **General Solution**: The correct approach should be to find the smallest cycle or the smallest set of friends that can be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. This involves more complex graph traversal or cycle detection algorithms, which the given program does not implement.

Given these points, the program is not correct for all possible inputs. It fails to handle cases where the optimal solution is not a cycle of length 3.
