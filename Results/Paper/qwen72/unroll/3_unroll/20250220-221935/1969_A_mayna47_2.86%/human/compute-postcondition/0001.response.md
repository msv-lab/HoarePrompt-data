Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros.** 

The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, inclusive. The code initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. Therefore, `v` is now a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The other conditions and variables in the initial state remain unchanged.
