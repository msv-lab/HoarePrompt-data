Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it is no longer beautiful. A beautiful array is defined as one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` when `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

However, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Consecutive Elements**:
   - The program uses a variable `same` to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - It updates `minn` with the minimum length of consecutive elements found.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not consider the requirement to stop the array from being beautiful. The minimum length of consecutive elements is not necessarily the minimum number of elements to remove to achieve this goal.

2. **Handling Arrays with All Elements the Same**:
   - The program correctly identifies that if all elements are the same, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, and it prints `-1`.
   - However, it does not handle other cases correctly.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To make an array not beautiful, you need to ensure that there is no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
   - One way to achieve this is to remove elements such that the array no longer has any such index `i`.
   - The program should check for the presence of such indices and determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break all such patterns.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the array `[2, 2, 2]`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful.
   - For the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program prints `1`, which is correct because removing the last `1` makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.
   - For the array `[1]`, the program correctly prints `-1` because a single-element array is trivially beautiful and cannot be made not beautiful.
   - For the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program prints `3`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `2` because removing the first two `3`s or the last two `3`s will make the array not beautiful.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
