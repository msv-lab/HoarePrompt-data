### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).
   - If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful, we output -1.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( ar \).
   - It initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It iterates through the array to count the length of consecutive segments of the same element.
   - It updates `minn` with the minimum length of these segments.
   - If `minn` remains `inf` (i.e., no segments were found), it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Specifically, the program only counts the length of consecutive segments of the same element, but it does not consider the operations that can be performed to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The logic for updating `minn` is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of removing elements to break the beautiful property.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To make the array non-beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no index \( i \) (2 ≤ \( i \) ≤ \( n-1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).
   - One way to achieve this is to remove elements from the array to break the pattern of equal elements at \( a_{i-1} \) and \( a_{i+1} \).
   - The minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the shortest segment of consecutive elements that are the same, minus one (since removing one element from a segment of length 2 or more will break the pattern).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - It only counts the length of consecutive segments but does not consider the operations that can be performed to break the beautiful property.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle the problem as described. It needs to be revised to correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
