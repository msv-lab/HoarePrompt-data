### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
- A beautiful array is one where we can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element at index \(i\) (where \(2 \le i \le |a| - 1\)) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
- If it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, we should output `-1`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `same` is initialized to 1, which counts the length of the current segment of identical elements.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array, which is the current segment's element.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity, which will store the minimum length of any segment of identical elements found.

2. **Loop through the array:**
   - The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, `same` is incremented.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, the loop:
     - Increments `i` to skip the current element.
     - Updates `num` to the new element.
     - Updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
     - Resets `same` to 1 for the new segment.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated to the minimum of `minn` and the last segment's length.
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means there were no segments of different elements, and the array is entirely composed of the same element. In this case, the program outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the program outputs `minn`, which is the minimum length of any segment of identical elements.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where the array has only one unique element and is of length greater than 1.
- For the input:
  ```
  1
  4
  2 2 2 2
  ```
  - The expected output is `-1` because the array will remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed.
  - The program outputs `1`, which is incorrect.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Case 1: Array with all identical elements (e.g., [2, 2, 2, 2]):**
  - The loop will never enter the `else` block because all elements are the same.
  - `minn` will remain infinity.
  - The final check will output `-1`, which is correct.

- **Case 2: Array with segments of identical elements (e.g., [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]):**
  - The loop will enter the `else` block when it encounters a different element.
  - `minn` will be updated to the minimum length of any segment of identical elements.
  - The final check will output the minimum segment length, which is correct.

- **Case 3: Single-element array (e.g., [1]):**
  - The loop will not run because the array length is 1.
  - `minn` will remain infinity.
  - The final check will output `-1`, which is correct.

- **Case 4: Mixed segments (e.g., [3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]):**
  - The loop will enter the `else` block when it encounters the different element `5`.
  - `minn` will be updated to the minimum segment length, which is 3.
  - The final check will output `3`, which is correct.

#### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one unique element and is of length greater than 1.
- The program outputs `-1` for such cases, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True** (The given program is correct.)
