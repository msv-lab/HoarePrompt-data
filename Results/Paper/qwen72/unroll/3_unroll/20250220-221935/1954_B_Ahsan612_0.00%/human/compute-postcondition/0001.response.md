Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, processes the array, and prints the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `ar` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed. The final state of the loop is that all test cases have been processed, and the output for each test case has been printed.**
