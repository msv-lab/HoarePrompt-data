Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has only one unique element and is of length greater than 1. For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
2 2 2 2
```
The expected output should be `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements, as all elements are the same and the array will remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed. However, the program will output `1`, which is incorrect.
