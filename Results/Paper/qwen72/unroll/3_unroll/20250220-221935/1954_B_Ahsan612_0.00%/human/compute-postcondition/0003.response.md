Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it finds the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same in the array and prints this value. If no such consecutive elements exist, it prints `-1`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with all test cases having been processed and their respective results printed. **
