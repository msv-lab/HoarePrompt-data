Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining if a template exists such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
In this case, there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not. One such template is `ABC`. For `a` and `b`, each character in the template is uppercase, and the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template. However, for `c`, all characters match the lowercase version of the template, so `c` does not match the template. The program, however, incorrectly outputs `NO` because it does not correctly handle the case where `a` and `b` have different characters at the same position, and `c` has a character that matches one of them.
