### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Conditions:**
   - A string `s` matches the template `t` if:
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is lowercase, then `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is uppercase, then `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

3. **Conditions to Check:**
   - The goal is to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
     - Both `a` and `b` match the template.
     - `c` does not match the template.

4. **Logic Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, then the template `t[i]` must be the lowercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
     - For `c` to not match the template, `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
     - If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, then it is possible to construct a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

   - **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, then the template `t[i]` can be either the lowercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
     - For `c` to not match the template, `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
     - If `c[i]` is the same as either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then it is not possible to construct a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

5. **Implementation:**
   - The function iterates through each position `i` of the strings.
   - It checks the conditions for each position:
     - If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is the same as either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, it continues to the next position.
     - If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same length and contain only lowercase letters.
   - It correctly identifies when `a` and `b` can be matched to a template and `c` cannot.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The conditions and edge cases are handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
