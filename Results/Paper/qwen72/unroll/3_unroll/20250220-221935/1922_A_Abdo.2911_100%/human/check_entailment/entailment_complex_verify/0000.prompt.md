You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Annotated Code: 
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take four parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        possible = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                continue
            else:
                possible = True
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `t` times, and for each test case, it will have checked the conditions specified in the loop body. If the conditions for a test case result in `possible` being `True`, it will print 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it will print 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their values after each iteration, but their values will be overwritten in subsequent iterations. After all iterations, `t` will be the same as the initial input, and `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if there is any position `i` in the strings such that `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain the values from the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining if a template exists such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
In this case, there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not. One such template is `ABC`. For `a` and `b`, each character in the template is uppercase, and the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template. However, for `c`, all characters match the lowercase version of the template, so `c` does not match the template. The program, however, incorrectly outputs `NO` because it does not correctly handle the case where `a` and `b` have different characters at the same position, and `c` has a character that matches one of them.
