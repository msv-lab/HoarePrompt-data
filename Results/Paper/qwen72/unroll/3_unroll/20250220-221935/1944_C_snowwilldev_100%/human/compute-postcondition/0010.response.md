Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `a` from user input. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a `defaultdict` named `cnt`. The function iterates through the range from 0 to `N` inclusive, and returns the first integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `0` or the second integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `1`. If neither condition is met, it returns `N + 1`. The function does not handle multiple test cases or validate the input range as described in the comments. **
