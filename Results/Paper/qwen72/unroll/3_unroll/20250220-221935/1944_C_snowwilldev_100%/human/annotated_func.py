#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i < n for each element a_i in the list `a`. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: The variable `a` remains unchanged. The variable `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`. The variables `N`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: The loop returns the first integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `0` or the second integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `1`. If neither condition is met, it returns `N + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `a` from user input. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a `defaultdict` named `cnt`. The function iterates through the range from 0 to `N` inclusive, and returns the first integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `0` or the second integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `1`. If neither condition is met, it returns `N + 1`. The function does not handle multiple test cases or validate the input range as described in the comments.
