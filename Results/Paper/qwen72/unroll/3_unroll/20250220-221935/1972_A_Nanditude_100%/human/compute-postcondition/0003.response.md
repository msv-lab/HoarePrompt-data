The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and `b` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. `t` and `n` are positive integers, and `a` and `b` are lists of `n` integers each, sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
