The only variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `left <= right`. 

Right before the loop, `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `right` will be at least 1 (when `n` is 2) and at most 99 (when `n` is 100). Since `left` is 0 and `right` is at least 1, the condition `left <= right` is already satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is n - 1**
