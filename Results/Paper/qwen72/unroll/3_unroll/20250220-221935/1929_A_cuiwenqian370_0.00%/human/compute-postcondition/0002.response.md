Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0.** 

The variable `left` is now set to 0, while the other variables (`n`, `arr`, and `new_arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
