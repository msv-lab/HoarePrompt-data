Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the maximum profit Bob can obtain. The function `func_1` is used to determine if a certain `k` value is valid, but the logic inside `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` does not ensure that the profit is maximized. Instead, it only checks if the profit is less than or equal to the maximum possible profit if all buns were sold at the higher of the two prices, which is not the correct condition for maximizing profit.

A correct approach would involve calculating the profit for each possible value of `k` and selecting the maximum profit. The current binary search approach and the `func_1` function do not achieve this.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 4 5
```
The correct output should be `17`, as explained in the problem description. However, the given program will output `4`, which is incorrect.

The correct logic should be:
1. Calculate the profit for each possible `k` from `0` to `min(n, b)`.
2. Return the maximum profit among all possible `k` values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k)) + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This version iterates over all possible values of `k` and calculates the profit for each, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.
