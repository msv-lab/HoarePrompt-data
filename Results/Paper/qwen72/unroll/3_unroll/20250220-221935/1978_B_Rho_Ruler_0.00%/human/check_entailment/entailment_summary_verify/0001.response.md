### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The program initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n`. This is appropriate because the value of `k` can range from 0 to `n`.

3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The program uses a binary search to find the optimal value of `k`. The loop condition `while low <= high` is correct for a binary search.

4. **Mid Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the midpoint `mid` as `(low + high) // 2`, which is the standard way to find the midpoint in a binary search.

5. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` to check if the current midpoint `mid` is a valid candidate for `k`.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the profit for selling `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
   - The profit for the first `k` buns is calculated as `k * b`.
   - The profit for the remaining `n - k` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
   - The function returns `True` if the total profit `ans` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This condition is intended to ensure that the profit does not exceed the maximum possible profit, but it is not necessary for finding the maximum profit.

7. **Updating `ans` and Search Range**:
   - If `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` returns `True`, the program updates `ans` to `mid` and moves the search range to the right by setting `low = mid + 1`.
   - If `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` returns `False`, the program moves the search range to the left by setting `high = mid - 1`.

8. **Output**:
   - After the binary search loop, the program prints the value of `ans`.

### Critical Issues:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The condition `return ans <= n * max(a, b)` is not the correct way to determine if the current `k` is optimal. This condition is always true because `ans` is a valid profit for some `k`, and `n * max(a, b)` is the maximum possible profit if all buns are sold at the higher of the two prices.
  - The function should instead return the profit directly, and the main loop should compare the profits to find the maximum.

- **Binary Search Logic**:
  - The binary search logic is flawed because it does not correctly identify the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. The binary search should be used to find the `k` that gives the maximum profit, not to check if the profit is within a certain range.

### Corrected Version:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        low = 0
        high = min(n, b)  # k should be between 0 and min(n, b)
        max_profit = -1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            current_profit = func_1(mid, a, b, n)
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
            if func_2(mid, a, b, n):
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        print(max_profit)

def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    ans = 0
    if k > 0:
        ans += (b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2)  # Sum of the first k modified prices
    ans += (n - k) * a  # Sum of the remaining buns at the usual price
    return ans

def func_2(k, a, b, n):
    # Check if increasing k will increase the profit
    current_profit = func_1(k, a, b, n)
    next_profit = func_1(k + 1, a, b, n)
    return next_profit > current_profit
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Version:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - This function now correctly calculates the profit for a given `k`:
    - For the first `k` buns, the profit is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
    - For the remaining `n - k` buns, the profit is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function checks if increasing `k` by 1 will result in a higher profit. This is used to guide the binary search.

- **Main Loop**:
  - The main loop updates `max_profit` to the maximum profit found during the binary search.
  - The search range is adjusted based on the result of `func_2`.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the function `func_1` and the binary search logic. The original program does not correctly determine the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit, and the function `func_1` is flawed in its return condition.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
