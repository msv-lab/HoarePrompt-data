Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each test case, a Hamiltonian path has been constructed and printed in the format `! path`, where `path` is a space-separated list of integers representing the vertices in the Hamiltonian path. The variables `vx` and `ops` are reset for each new test case, and their final state is not retained between test cases.**
