The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates in an interactive environment where the graph is defined by the interactor. The graph is a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices, from which exactly `(n - 2)` edges have been removed. The function can make up to `n` queries to the interactor to find a Hamiltonian path. The function returns a Hamiltonian path if one exists.

Functionality: **The function operates in an interactive environment to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph with `n` vertices and `(n - 2)` removed edges, using up to `n` queries. It returns a Hamiltonian path if one exists.**
