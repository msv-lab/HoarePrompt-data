Functionality: ** The function `func` operates in an interactive environment to find and print a Hamiltonian path in a graph with `n` vertices and `(n - 2)` removed edges. It processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). For each test case, the function queries the interactor to construct the Hamiltonian path and prints it in the format `! path`, where `path` is a space-separated list of integers representing the vertices in the path. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is that all Hamiltonian paths have been printed for the given test cases. **
