Output State: **The function `q` is defined as a lambda function that prints a query to the interactor in the format `? d` where `d` is an integer, and then reads and returns a list of integers from the interactor's response. The graph is a complete undirected graph with n vertices, from which exactly (n - 2) edges have been removed. The function can make up to n queries to the interactor to find a Hamiltonian path. Each test case is defined by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
