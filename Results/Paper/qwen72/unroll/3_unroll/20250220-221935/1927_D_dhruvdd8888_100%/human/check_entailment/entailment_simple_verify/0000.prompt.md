You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to read input from stdin and process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. The array `a` has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The number of queries `q` for each test case is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5). Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

    #State: The values of `nums`, `N`, `num`, `s`, `e`, `arr`, and `LA` remain unchanged. The loop prints a series of tuples or pairs of `-1, -1` based on the input ranges and the conditions within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `[l, r]` is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

In the third query (1 3), the expected output is `1 3` because `a_1 = 1` and `a_3 = 2`, which are different. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1 -1`.

The issue lies in the way the program handles the `arr` list and the conditions for checking the indices. The program does not correctly account for all possible pairs within the range `[l, r]` and may miss valid pairs.
