The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept parameters in its definition. However, it is expected to read input from stdin, which includes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. The array `a` has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The number of queries `q` for each test case is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5). Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function processes each query and returns the result of the query for each test case.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from stdin, each containing an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. For each query defined by two integers `l` and `r`, the function returns a result based on the elements of the array `a` between indices `l` and `r`.**
