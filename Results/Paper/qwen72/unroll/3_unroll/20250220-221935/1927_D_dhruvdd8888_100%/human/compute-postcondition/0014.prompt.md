You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to read input from stdin and process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. The array `a` has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The number of queries `q` for each test case is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5). Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: `nums` remains unchanged, `N` remains unchanged, `num` is the last element of `nums` (which is `-1`), `s` is the index of the last element of `nums` (which is `N`), `e` remains 0, `arr` contains tuples representing the start and end indices of each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`, excluding the last `-1`.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The values of `nums`, `N`, `num`, `s`, `e`, `arr`, and `LA` remain unchanged. The loop prints a series of tuples or pairs of `-1, -1` based on the input ranges and the conditions within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from stdin, each containing an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. For each query defined by two integers `l` and `r`, the function returns a result based on the elements of the array `a` between indices `l` and `r`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
