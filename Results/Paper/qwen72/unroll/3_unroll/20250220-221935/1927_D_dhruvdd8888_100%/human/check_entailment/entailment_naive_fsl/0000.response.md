Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `[l, r]` is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

In the third query (1 3), the expected output is `1 3` because `a_1 = 1` and `a_3 = 2`, which are different. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1 -1`.

The issue lies in the way the program handles the `arr` list and the conditions for checking the indices. The program does not correctly account for all possible pairs within the range `[l, r]` and may miss valid pairs.
