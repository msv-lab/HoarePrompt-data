The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `nums`.

Given the initial state:
- The function `func_1` is expected to read input from stdin and process multiple test cases.
- Each test case includes an array `a` of integers and a series of queries.
- The array `a` has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).
- The number of queries `q` for each test case is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n).
- The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- The `input` variable is now set to the function `sys.stdin.readline`, which reads a line from standard input.
- `N` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.

After executing the code snippet:
- `nums` is assigned a list of integers read from the input.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
