Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `N` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `num` is the first element of `nums`, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, the function `func_1` is expected to read input from stdin and process multiple test cases, each test case includes an array `a` of integers and a series of queries, the array `a` has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), the number of queries `q` for each test case is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5), each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n), the sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, the `input` variable is set to the function `sys.stdin.readline` which reads a line from standard input.**
