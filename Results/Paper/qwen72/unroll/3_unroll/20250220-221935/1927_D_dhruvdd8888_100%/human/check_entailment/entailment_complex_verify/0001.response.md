### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` itself.
   - It initializes variables `s`, `e`, and `num` to keep track of the start of a segment, the end of a segment, and the current number, respectively.
   - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the last segment correctly.
   - It iterates through the array and groups consecutive identical numbers into segments, storing the start and end indices of each segment along with the number in the list `arr`.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of queries and processes each query.
   - For each query, it uses `bisect_left` to find the first segment that starts at or after the query's left boundary `l`.
   - It then checks the start and end indices of the segment to determine if a valid pair of indices `i` and `j` can be found within the query range `[l, r]`.

4. **Conditions for Valid Pairs:**
   - **Condition 1: `if s > l`**
     - This condition checks if the start of the segment `s` is greater than the left boundary `l`.
     - If `s` is 1 or greater than `r`, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair found).
     - Otherwise, it prints `s-1` and `s` (valid pair found).
     - **Issue:** This condition is not sufficient to ensure that the segment starts within the query range. It should also check if `s` is within the range `[l, r]`.

   - **Condition 2: `elif e >= r`**
     - This condition checks if the end of the segment `e` is greater than or equal to the right boundary `r`.
     - If so, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair found).
     - **Issue:** This condition should be `elif e < r` to ensure that the segment ends within the query range. The current condition is incorrect because it will print `-1 -1` even if the segment ends before `r`.

   - **Condition 3: `elif e < N or e < l`**
     - This condition checks if the end of the segment `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`.
     - If so, it prints `s` and `e+1` (valid pair found).
     - **Issue:** This condition is redundant and can be simplified. It should only check if `e < r` to ensure the segment ends before `r`.

   - **Condition 4: `else`**
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair found).
     - **Issue:** This condition is correct but might be reached due to the incorrect logic in the previous conditions.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
- For the query `(1, 2)` in the array `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`, the program should output `-1 -1` because there are no different elements in the range `[1, 2]`. However, the program might output a valid pair due to incorrect boundary checks.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program has logical errors in the conditions used to determine valid pairs of indices, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases. Specifically, the conditions for checking segment boundaries are flawed, which can result in incorrect pairs being printed or valid pairs being missed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
