You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes it to extract multiple test cases, and calls another function `func_1` with these test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, and `arr` is a list of integers. The function then prints each result returned by `func_1` to the console. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input data is processed, and the results of `func_1` are printed to the console.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (func_2):**
   - The function reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It then parses the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it parses the next two lines to get `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It appends these values as a tuple to the `test_cases` list.
   - This part of the code correctly handles the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Processing Each Test Case (func_1):**
   - The function initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It iterates through each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y`.
     - If the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The key idea is to use the properties of modular arithmetic to determine if a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful.
   - For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful, both \(a_i + a_j\) and \(a_i - a_j\) must be divisible by `x` and `y` respectively.
   - The condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\), which is why we calculate `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`.
   - The condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\), which is why we calculate `ry` as `a % y`.
   - By storing the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`, we can efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the constraints \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), \(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), and \(1 \le x, y \le 10^9\) correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `x` and `y` can be equal.
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), which is managed by the input handling and the algorithm.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described. It correctly identifies and counts the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
