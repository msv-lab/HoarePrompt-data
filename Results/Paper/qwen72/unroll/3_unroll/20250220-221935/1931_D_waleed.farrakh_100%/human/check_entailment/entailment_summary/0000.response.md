### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** A list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - **Output:** A list `results` where each element is the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - **Behavior:**
     - The function iterates over each test case.
     - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
     - It also initializes a counter `count` to count the number of beautiful pairs.
     - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
       - `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
       - `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
     - If the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary, it increments the `count` by the frequency of that pair.
     - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
     - Finally, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** Standard input from the user.
   - **Output:** Prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Behavior:**
     - The function reads all input from stdin and splits it into lines.
     - It extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
     - It processes each test case by reading the next two lines: the first line contains `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line contains the array `arr`.
     - It appends each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
     - It calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list and prints each result to the console.

3. **Verification:**
   - **Input Parsing:** `func_2` correctly parses the input and constructs the `test_cases` list.
   - **Beautiful Pairs Calculation:** `func_1` correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each test case by using the remainders `rx` and `ry` to check the conditions for divisibility by `x` and `y`.
   - **Output:** `func_2` correctly prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The functions handle the constraints provided in the problem statement, including the range of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the elements of `arr`.
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the case where there are no beautiful pairs in a test case (e.g., the second test case in the example).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets the problem description and handles the input and output as specified. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to solve the problem efficiently and accurately.

Correctness: **True**
