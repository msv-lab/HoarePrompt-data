Output State: **None of the variables are used in the function signature of `func_2`. The function reads input from stdin, processes it to extract test cases, and calls another function `func_1` with the processed test cases.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet only reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`, which does not change the initial state of the variables. The function `func_2` still reads input from stdin, processes it to extract test cases, and calls `func_1` with the processed test cases. No variables are explicitly defined or modified in the given code snippet, so the initial state remains unchanged.
