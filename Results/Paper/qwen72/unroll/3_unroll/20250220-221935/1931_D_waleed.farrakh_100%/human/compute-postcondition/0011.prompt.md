You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are used in the function signature of `func_2`. The function reads input from stdin, processes it to extract test cases, and calls another function `func_1` with the processed test cases.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        
        idx += 2
        
    #State: `t` is the integer value of the first string in `data`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers from the corresponding line in `data`, and `arr` is a list of integers from the next line in `data`. `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`.
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` remains the same, `test_cases` remains the same, `idx` remains the same, and `results` has been fully iterated over, with each element printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input from stdin, processes it to extract test cases, and calls `func_1` with the extracted test cases. It does not return any value.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
