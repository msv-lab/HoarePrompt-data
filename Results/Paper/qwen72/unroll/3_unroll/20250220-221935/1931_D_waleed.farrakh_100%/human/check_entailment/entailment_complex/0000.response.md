### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: The function `func_1` takes a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - **Processing**:
     - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
     - It iterates through the array `arr` and calculates the remainders `rx` and `ry` for each element `a`:
       - `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x`, which ensures that `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x` and is always non-negative.
       - `ry` is calculated as `a % y`, which is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
     - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it adds the count of this pair to the total count of beautiful pairs.
     - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - **Output**: The function returns a list `results` containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: The function `func_2` reads input from stdin, which is expected to be formatted as described in the problem statement.
   - **Processing**:
     - It reads the first line to determine the number of test cases `t`.
     - It then reads the next `t` pairs of lines, each pair containing `n`, `x`, `y` and the array `arr`.
     - It constructs a list of test cases and calls `func_1` with this list.
     - Finally, it prints the results returned by `func_1` to the console.
   - **Output**: The function prints the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the console.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Test Case Handling**: The function `func_2` correctly processes the input to create the list of test cases and calls `func_1` with this list.
   - **Beautiful Pairs Calculation**:
     - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies pairs `(a_i, a_j)` such that `(a_i + a_j)` is divisible by `x` and `(a_i - a_j)` is divisible by `y`.
     - The use of remainders and the frequency dictionary ensures that the pairs are counted efficiently.
   - **Output**: The results are printed correctly for each test case.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.
