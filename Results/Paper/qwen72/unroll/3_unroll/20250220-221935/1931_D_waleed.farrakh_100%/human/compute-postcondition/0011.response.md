Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes it to extract multiple test cases, and calls another function `func_1` with these test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, and `arr` is a list of integers. The function then prints each result returned by `func_1` to the console. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input data is processed, and the results of `func_1` are printed to the console. **
