To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is the integer value of the first string in `data`.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
- `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`.
- `results` is the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with `test_cases` as its argument.

For the loop to execute, `results` must be an iterable with at least one element. If `results` is empty, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `results`.

State: **`t` is the integer value of the first string in `data`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` must be an iterable with at least one element, `result` is the first element in `results`**
