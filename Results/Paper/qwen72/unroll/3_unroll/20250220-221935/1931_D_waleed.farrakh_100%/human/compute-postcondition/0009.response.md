To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop, let's break down the initial state and the loop:

### Initial State:
- `t` is the integer value of the first string in `data`.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers from the corresponding line in `data`, and `arr` is a list of integers from the next line in `data`.
- `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`.
- `results` is the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with `test_cases` as its argument.

### Loop:
```python
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.
- For each `result` in `results`, the `print(result)` statement is executed, which prints the value of `result` to the console.
- The loop does not modify any variables other than the loop variable `result`.

### Output State:
- After the loop has finished executing, the `results` list will have been fully iterated over, and each element in `results` will have been printed to the console.
- The variables `t`, `test_cases`, and `idx` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` remains the same, `test_cases` remains the same, `idx` remains the same, and `results` has been fully iterated over, with each element printed to the console.**
