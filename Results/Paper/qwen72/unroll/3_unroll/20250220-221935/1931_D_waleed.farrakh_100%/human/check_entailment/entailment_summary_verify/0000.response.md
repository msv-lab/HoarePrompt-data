### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `stdin` and processes it to extract multiple test cases.
   - It correctly splits the input into lines and extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and `y` from the next line and the array `arr` from the line after that.
   - It appends each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - The function then calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints each result to the console.
   - The input handling is correct and follows the problem statement's format.

2. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case individually.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` and a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through each element `a` in the array `arr`.
   - It calculates `rx` and `ry` as follows:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This ensures that `rx` is the smallest non-negative integer such that `a + a_j` is divisible by `x` for some `a_j`.
     - `ry = a % y`: This ensures that `ry` is the smallest non-negative integer such that `a - a_j` is divisible by `y` for some `a_j`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary `freq`. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the counter `count`.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - After processing all elements, it appends the counter `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is the correct remainder when `a` is negated and adjusted to be non-negative.
   - The use of `a % y` ensures that `ry` is the correct remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - By checking if `(rx, ry)` is in the frequency dictionary, the function correctly identifies pairs that satisfy the conditions.
   - The frequency dictionary is updated with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` to keep track of the occurrences of each pair.
   - The logic handles all edge cases, including when the array is empty or contains only one element, as the frequency dictionary will not find any pairs to count in such cases.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Empty Array:** If `arr` is empty, the loop will not run, and `count` will remain 0, which is the correct result.
   - **Single Element Array:** If `arr` contains only one element, the loop will run once, and `count` will remain 0, which is the correct result.
   - **Multiple Test Cases:** The function correctly processes multiple test cases and returns the results for each one.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case, and it handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
