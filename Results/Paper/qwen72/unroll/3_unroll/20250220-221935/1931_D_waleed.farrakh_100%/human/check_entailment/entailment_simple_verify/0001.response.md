### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It correctly parses the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it parses the next two lines to get `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It appends these values as a tuple to the `test_cases` list.
   - This part of the code is correct and handles the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Processing Each Test Case (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It iterates through each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y`.
     - If the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The key idea is to use the properties of modular arithmetic to determine if a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful.
   - For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful, both \(a_i + a_j\) and \(a_i - a_j\) must be divisible by `x` and `y` respectively.
   - The condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\), which is why we calculate `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`.
   - The condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\), which is why we calculate `ry` as `a % y`.
   - By storing the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`, we can efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the constraints \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), \(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), and \(1 \le x, y \le 10^9\) correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `x` and `y` can be equal.
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), which is managed by the input handling and the algorithm.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The state before `func_1` is called is accurately described: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with the correct format.
- The state after `func_1` is called is also accurately described: `results` contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
- The state within `func_1` is correctly described: `freq` is used to track the frequency of pairs, and `count` is used to count the beautiful pairs.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies and counts the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case, and it handles the input and constraints as specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
