Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the digits are equal. According to the problem description, if all three digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation will incorrectly output "STAIRS" for the input `0 0 0` because the condition `a < b < c` is not strictly checked for inequality. The correct condition should be `a < b and b < c` for a stair and `a < b and b > c` for a peak. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b and b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This version will correctly handle all edge cases, including when the digits are equal.
