The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n_cases`. The loop will execute if `n_cases` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop index and will start at 0. The other states provided (`t`, `n`, and the array `a`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0**
