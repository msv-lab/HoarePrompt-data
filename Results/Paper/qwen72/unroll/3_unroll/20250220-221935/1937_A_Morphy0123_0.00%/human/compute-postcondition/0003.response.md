Functionality: **The function `func` accepts no parameters. It is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving an array `a` of length `n` where `a_i = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. The function returns the result of some operation on the array `a` for each test case.**
