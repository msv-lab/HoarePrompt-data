#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving an array `a` of length `n` where initially `a_i = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. The function will be called multiple times for different values of `n` within a test case, and the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: The loop executes `n_cases` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `n` from the input. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. After all iterations, the variable `n_cases` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` holds the last input value read. The variable `power` holds the last calculated power value, which is the smallest integer such that `2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts no parameters. It reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ n_cases ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. After all test cases have been processed, the function has printed the results for each test case, and the variable `n_cases` remains unchanged. The variable `n` holds the last input value read, and the variable `power` holds the last calculated power value, which is the smallest integer such that `2
