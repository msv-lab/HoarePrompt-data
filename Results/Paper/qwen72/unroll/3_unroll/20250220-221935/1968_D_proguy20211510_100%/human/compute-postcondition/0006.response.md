Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes the number of elements `n`, the duration of the game `k`, the starting positions of Bodya `P_B` and Sasha `P_S`, a permutation list `p`, and a score list `a`. It calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their paths through the permutation and the game duration. After processing, it prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if their scores are equal. The function does not return any values, and the variables `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha` remain unchanged throughout the execution. The state of other variables is reset for each new test case. **
