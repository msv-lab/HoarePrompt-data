Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem description:

1. **Initialization of `YES` and `NO`**: These variables are not used in the program and are unnecessary.

2. **Cycle Detection and Path Calculation**: The program attempts to detect cycles and calculate the path for each player. However, the way it calculates the scores is incorrect. Specifically, the line:
   ```python
   curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
   ```
   This line incorrectly multiplies the score of the current position by the remaining number of turns, which does not accurately reflect the game's rules. The game's rules state that the player either stays at the current position or moves to the next position in the permutation, and the score is incremented by the value at the current position each turn.

3. **Score Calculation**: The program should calculate the score for each player by simulating the game for exactly `k` turns, considering both the option to stay and the option to move. The current implementation does not correctly handle this logic.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, you need to:

1. **Detect Cycles**: Identify the cycle for each player's starting position.
2. **Simulate the Game**: Simulate the game for `k` turns, considering both staying and moving options.
3. **Calculate Scores**: Calculate the scores for each player and determine the winner.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def simulate_game(start):
            score = 0
            position = start
            for _ in range(k):
                score += a[position - 1]
                next_position = p[position - 1]
                if next_position == position:
                    break
                position = next_position
            return score
        
        score_bodya = simulate_game(pb)
        score_sasha = simulate_game(ps)
        
        if score_bodya > score_sasha:
            print('Bodya')
        elif score_sasha > score_bodya:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input as specified.
2. **Simulation Function**: The `simulate_game` function simulates the game for a given starting position. It iterates `k` times, adding the score at the current position and moving to the next position in the permutation. If the player stays at the same position, the loop breaks early.
3. **Score Comparison**: After simulating the game for both players, the program compares their scores and prints the result.

This corrected program should accurately determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description.
