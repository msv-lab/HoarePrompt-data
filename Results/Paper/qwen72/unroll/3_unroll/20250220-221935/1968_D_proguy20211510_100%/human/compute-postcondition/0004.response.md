Output State: **The loop executes all the iterations, and for each test case, it prints either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the calculated scores. The variables `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha` remain unchanged. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres` are updated and used within each iteration but are reset or reinitialized for the next test case.**
