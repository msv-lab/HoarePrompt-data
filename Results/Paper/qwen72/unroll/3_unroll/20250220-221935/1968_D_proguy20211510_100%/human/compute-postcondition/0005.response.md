The function `func` accepts multiple parameters for each test case. For each test case, the parameters are:
- `t`: an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the permutation.
- `k`: an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the duration of the game.
- `P_B`: an integer such that 1 ≤ P_B ≤ n, representing the starting position of Bodya.
- `P_S`: an integer such that 1 ≤ P_S ≤ n, representing the starting position of Sasha.
- `p`: a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, representing the permutation.
- `a`: a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the array of scores.

The function returns the result of the game for each test case, which is not explicitly defined in the provided information. However, based on the context, it is likely that the function returns the final scores or positions of Bodya and Sasha after the game duration `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. It returns the result of the game for each test case, which could be the final scores or positions of Bodya and Sasha after the game duration `k`.**
