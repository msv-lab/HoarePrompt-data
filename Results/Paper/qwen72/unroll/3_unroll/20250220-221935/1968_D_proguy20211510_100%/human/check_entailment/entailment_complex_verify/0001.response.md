### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the path for both Bodya and Sasha from their starting positions.
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - The path is constructed by appending the score at the current position and then moving to the next position in the permutation until a visited position is encountered.
   - This approach is correct and ensures that the path does not get stuck in an infinite loop.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the maximum possible score for each player over `k` turns.
   - It uses a loop to iterate through the path and calculates the score for each turn.
   - The score for each turn is calculated as the cumulative score up to that turn plus the score at the current position multiplied by the remaining turns.
   - The function keeps track of the maximum score for each player.
   - However, there is a subtle issue in the score calculation logic. The formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` assumes that the player will stay at the current position for the remaining turns, which is not always the optimal strategy. The optimal strategy might involve moving to the next position in the permutation, especially if the next position has a higher score.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both players, the function compares them.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater, and "Draw" if they are equal.
   - This part of the function is correct.

### Potential Issues:

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The current score calculation logic is flawed. The formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` assumes that the player will stay at the current position for the remaining turns, which may not be the best strategy.
  - The correct approach should consider the possibility of moving to the next position in the permutation and calculate the score accordingly.
  - For example, if the permutation is `[2, 1]` and the score array is `[10, 1]`, and `k` is 2, the optimal strategy for both players is to move to the next position on the first turn and stay there on the second turn. The current implementation would incorrectly calculate the score by staying at the initial position for both turns.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed score calculation logic. The program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for each player, which can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
