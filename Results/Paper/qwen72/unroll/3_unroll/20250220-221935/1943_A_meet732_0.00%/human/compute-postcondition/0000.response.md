The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop control variable, and the input that determines the number of iterations. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be at least 1. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` do not directly affect the loop head, but they are part of the initial state and should be mentioned as they are relevant to the context of the program.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the input for the loop must be at least 1**
