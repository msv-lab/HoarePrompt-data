### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the element she picks to an array `c` and then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob simply removes the element he picks from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score of the game is the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - We need to find the final score if both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
   - Bob, on the other hand, should try to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c`.
   - The key is to determine the smallest integer `j` that can be excluded from `c` by the end of the game.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.
   - It initializes a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - If `0` does not appear in `a`, the MEX of `c` will be `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer.
   - If `0` appears in `a`, it initializes a variable `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from `1` to `n` and checks if the count of each integer is less than `2`.
   - If the count of an integer `j` is less than `2`, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` is `0` or if `j` is the last integer (`n`). If either condition is met, it prints `j` and breaks the loop.
   - If no such integer is found, it prints `n`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `0` does not appear in `a` by printing `0`.
   - For the case where `0` appears, the program tries to find the smallest integer `j` that can be excluded from `c` by the end of the game.
   - The logic of decrementing `c` and breaking the loop when `c` is `0` or `j` is `n` is correct because it ensures that the smallest possible MEX is found.
   - The program does not modify the input variables and only prints the results, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
