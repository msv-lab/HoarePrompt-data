The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the standard input. It then performs a series of operations to generate a list of numbers and checks if `k` can be reduced to 0. If `k` is 0 after the operations, the function prints 'YES', the length of the list, and the list itself. If `k` is not 0, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results to the standard output.
