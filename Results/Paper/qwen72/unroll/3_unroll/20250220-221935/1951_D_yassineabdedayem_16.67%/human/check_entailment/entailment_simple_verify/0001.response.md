### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel.
   - Alice buys greedily, meaning she buys as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then moves to the next, and so on.
   - The goal is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and if so, provide the number of stalls and the prices.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `rep` (the number of stalls set up) and `number` (the price per jewel for the current stall) to 0.
   - It also initializes an empty list `tab` to store the prices of the stalls.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is not 0, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `Min` and `Max`:
     - `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
     - `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
   - If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and decreases `k` by `Max`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and decreases `k` by `Min`.
   - It appends `number` to `tab` and decreases `n` by `Min * Max`.
   - It increments `rep` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `k` is 0, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices of the stalls.
   - If `k` is not 0, it prints "NO".

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Initialization and Input Handling:**
     - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - **Loop Conditions:**
     - The loop conditions ensure that the program does not exceed the limits of 60 stalls and that Alice has enough coins to buy at least one jewel.
   - **Price Calculation:**
     - The calculation of `Min` and `Max` is intended to ensure that Alice buys as many jewels as possible from the current stall while also ensuring that the total number of jewels bought does not exceed `k`.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The program handles the case where `n` is less than `k` by breaking out of the loop and printing "NO".
     - It also handles the case where `k` is 0 by printing "YES" and the prices of the stalls.

6. **Detailed Evaluation:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - `n = 7`, `k = 3`
     - The program sets up stalls with prices `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`.
     - Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall (2 coins each), and is left with 1 coin, which is not enough to buy any more jewels.
     - The output is "YES" with 10 stalls, which is correct.
   - **Example 2:**
     - `n = 6`, `k = 4`
     - The program sets up stalls with prices `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`.
     - Alice buys 2 jewels from the first stall (3 coins each), and is left with 0 coins.
     - The output is "NO" because Alice cannot buy 4 jewels with only 6 coins.
   - **Example 3:**
     - `n = 255`, `k = 8`
     - The program sets up stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`.
     - Alice buys 1 jewel from each stall, spending 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 coins respectively.
     - The output is "YES" with 8 stalls, which is correct.

7. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic for setting `Min` and `Max` and adjusting `n` and `k` is complex and may not always produce the correct prices.
   - Specifically, the condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k` is not necessary and can be simplified.
   - The program should ensure that `n` is always greater than or equal to `k` before attempting to buy jewels, which it does correctly.

8. **Simplified Approach:**
   - A simpler approach would be to set the price of each stall to `n // k` and ensure that Alice buys exactly one jewel from each stall until `k` is 0.
   - This approach would be more straightforward and easier to verify.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and requirements. However, the logic for setting `Min` and `Max` is overly complex and can be simplified. Despite this, the program does not produce incorrect results for the provided examples and edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
