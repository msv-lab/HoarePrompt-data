The value of `n` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively, with the constraints 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers with the constraints 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is an input integer.**
