### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Initial Check for Identical Elements:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are identical by iterating through the array and setting a flag `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If all elements are identical, the array will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed, so the program correctly prints `-1`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it can find the minimum value.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the number of consecutive elements equal to the first element `val` and updates `ans` with the minimum count of such elements before encountering a different element.
   - Finally, it updates `ans` with the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `flag` is `True`, the program prints `-1` because the array is entirely composed of identical elements.
   - If `flag` is `False`, the program prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removal:**
  - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only considers the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element before a different element is encountered. However, it should consider the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the condition `a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}` for any valid `i`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the array is already not beautiful after removing a single element. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, removing the element at index 4 (0-based) will make the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. It only checks for the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not the correct approach.

### Correctness: **False**
