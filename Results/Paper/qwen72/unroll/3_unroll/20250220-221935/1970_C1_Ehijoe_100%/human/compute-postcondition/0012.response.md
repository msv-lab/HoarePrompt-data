Output State: **`n` remains the same, `t` remains 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key is a node from the input and the value is a list of nodes that are connected to it, `ends` is a list containing all the nodes that have exactly one connection, `s` is the first node in `ends`, `e` is the second node in `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first node in `ends` (`s`), `prev` is the first node in `ends` (`s`).**
