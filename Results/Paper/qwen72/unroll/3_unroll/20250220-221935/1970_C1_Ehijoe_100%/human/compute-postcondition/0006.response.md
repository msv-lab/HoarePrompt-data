Output State: **`n` remains the same, `t` remains 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key is a node from the input and the value is a list of nodes that are connected to it, and `ends` is an empty list.** 

The code snippet initializes the variable `ends` as an empty list, but does not change the values or states of any other variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid, and `ends` is now an empty list.
