The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `n - 1` will always be at least 1, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to 0, and `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `i` is 0**
