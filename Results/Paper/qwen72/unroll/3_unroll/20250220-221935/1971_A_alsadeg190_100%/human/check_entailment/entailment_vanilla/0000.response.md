Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program starts by reading an integer `x` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `x` times, processing each test case.
3. **Reading Test Case Input**: Inside the loop, the program reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` for each test case. This is also consistent with the problem description.
4. **Comparing and Printing**: The program compares `x` and `y`:
   - If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, it prints `y` followed by `x`.
5. **Output Format**: The output format is correct as it prints two integers for each test case, with the minimum value first and the maximum value second.

However, there is a potential issue with variable naming. The variable `x` is used both for the number of test cases and for one of the integers in each test case. This can lead to confusion and potential bugs if the code is modified later. It would be better to use different variable names for clarity.

Despite this, the current implementation is functionally correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
