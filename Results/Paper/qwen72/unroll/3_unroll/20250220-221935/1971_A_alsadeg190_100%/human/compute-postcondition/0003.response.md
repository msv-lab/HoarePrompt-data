Functionality: **The function `func` is called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each iteration, the function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are integers satisfying 0 <= x, y <= 9. The function returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y` for each iteration.**
