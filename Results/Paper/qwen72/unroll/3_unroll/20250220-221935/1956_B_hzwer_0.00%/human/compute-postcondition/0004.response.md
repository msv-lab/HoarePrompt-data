Output State: **The list `a` contains integers from 1 to `n`, and each integer appears at most twice. The integer `n` is the value of the input integer, and the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user. `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) filled with zeros. `dp[n - 1][0]` is 0, and `dp[n - 2][0]` is now 0.**
