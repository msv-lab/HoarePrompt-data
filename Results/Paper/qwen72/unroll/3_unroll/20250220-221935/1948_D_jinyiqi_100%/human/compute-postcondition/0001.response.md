Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to be called with a string `s` as its argument, where `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the total length of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 5000. `s` is now a list of characters from the input string. `n` is the length of the list `s`.**
