You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be called with a string `s` as its argument, where `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the total length of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 5000.
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The loop may print an integer value that is twice the length of the longest substring of `s` which can be repeated consecutively, and then the function returns. If no such substring is found, the loop completes its execution without printing anything, and the function returns without further output. The values of `s`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` and an integer `t`. It processes `t` test cases, where each `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks with a length between 1 and 5000. The function returns a result based on the processing of these strings, ensuring that the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
