Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to be called with a string `s` as its argument, where `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the total length of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 5000.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the string `s` and possibly the number of test cases `t` as parameters. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def func_1(s, t=1):
```

This would allow the function to process the string `s` and, optionally, the number of test cases `t`.
