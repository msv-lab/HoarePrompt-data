#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be called with a string `s` as its argument, where `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the total length of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 5000.
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The loop may print an integer value that is twice the length of the longest substring of `s` which can be repeated consecutively, and then the function returns. If no such substring is found, the loop completes its execution without printing anything, and the function returns without further output. The values of `s`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a single string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It checks for the longest substring within `s` that can be repeated consecutively, considering question marks as wildcards that can match any character. If such a substring is found, it prints the length of this substring multiplied by 2 and then returns. If no such substring is found, it prints `0` and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input string `s` remains unchanged, and the function has printed either a value representing twice the length of the longest repeatable substring or `0`.
