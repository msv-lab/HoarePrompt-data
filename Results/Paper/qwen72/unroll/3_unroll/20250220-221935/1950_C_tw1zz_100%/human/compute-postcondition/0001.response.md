Output State: **The variable `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and the variable `s` remains a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, representing a valid time in 24-hour format. The loop will print the converted time in 12-hour format for each iteration, but the variables `t` and `s` themselves are not modified by the loop.**
