The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from user input. It then calculates the number of groups of four identical integers that can be formed from the list `a` and prints this count. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the program prints the count of such groups.
