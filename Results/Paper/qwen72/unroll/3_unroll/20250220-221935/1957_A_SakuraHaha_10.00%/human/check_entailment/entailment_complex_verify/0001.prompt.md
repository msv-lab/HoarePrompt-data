You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` remains 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 4, `cnt` remains unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 4)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from user input. It then calculates the number of groups of four identical integers that can be formed from the list `a` and prints this count. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the program prints the count of such groups.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is a good approach to keep track of how many sticks of each length are available.

3. **Calculating the Number of Polygons:**
   - The program iterates over the values in the dictionary `cnt` and for each value `x`, it calculates `x // 4` and adds it to `ans`.
   - The logic `x // 4` is used to determine how many regular polygons (specifically squares) can be formed with the sticks of length `x`. This is because a square requires 4 sticks of the same length.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result `ans` for each test case, which is the total number of squares that can be formed.

### Issues:

1. **Polygon Types:**
   - The program only considers squares (4-sided polygons) and does not account for other types of regular polygons (e.g., triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.). This is a significant oversight because the problem statement does not restrict the polygons to squares only.

2. **Incorrect Calculation:**
   - The program should consider the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed, not just squares. For example, if there are 6 sticks of length 2, it should be able to form 2 triangles (each requiring 3 sticks) or 1 square (requiring 4 sticks), but the current program would only output 1 (for the square).

### Corrected Program:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible regular polygons and choose the one that maximizes the number of polygons formed.

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        for sides in range(3, 101):  # Consider polygons from 3 to 100 sides
            ans += x // sides
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The input handling remains the same as in the original program.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The dictionary `cnt` is used to count the occurrences of each stick length.

3. **Calculating the Number of Polygons:**
   - For each stick length `x` in the dictionary, the program iterates over all possible polygon sides from 3 to 100.
   - For each number of sides `sides`, it calculates `x // sides` to determine how many polygons of that type can be formed and adds it to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result `ans` for each test case, which is the total number of regular polygons that can be formed.

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it only considers squares and not other types of regular polygons. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
