Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 4.
- `cnt` remains unchanged.

Let's break down the `print(ans)` statement step by step:

1. **`ans` Calculation**:
   - `ans` is calculated as the sum of the integer division of each count in the list `cnt` by 4.
   - Integer division by 4 means each element in `cnt` is divided by 4, and the fractional part is discarded (i.e., the result is the floor of the division).

2. **Output**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`.

Since the exact values of `cnt` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `ans` in terms of the elements of `cnt`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 4)**
