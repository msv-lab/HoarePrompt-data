The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` (the number of test cases) is not directly relevant to the loop head, but it indirectly affects the value of `int(input())` because `t` represents the number of test cases.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the loop is iterating over the number of test cases, the value of `int(input())` should be equal to `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0, which is consistent with the range of `t`.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0 (which is equal to `t`)**
