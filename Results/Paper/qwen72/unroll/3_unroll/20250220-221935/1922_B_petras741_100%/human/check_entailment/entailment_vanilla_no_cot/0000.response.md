Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the conditions necessary to form a non-degenerate triangle with sticks of lengths \(2^{a_i}\).

### Issues:
1. **Triangle Inequality Theorem**:
   - For three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
   - In the case of sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if all three sticks have the same length. This is because \(2^a + 2^b \leq 2^c\) if \(a \leq c\) and \(b \leq c\) and \(a \neq b\).

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks from the same length and from different lengths, but it does not correctly enforce the condition that all three sticks must have the same length to form a triangle.
   - Specifically, the program incorrectly adds combinations of sticks with different lengths, which cannot form a triangle.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, count the number of sticks of each unique length.
- For each unique length, if there are at least 3 sticks of that length, calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from those sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{k}{3} \), where \( k \) is the number of sticks of that length.
- Sum these values for all unique lengths to get the total number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
        if n < 3:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        count = [0] * (n + 1)
        for length in w:
            count[length] += 1
        
        result = 0
        for c in count:
            if c >= 3:
                result += c * (c - 1) * (c - 2) // 6
        
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected program will correctly count the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle from the given sticks.
