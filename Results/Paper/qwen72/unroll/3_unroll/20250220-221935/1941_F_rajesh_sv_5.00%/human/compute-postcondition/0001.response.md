The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `testcases`. The loop will execute if `testcases` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `testcases` must be greater than 0.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0**
