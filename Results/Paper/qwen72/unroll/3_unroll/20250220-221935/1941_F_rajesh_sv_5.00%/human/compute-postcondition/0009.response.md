Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, `A` remains a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, `D` remains a sorted list of unique values, `F` remains the value returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference, `left` is the element in `A` at index `index - 1`, `right` is the element in `A` at index `index`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.**
