The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. Here, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` are integers where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. `p` is a permutation of length `n`, and `a` is an array of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints and relationships. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept multiple test cases, each with the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`, and return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. It returns a result for each test case based on these parameters.**
