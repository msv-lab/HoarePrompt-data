### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` and the arrays `p` and `a`.

2. **Adjusting Positions**:
   - The positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing, which is necessary for accessing elements in the arrays `p` and `a`.

3. **Initial Scores**:
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.

4. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program iterates `k` times to simulate the game turns.
   - On each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It calculates the maximum possible score for each player by considering the current score and the remaining turns.

5. **Final Comparison**:
   - After the loop, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater, and "Draw" if both scores are equal.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Score Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the maximum possible score for each player. It should not be using `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp` to determine the maximum score. Instead, it should simply accumulate the scores based on the positions and the array `a`.

2. **Position Update**:
   - The position update logic is correct, but the score calculation logic is flawed.

3. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop should iterate exactly `k` times, but the program incorrectly decrements `k` inside the loop and breaks when `k` reaches 0. This is not necessary and can be simplified.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bodya_score = 0
        sasha_score = 0
        
        for j in range(k):
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the score calculation and unnecessary complexity in the loop.
- The corrected program correctly simulates the game by updating the positions and scores for each turn and then comparing the final scores.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
