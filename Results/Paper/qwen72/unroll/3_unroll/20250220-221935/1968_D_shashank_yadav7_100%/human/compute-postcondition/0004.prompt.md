You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, P_S are integers where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. p is a permutation of length n, and a is an array of length n where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        
        s -= 1
        
        sp = a[s]
        
        bp = a[b]
        
        bm = a[b] * k
        
        sm = a[s] * k
        
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
        
    #State: The loop iterates through `t` test cases, and for each test case, it processes the integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. After the loop, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. The variables `b` and `s` are modified within the loop but are reset for each new test case. The variables `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are used to calculate the scores for each test case and are reset for each new test case. The output state for each test case is either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. It returns a result for each test case based on these parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
