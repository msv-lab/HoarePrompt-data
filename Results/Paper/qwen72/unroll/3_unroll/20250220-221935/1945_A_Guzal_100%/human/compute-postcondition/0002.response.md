Output State: **The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated `n` times based on user input. The variable `k` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and then calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop. The final state of `a`, `b`, and `c` after the loop will be the values from the last iteration of user input. The value of `k` will be the result of the last calculation performed in the loop.**
