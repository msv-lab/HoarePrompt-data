The function `func` is expected to take no input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be modified to take an integer `t` and a list of strings `s_list` where `t` represents the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and each string `s` in `s_list` consists of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s_list` does not exceed 10^6.
