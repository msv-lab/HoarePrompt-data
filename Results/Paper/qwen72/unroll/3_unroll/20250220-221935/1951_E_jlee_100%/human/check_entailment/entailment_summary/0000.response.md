### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Single Character String:**
   - The function first checks if the length of the string `s` is 1. If it is, the function prints 'NO' because a single character string is always a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

2. **Check if the First and Last Characters are Different:**
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different (`s[0] != s[-1]`), the function prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring. This is correct because a string with different first and last characters cannot be a palindrome.

3. **Check for All Characters Being the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(s[0]) == n`), the function prints 'NO' because any substring of a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.

4. **Check for One Different Character:**
   - If all but one character in the string are the same (`s.count(s[0]) == n - 1`), the function checks if the string length is odd and the middle character is different from the rest. If so, it prints 'NO' because the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring. This is correct because a string with one different character and an even length can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

5. **General Case:**
   - For strings that do not fall into the above categories, the function iterates through the string to find the first and second occurrences of a character different from the first character (`s[0]`).
   - If it finds such a character, it prints 'YES' and splits the string into two parts at the position of the second different character. This ensures that both parts are non-palindromic.
   - If it does not find such a character, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the edge cases of single character strings and strings with all characters being the same.
- It also correctly handles strings with one different character and ensures that the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings if possible.
- For the general case, the function ensures that the string is split into two non-palindromic substrings if possible, which is a valid solution.

However, there is a potential issue in the general case logic. The function might not always find the correct split points, especially if the string has more than one different character. For example, the string "abab" should be split into "a" and "bab" or "ab" and "ab", but the function might not handle this correctly.

### Correctness: **False**

The function does not always correctly partition the string into non-palindromic substrings, especially in more complex cases where there are multiple different characters. A more robust solution would be needed to handle all cases correctly.
