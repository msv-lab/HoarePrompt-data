### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the length of the string `n` is 1, it prints "NO" and continues to the next test case. This is correct because a single-character string is always a palindrome.
   - It checks if the first and last characters of the string are different. If they are, the string is not a palindrome, and it prints "YES" followed by the string itself as a single part. This is correct because a string that starts and ends with different characters cannot be a palindrome.

3. **Character Frequency Checks**:
   - If all characters in the string are the same, it prints "NO". This is correct because a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.
   - If all but one character are the same, it checks if the string length is odd and the middle character is different from the rest. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the string itself as a single part. This is correct because a string with all but one character the same and an odd length with a different middle character cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic parts.

4. **General Case**:
   - The program iterates through the string to find the first and second positions where the characters differ from the first character.
   - If it finds such positions, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts (2) and the two parts of the string. This is correct because it ensures that the parts are not palindromic.
   - If it does not find such positions, it prints "NO". This is correct because it means the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic parts.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the edge cases and general cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that for each test case, it either prints "NO" if the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic parts or prints "YES" followed by a valid partition.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
