Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n = 1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `n = 1`, the program should print "NO" because it is impossible to construct a string with exactly one special character. However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" for `n = 1` and does not handle this case as specified. Additionally, the program uses `os.system('cls')` to clear the console, which is not necessary for the problem and could cause issues on systems that do not support this command (e.g., Unix-based systems).
