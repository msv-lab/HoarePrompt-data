Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

# Annotated Program:
import os
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string. The function should be able to process a number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50), where each test case is provided as an input to the function.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The console screen is cleared. `s` is assigned the value 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. `t` is an input integer. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, if `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed followed by a string `ans` that contains `n` special characters. The string `ans` is constructed by repeating each character from `s` twice, starting from the first character, until the required length `n` is reached. If `n` is odd, the string `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then continues with the pattern.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It clears the console screen and then processes a series of test cases. The number of test cases, `t`, is taken as input from the user, and for each test case, another input `n` is taken, representing the number of special characters required in a string. If `n` is 1, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans` that contains exactly `n` characters. For even `n`, `ans` is constructed by repeating each character from the uppercase alphabet twice, starting from 'A'. For odd `n`, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then continues with the same repeating pattern until the length `n` is reached. The function does not return any value.
