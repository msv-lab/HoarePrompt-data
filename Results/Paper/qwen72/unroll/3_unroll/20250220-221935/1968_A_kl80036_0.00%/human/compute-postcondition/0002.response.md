The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally handle or process a set of test cases, each with an integer `x` such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns. 

Functionality: **The function processes a set of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and each test case involves an integer `x` between 2 and 1000. The specific output or return value of the function is not provided.**
