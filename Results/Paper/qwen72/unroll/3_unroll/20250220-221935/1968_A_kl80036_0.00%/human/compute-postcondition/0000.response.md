The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function and does not need to be explicitly adjusted. However, the input must be a valid integer within the specified range for the loop to potentially execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
