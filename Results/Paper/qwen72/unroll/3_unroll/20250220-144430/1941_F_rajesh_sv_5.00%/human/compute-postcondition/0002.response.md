Output State: **`testcases` is the result of `func_3()`, and no other variables are affected.** 

The loop iterates `testcases` times, and each iteration calls `func_6()`. Since the loop does not modify the value of `testcases` or any other variables, the state of `testcases` remains the same as it was after `func_3()` was called. Any other variables that were not affected by the initial state or the loop body remain unchanged.
