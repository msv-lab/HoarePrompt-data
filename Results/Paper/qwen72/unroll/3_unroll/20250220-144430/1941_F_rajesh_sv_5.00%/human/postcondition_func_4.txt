The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `delimiter` (defaulting to a single space ' ') and returns a list of integers. This list is obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_2()` using the specified `delimiter` and converting each resulting substring into an integer. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the returned list of integers, and the `delimiter` parameter remains unchanged.
