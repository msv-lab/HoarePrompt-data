Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the maximum difference (`max_diff`) is not reduced by adding any new problem. In such a case, the `ans` variable should be updated to the minimum of `ans` and `next_max_diff`, but the program only prints the maximum of `ans` and `next_max_diff`. This can lead to incorrect results when the addition of any new problem does not reduce the maximum difference, and the second largest difference (`next_max_diff`) is actually the minimum imbalance that can be achieved.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 5 5
5 10 15 20 26
11 14 16 13 8
16 4 5 3 1
```
The maximum difference in the original set is 6 (26 - 20). The program should check if adding any new problem can reduce this difference. However, if no new problem can reduce the maximum difference, the program should output the second largest difference, which is 5 (15 - 10). The current program will output 6, which is incorrect.
