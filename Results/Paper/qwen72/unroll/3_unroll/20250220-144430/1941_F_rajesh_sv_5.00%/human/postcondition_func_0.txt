The function `func_1` accepts a callable function `func` and returns a function named `wrapper`. The function `func_1` does not modify or use the provided `func` in any way within its body. After the function concludes, the returned `wrapper` function can be used independently, but it does not have any specific behavior or functionality defined within `func_1`.
