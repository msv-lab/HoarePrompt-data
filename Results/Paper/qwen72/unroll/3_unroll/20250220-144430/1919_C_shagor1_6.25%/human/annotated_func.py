#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem but lacks parameters and a clear definition. For the problem described, the function should be defined with parameters `t` and `a`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `a` is a list of lists, each inner list representing an array of integers of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) with elements a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        *inp, = map(int, input().split())
        
        x = y = n + 1
        
        ans = 0
        
        for a in inp:
            if a <= x:
                x = a
            elif a <= y:
                y = a
            else:
                x == y
                y = a
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the size of the array `n`, and the elements of the array. It then processes the array to find two minimum values `x` and `y` and counts the number of elements that are greater than both `x` and `y`. The final output is the count of such elements for each test case. The variables `x` and `y` are reset to `n + 1` for each new test case, and `ans` is reset to 0. After all iterations, the function prints the value of `ans` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the size of an array, followed by `n` integers. It then processes the array to find two minimum values and counts the number of elements that are greater than both of these minimum values. The function prints the count for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
