### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is acceptable since it reads input from `stdin`.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variables `x` and `y` are initialized to `n + 1`, which is a valid approach to ensure they are greater than any possible element in the array `a` (since elements are between 1 and `n`).
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 for each test case, which is correct.

3. **Processing the Array:**
   - The function iterates through the elements of the array `inp` (which is a list of integers read from input).
   - It updates `x` and `y` to be the two smallest elements encountered so far.
   - If an element `a` is greater than both `x` and `y`, it increments `ans` by 1. This is intended to count the number of elements that are greater than both of the two smallest elements, which is a reasonable approach to minimize the penalty.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is the correct output format.

5. **Logical Flaw:**
   - The line `x == y` is a comparison and does not perform any assignment or update. This line is redundant and should be removed.
   - The logic for updating `x` and `y` and counting the elements greater than both is correct, but the comparison `x == y` is unnecessary and can lead to confusion.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The function contains a logical flaw where `x == y` is a comparison and not an assignment. This line should be removed to ensure the function works as intended.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        *inp, = map(int, input().split())
        
        x = y = n + 1
        
        ans = 0
        
        for a in inp:
            if a <= x:
                x = a
            elif a <= y:
                y = a
            else:
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
- The line `x == y` has been removed. This ensures that the function correctly updates `x` and `y` to be the two smallest elements and counts the elements greater than both, which is the intended behavior to minimize the penalty.
