The function `func` should accept two parameters: `t` and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `a` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents an array of integers of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and each element a_i in these arrays satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases in `a`. Each result indicates some computed value or status based on the input array for that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases and each inner list in `a` is an array of integers. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to one of the test cases.**
