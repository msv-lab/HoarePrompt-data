Precondition: **The function `func` is intended to solve a problem but lacks parameters and a clear definition. For the problem described, the function should be defined with parameters `t` and `a`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `a` is a list of lists, each inner list representing an array of integers of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) with elements a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
