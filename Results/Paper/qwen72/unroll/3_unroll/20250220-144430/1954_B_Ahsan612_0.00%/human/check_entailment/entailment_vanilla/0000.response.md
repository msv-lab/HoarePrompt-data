### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `ar`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `same` is initialized to 1, which will be used to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - The variable `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar[0]`.
   - The variable `minn` is initialized to infinity (`inf`), which will be used to track the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same.

3. **Loop Through the Array**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through the array.
   - For each element, it checks if the current element `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.
   - If they are equal, it increments the `same` counter.
   - If they are not equal, it moves to the next element, updates `num` to the next element, and updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - The `same` counter is reset to 1 for the new sequence of consecutive elements.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the program updates `minn` one last time to ensure the last sequence of consecutive elements is considered.
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means all elements in the array are the same, and it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. Therefore, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same.

5. **Logic for Non-Beautiful Array**:
   - The program aims to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same. This is because removing elements from a sequence of consecutive elements can potentially break the "beautiful" property.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful or where the array length is 1 or 2. For example, in the case of an array with length 1 or 2, the program should output `-1` because it is impossible to make a non-beautiful array from such a small array.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the array length is 1 or 2 correctly. For these cases, the array is already non-beautiful, and the program should output `-1`.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect because it does not handle the edge cases where the array length is 1 or 2. For these cases, the array is already non-beautiful, and the program should output `-1`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
