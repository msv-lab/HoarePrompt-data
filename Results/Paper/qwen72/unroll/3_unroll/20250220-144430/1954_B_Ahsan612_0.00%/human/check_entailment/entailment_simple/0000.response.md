### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it is no longer beautiful.
   - An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself \( ar \).
   - It initializes `same` to 1, which will count the length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - It initializes `num` to the first element of the array, and `minn` to infinity (`inf`), which will store the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - It iterates through the array, updating `same` when it encounters the same number, and updating `minn` when it encounters a different number.
   - After the loop, it prints `-1` if `minn` is still infinity, indicating that the array consists of a single unique number repeated. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - However, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The minimum length of consecutive segments does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the minimum length of consecutive segments is 1, but removing one element (e.g., the last `1`) is sufficient to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The program should instead check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. This involves checking if there are any segments of the same number that can be broken by removing one or more elements.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To make the array non-beautiful, we need to ensure that no segment of the same number can be made uniform by the given operation.
   - If the array consists of a single unique number repeated, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful, and we should print `-1`.
   - If the array has at least one segment of the same number that is not the entire array, we can remove elements to break that segment. The minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the smallest segment minus 1.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only finds the minimum length of consecutive segments, which is not the same as the minimum number of elements to remove.
