Output State: **For each test case, the loop will print the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number in the array `ar`. If the array `ar` consists of a single unique number repeated, it will print `-1`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will remain unchanged as they are input variables. The loop variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` will be reset for each test case, and their final values after the loop will not be meaningful outside the context of the loop.**
