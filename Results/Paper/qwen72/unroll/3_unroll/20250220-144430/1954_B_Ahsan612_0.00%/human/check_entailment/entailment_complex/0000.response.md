### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it is no longer "beautiful."
   - An array is "beautiful" if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element at index `i` with `a_{i-1}` when `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.
   - If it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to 1, which will count the length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - It initializes `num` to the first element of the array and `minn` to infinity, which will store the minimum length of consecutive segments.
   - The program then iterates through the array:
     - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
     - If the current element is different, it updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time.
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means the array consists of a single unique number repeated, and it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful.
   - The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The logic for updating `minn` and `same` is flawed. It only considers the length of consecutive segments of the same number, but it does not consider the conditions required to make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To make the array non-beautiful, we need to break the condition `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}` for all `i` where `2 <= i <= n-1`.
   - If the array has a segment of length 3 or more where all elements are the same, removing one element from this segment will make the array non-beautiful.
   - If the array has a segment of length 2, removing one element will also make the array non-beautiful.
   - If the array consists of a single unique number repeated, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful, and we should output `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It only calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number, which is not the same as determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

**Correctness: False**
