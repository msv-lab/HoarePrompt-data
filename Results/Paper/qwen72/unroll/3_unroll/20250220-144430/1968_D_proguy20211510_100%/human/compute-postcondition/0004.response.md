Output State: **The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `MOD`, and `alpha` remain unchanged. The variables `pathb`, `paths`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres` are reset and recalculated for each test case. After all iterations of the loop, the final values of `pathb`, `paths`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres` are undefined as they are reinitialized and used within each test case loop. The loop prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' for each test case based on the calculated values of `resb` and `ress`.**
