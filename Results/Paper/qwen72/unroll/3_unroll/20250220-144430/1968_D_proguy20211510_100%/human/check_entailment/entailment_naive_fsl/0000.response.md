Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are the same. According to the game rules, if both players start at the same position, they will follow the same path and have the same score, resulting in a draw. However, the program does not account for this scenario and may incorrectly determine a winner.

Example of incorrect behavior:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2 2 2
  1 2 3 4
  5 10 15 20
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  Draw
  ```
- Actual Output:
  The program will likely output either "Bodya" or "Sasha" instead of "Draw" because it does not check if the starting positions are the same and handle it accordingly.
