### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
   - It converts the input strings to integers and initializes the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program uses a while loop to detect cycles for both Bodya and Sasha starting from their respective positions.
   - It appends the scores at each position to the `pathb` and `paths` lists.
   - It marks visited positions using the `vis` list to avoid infinite loops.
   - The cycle detection logic is correct and ensures that the program does not get stuck in an infinite loop.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for each player by iterating through their respective paths.
   - It uses a prefix sum approach to keep track of the cumulative score and multiplies the current score by the remaining number of turns `(k - i)` to account for the possibility of staying at the same position.
   - The logic for calculating the score is correct, but it could be optimized to avoid recalculating the same sums multiple times. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both players, the program compares them and prints the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".
   - The comparison and output logic are correct and handle all possible outcomes.

### Potential Issues:
- **Cycle Length Handling:**
  - The program does break the loop if `k < i + 1`, which is a correct approach to handle the case where the cycle length is greater than `k`. This ensures that the program does not perform unnecessary calculations.

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sum calculation is correct, but it could be optimized to avoid recalculating the same sums multiple times. However, this is a performance issue and does not affect the correctness of the program.

- **Variable Naming:**
  - The variable names `YES` and `NO` are defined but never used, which is unnecessary and can be removed. This does not affect the correctness of the program.

- **Unrelated Variables:**
  - The variable `alpha` is defined but not used in the program, which is unnecessary and can be removed. This does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for the permutation game as described in the problem statement. It handles the input, cycle detection, score calculation, and comparison correctly. The only issues are some unnecessary variables and potential optimization, but these do not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
