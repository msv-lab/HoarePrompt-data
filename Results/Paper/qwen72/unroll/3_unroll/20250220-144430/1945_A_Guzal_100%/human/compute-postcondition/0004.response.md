Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. The function calculates a value `k` based on these inputs and prints it. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `k`, which is the sum of `a` and the integer division of `(b + c)` by 3, plus 1 if `(b + c) % 3` is not zero. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained between iterations. The function does not return any value; it only prints the calculated values for each test case. **
