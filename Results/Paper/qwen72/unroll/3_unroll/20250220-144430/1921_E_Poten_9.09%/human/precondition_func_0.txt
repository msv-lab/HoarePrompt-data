The function `func` is intended to solve the game outcome problem but lacks parameters in its definition. The correct function definition should include parameters for the board dimensions and initial chip positions, such as `def func(t, h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b):`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of the board, and `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively. Additionally, `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9`, and it is guaranteed that either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`.
