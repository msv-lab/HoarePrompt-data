Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is intended to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each iteration, the function expects two integers `x` and `y` to be provided as input, with both `x` and `y` ranging from 0 to 9. The function returns a value based on the input `x` and `y` for each iteration, but the specific return value is not described.**
