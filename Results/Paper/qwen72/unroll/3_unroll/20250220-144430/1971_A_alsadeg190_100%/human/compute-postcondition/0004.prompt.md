You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates t times, where t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each iteration, x and y are integers provided as input, with 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: The loop will execute x times, and for each iteration, it will take two integers x and y as input. If x is less than y, it will print x followed by y. Otherwise, it will print y followed by x. The values of x and y will be updated with each iteration, and the final values of x and y will be the ones provided in the last input. The loop variable i will be equal to x-1 after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is intended to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each iteration, the function expects two integers `x` and `y` to be provided as input, with both `x` and `y` ranging from 0 to 9. The function returns a value based on the input `x` and `y` for each iteration, but the specific return value is not described.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
