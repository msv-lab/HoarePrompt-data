The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is intended to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each iteration, the function reads an integer `x` from the user, and then for each value from 0 to `x-1`, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the final values of `x` and `y` will be the ones provided in the last input, and the loop variable `i` will be equal to `x-1`.
