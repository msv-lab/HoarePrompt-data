Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in how the `func_1` function constructs the mapping between characters in the encoded string and their corresponding characters in the original string.

### Explanation:
1. **Mapping Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to create a mapping from each character in the encoded string to a character in the original string. However, it does so by iterating over all lowercase letters and assigning the first available letter that is not already in the values of the mapping.
   - This approach does not follow the symmetric replacement rule described in the problem. Instead, it assigns the first available letter, which is incorrect.

2. **Symmetric Replacement**:
   - According to the problem, the first character in the string `r` (which consists of all distinct letters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order) should be replaced by the last character in `r`, the second character by the second last, and so on.
   - The correct approach would be to first construct the string `r` from the encoded string `b`, and then use this string to perform the symmetric replacement.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Construct the string r from the encoded string
    r = sorted(set(encoded))
    
    # Step 2: Create the mapping for symmetric replacement
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Step 3: Decode the string using the mapping
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    
    return ''.join(decoded)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Implementation:
1. **Constructing `r`**:
   - `r` is constructed by taking the set of distinct characters in the encoded string and sorting them alphabetically.
   
2. **Creating the Mapping**:
   - A dictionary `mapping` is created where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`. For example, if `r` is "cdefors", then 'c' maps to 's', 'd' maps to 'r', and so on.
   
3. **Decoding the String**:
   - The encoded string is decoded by replacing each character with its corresponding character from the `mapping`.

This corrected implementation will correctly decode the string as required by the problem statement.
