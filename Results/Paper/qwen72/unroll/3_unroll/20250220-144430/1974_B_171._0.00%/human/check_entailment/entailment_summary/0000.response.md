Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. Instead of creating a mapping based on the distinct characters of the original string `s` and their symmetric positions in the alphabetically ordered string `r`, the function dynamically assigns a unique character from 'a' to 'z' to each character in the encoded string `encoded`. This approach does not follow the symmetric replacement rule and will not produce the correct original string.

For example, for the encoded string "serofedsoc", the function will create a mapping like:
- 's' -> 'a'
- 'e' -> 'b'
- 'r' -> 'c'
- 'o' -> 'd'
- 'f' -> 'e'
- 'd' -> 'f'
- 'e' -> 'g'
- 's' -> 'h'
- 'o' -> 'i'
- 'c' -> 'j'

This results in the decoded string "abcdefghij", which is clearly incorrect. The correct decoding should reverse the symmetric replacement process used in the encoding.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Constructing the string `r` from the distinct characters of the encoded string `encoded` in alphabetical order.
2. Creating a mapping where the first character of `r` maps to the last character of `r`, the second character of `r` maps to the second last character of `r`, and so on.
3. Using this mapping to decode the string `encoded`.

Given the incorrect implementation, the program does not produce the expected output.

Correctness: **False**
