Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. The issue lies in the logic used to create the `mapping` dictionary. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string by reversing the encoding process, but it incorrectly maps characters in the encoded string to their corresponding characters in the auxiliary string `r` in a way that does not follow the symmetric replacement rule.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
10
serofedsoc
```
The expected output is "codeforces". However, the program will output a different string because it incorrectly maps characters in the encoded string to characters in the auxiliary string `r` without considering the symmetric replacement rule.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Constructing the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.
2. Creating a symmetric mapping based on `r`.
3. Using this mapping to decode the encoded string.

The current implementation does not handle these steps correctly, leading to incorrect decoding.
