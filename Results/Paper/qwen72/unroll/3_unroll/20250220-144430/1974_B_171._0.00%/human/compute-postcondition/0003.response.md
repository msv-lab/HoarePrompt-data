Output State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, and `decoded` is a list of lowercase Latin letters where each letter corresponds to the mapped value of the character in `encoded` based on `mapping`. The `decoded` list will contain the same number of elements as the length of `encoded`.

To break it down further:
- `encoded`: Remains unchanged.
- `mapping`: Contains a mapping from each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter.
- `decoded`: Contains the characters from `encoded` translated using the `mapping` dictionary.

For example, if `encoded` was "abc", and the loop executed, the `decoded` list might be "abc" if the characters in `encoded` were already mapped to themselves, or it could be "def" if the characters in `encoded` were mapped to "d", "e", and "f" respectively, depending on the order of characters in `encoded` and the available letters in the range 'a' to 'z'.
