### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common and efficient approach for handling large inputs.
   - It correctly iterates over the test cases, parsing the length `n` and the array `arr` for each test case and storing them in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Median Calculation:**
   - The median index is calculated as `median_index = n // 2`. This is correct for finding the median in a sorted array. For an odd-length array, it correctly points to the middle element. For an even-length array, it points to the left middle element, which is the correct position for the median as per the problem description.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A heap is created from the elements starting from the median index to the end of the array using `heap = arr[median_index:]` and `heapq.heapify(heap)`.
   - This is a valid approach because the heap will contain the elements that are candidates for being the new median after the operations.

4. **Incrementing Elements:**
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
   - Each increment operation is counted and added to `operations`.
   - The logic ensures that the smallest element in the heap is incremented, which is the correct approach to minimize the number of operations.

5. **Output:**
   - The number of operations required to increase the median is appended to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the results are printed one by one.

### Analysis of Function Summary:
- The function summary states that `func_1` returns a list of integers representing the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the sorted list `a` greater than the median of that list.
- This is slightly misleading because the function actually increments elements to make the median of the array increase, not just the smallest element in the sorted list.
- However, the core logic of the function is correct: it increments the smallest elements that are greater than or equal to the current median until the median is increased.

### Edge Cases:
- **Array of length 1:**
  - For an array of length 1, the median is the only element. The program correctly handles this by not entering the while loop and returning 1 as the number of operations needed to increase the median.
- **Array with all elements the same:**
  - If all elements are the same, the program will increment the median element until it is greater than the current median, which is the correct behavior.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The use of a heap ensures that the operations are performed efficiently, and the program handles various edge cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
