### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a potential issue with the handling of even-length arrays. However, let's break down the function `func_1` and the problem description to see if this issue actually affects the correctness of the program.

1. **Problem Description and Median Calculation:**
   - For an odd-length array, the median is the element at index \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil - 1\) (0-indexed).
   - For an even-length array, the median is the element at index \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil - 1\) (0-indexed), which is the same as `n // 2` in Python (since Python uses floor division for integers).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function sorts the array `arr` and then determines the median index as `median_index = n // 2`.
   - It then creates a heap starting from the median index and all elements to the right of it.
   - The function increments the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.

3. **Handling Even-Length Arrays:**
   - The function correctly identifies the median index as `n // 2` for both odd and even lengths.
   - For an even-length array, the median is the element at index `n // 2` (0-indexed), which is the second middle element.
   - The function uses a heap to increment elements starting from the median index, ensuring that the smallest element in the heap (which includes the median and all elements to the right) is increased until it is greater than the current median.

4. **Potential Issue:**
   - The original assessment suggests that the program should consider both middle elements for even-length arrays. However, the problem description only requires increasing the median, which is the element at index `n // 2` for even-length arrays.
   - The function correctly identifies and increments the element at index `n // 2` and all elements to the right, which is sufficient to increase the median.

5. **Example Re-evaluation:**
   - Consider the test case `n = 4`, `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - The median is the element at index `2` (0-indexed), which is `3`.
     - The function will start with the heap `[3, 4]` and increment the smallest element until it is greater than `3`.
     - The first increment will make the heap `[4, 4]`, and the operations count will be `1`.
     - The median is now `4`, which is greater than the original median `3`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles both odd and even-length arrays by focusing on the element at index `n // 2` and ensuring it is increased to be greater than the current median.
   - The original assessment's concern about handling both middle elements for even-length arrays is not necessary because the problem only requires increasing the median, which is the element at index `n // 2`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The original assessment was inaccurate in this context.
