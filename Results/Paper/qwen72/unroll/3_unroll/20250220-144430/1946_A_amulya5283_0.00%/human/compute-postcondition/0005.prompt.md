You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and test_cases is a list of t test cases, where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with n being an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and a being a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, arr = test_cases[i]
        
        arr.sort()
        
        median_index = n // 2
        
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        
        operations = 0
        
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, test_cases is a list of t test cases, where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with n being an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and a being a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. results is a list of t integers, where each integer represents the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the sorted list of the corresponding test case greater than the median of that list.
    return results
    #The program returns a list 'results' containing t integers, where each integer represents the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the sorted list of the corresponding test case greater than the median of that list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list `test_cases` of `t` tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the sorted list `a` greater than the median of that list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list 'results' containing t integers, where each integer represents the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the sorted list of the corresponding test case greater than the median of that list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
