The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in its definition, but based on the parameter constraints provided, it seems to handle multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The constraints indicate that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\). For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9\).

Since the function definition does not include parameters, it is likely that the function is designed to read these values from an external source (e.g., user input, file, or another function) and process each test case accordingly.

The output of the function is not explicitly described, but typically in such scenarios, the function would return or print the result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where \(1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9\)), and returns or prints a result for each test case. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).**
