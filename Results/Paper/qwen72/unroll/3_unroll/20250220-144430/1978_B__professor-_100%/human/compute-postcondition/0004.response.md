Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. Depending on the relationship between `a` and `b`, it calculates and prints one of three possible results: `n * a` if `b <= a`, `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)` if `b - a >= n`, or `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)` otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged. **
