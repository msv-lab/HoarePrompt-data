### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

2. **Analyzing the Conditions:**
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any advantage.
     - The profit is simply `n * a`.
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob can sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `(b - n + 1)`, which is given by the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first `(b - a + 1)` buns at the modified price and the remaining `(n - (b - a + 1))` buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The profit from the first `(b - a + 1)` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `a`, which is given by the formula `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2)`.
     - The profit from the remaining `(n - (b - a + 1))` buns is `a * (n - (b - a + 1))`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts: `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.

3. **Evaluating the Program:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` and applies the correct logic based on the conditions:
     - If `b <= a`, it prints `n * a`.
     - If `b - a >= n`, it prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.

4. **Checking the Formulas:**
   - The formula `n * a` is correct for the case where `b <= a`.
   - The formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)` is correct for the case where `b - a >= n`, as it calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
   - The formula `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)` is correct for the case where `b - a < n`, as it calculates the sum of the first `(b - a + 1)` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, and then adds the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price `a`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n`, `a`, and `b` are at their maximum values (`10^9`), and when `n` is 1.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `b` is exactly equal to `a`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description and constraints accurately.

Correctness: **True**
