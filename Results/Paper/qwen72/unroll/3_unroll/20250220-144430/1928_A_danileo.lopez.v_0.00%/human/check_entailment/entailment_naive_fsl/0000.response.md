Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both dimensions of the rectangle are odd but the rectangle can still be cut into two smaller rectangles to form a different rectangle. For example, consider the rectangle with dimensions 3 \times 3. This rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times 1 rectangles, and these two rectangles can be used to form a 1 \times 6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3 \times 3 rectangle. However, the program will output "No" for this case because both `a` and `b` are odd, which is incorrect according to the problem description.
