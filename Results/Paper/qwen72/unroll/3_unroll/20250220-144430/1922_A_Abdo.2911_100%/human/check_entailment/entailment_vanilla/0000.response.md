### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It then reads the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.

2. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `possible` to `False`. This variable will be used to determine if a valid template exists.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - **Case 1:** If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`:
       - This means both `a` and `b` must match the same character at position `i` in the template.
       - If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (and thus `b[i]`), then `c` does not match the template at this position, and we can set `possible` to `True` and break out of the loop.
     - **Case 2:** If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`:
       - This means `a` and `b` must match different characters at position `i` in the template.
       - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `c` matches the template at this position, and we continue to the next position.
       - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `c` does not match the template at this position, and we can set `possible` to `True` and break out of the loop.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, it prints "YES" because a valid template exists.
   - If `possible` is `False`, it prints "NO" because no valid template exists.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly handles the conditions for a valid template:
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, `c[i]` must be different.
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, `c[i]` must be different from both.
- The function breaks out of the loop as soon as it finds a valid position, which is efficient.
- The function correctly prints "YES" or "NO" based on the value of `possible`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
