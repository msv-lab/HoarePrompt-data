The function `func_1` should accept two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function is expected to process each test case and return a result based on the provided parameters. However, the given function definition `def func_1():` does not match the expected parameters.

Functionality: **The function should accept an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the provided parameters.**
