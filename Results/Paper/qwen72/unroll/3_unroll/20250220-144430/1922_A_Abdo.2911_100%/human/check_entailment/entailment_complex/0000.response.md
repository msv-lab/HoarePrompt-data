Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `possible` to `False`.
   - It iterates over each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1` and checks the following conditions:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (and thus `b[i]`) for the template to be valid.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the template to be valid.
   - If any of these conditions are met, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `possible` is `False`, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `a` and `b` are identical and `c` differs at some position.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `a` and `b` differ at some positions and `c` must differ from both `a` and `b` at those positions.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The function's logic aligns with the problem description. It checks if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not.

6. **Input and Output**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and prints the output as required by the problem description.

However, there is a minor issue in the logic:
- The condition `if a[i] == b[i]:` should ensure that `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (and thus `b[i]`).
- The condition `elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:` should ensure that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different and `c[i]` is the same as one of them, which means the template cannot be formed at that position.

Given the above reasoning, the function is mostly correct, but the logic for the `elif` condition is not entirely clear. The `elif` condition should be more explicitly checked to ensure that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different and `c[i]` is the same as one of them.

Correctness: **False**

The function needs a slight adjustment to correctly handle the `elif` condition. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] == a[i]:
                    possible = False
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                possible = False
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the template conditions are properly checked.
