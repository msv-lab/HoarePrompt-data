The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then checks if it is possible to transform string `a` into string `b` by changing any character in `a` to the corresponding character in `c`. If such a transformation is possible for any test case, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are no longer in scope.
