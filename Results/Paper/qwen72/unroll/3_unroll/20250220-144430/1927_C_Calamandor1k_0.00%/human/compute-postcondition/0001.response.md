The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop is iterating over `t`, and `t` is already given to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted as it is not used in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration**
