The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. The function then checks if at least `k // 2` elements in both `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k`. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program includes the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` from the last test case, and the variables `len_a`, `len_b`, `count_a`, and `count_b` are updated based on the last test case.
