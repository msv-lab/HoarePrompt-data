### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The maximum sum is achieved when each element in the matrix is the largest possible value, which is \( n \).
   - Therefore, the maximum sum is \( n \times n \times n = n^3 \).

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The correct maximum sum is \( n^3 \), as each element in the matrix can be \( n \).

3. **Operations to Achieve Maximum Sum**:
   - To achieve the maximum sum, we can perform \( n \) Type 1 operations, each filling a row with the permutation \( [n, n, \ldots, n] \).
   - Alternatively, we can perform \( n \) Type 2 operations, each filling a column with the permutation \( [n, n, \ldots, n] \).
   - Both approaches will result in a matrix where every element is \( n \), and the sum will be \( n^3 \).

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to \( n \) and calculates the sum based on a condition that is not directly related to the problem's goal of maximizing the sum.
   - The program prints the sum and the number of operations \( n + r \).
   - It then prints the operations, which are not correctly structured to achieve the maximum sum.

5. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The sum calculation logic is incorrect. It should be \( n^3 \) for the maximum sum, but the program calculates a different value.
   - The number of operations \( n + r \) is not necessarily the correct number of operations to achieve the maximum sum. The variable \( r \) is used in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The operations printed are not structured to fill the matrix with the maximum possible values. The program prints permutations of \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which does not maximize the sum.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not provide the correct sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. The logic for sum calculation and the number of operations is flawed, and the operations printed do not follow the correct format to maximize the sum of the matrix.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
