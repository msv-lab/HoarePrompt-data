### Reasoning

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not maximize the sum of the matrix for all cases. Let's break down the issues and validate the assessment step-by-step:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the following logic:
     ```python
     for i in range(1, n + 1):
         if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
             r = i
             sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
         else:
             sum += i * n
     ```
   - This logic is flawed. The sum of all elements in the matrix should be maximized by filling the matrix with the maximum possible values, which are the integers from 1 to n in each row and column. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( n \times \left( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \right) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{n^2 \times (n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program calculates the number of operations as `n + r`, where `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - This calculation is also incorrect. The problem states that the maximum possible sum can always be obtained in no more than \( 2n \) operations. The correct number of operations should be \( 2n \) or less, and the program should ensure that the matrix is filled optimally within this limit.

3. **Output for \( n = 3 \)**:
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     10 4
     1 1 1 2 3
     1 2 1 2 3
     1 3 1 2 3
     2 1 1 2 3
     ```
   - The correct output should be:
     ```
     9 3
     1 1 1 2 3
     1 2 1 2 3
     1 3 1 2 3
     ```
   - The program's output of 10 is incorrect because the maximum sum for a 3x3 matrix is 9, not 10. The program also outputs 4 operations, which is more than necessary.

4. **General Case**:
   - For any \( n \), the correct maximum sum is \( \frac{n^2 \times (n + 1)}{2} \).
   - The correct number of operations is \( n \) (one operation per row) or \( 2n \) (one operation per row and one operation per column).

### Final Evaluation

Given the issues identified in the sum calculation and the number of operations, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for all cases and does not adhere to the constraints on the number of operations.

Final: **False**
