Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the loop will read an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) from the user. After the loop finishes, the variables `sum` and `r` will be calculated and printed for each test case. The variable `sum` will be the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. The variable `r` will be the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition. Additionally, for each test case, the loop will print a series of lines where the first line is `sum` and `n + r`, followed by `n + r` lines. The first `n` lines will print `1` followed by the line number and the range from 1 to `n`. The remaining lines will print `2` followed by the line number modulo `n` and the range from 1 to `n`.**
