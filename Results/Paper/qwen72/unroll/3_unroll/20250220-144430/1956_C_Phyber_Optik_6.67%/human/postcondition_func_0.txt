The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) from the user, representing the size of a matrix. The function calculates and prints two values: `sum` and `n + r`. The variable `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each integer `i` from 1 to `n`, depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. The variable `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies this condition. After printing `sum` and `n + r`, the function prints `n + r` lines. The first `n` lines each start with `1` followed by the line number and the range from 1 to `n`. The remaining lines each start with `2` followed by the line number modulo `n` and the range from 1 to `n`. The function repeats this process for each of the `t` test cases.
