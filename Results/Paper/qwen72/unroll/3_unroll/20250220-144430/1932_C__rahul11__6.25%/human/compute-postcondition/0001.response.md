The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. This means the input provided to the program must be a positive integer, indicating the number of test cases.

State: **`int(input())` must return a positive integer, `_` is 0**
