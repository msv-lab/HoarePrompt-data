You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
        res[0] = ans % m % MOD
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), a positive integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it computes a list `res` of length `n` where the first element is the product of all integers in `a` modulo `m` and then further modulo `10^9 + 6`. Subsequent elements in `res` are computed by iteratively dividing the current product by elements in `a` based on the direction specified by the characters in `s` ('L' for left, 'R' for right), and then applying the same modulo operations. The function prints the `res` list for each test case. After processing all test cases, the `res` list for the last test case is printed, and the variables `ans`, `c`, `l`, and `r` are in their final states, with `ans` being 1 (or 0 if any division by zero occurred), `c` equal to `n`, `l` equal to `n` if all characters in `s` were 'R' or some value between 0 and `n-1` otherwise, and `r` equal to -1 if all characters in `s` were 'L' or some value between 0 and `n-1` otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a few issues that make it incorrect for some potential cases:

1. **Incorrect MOD Value**: The program uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6`, but the problem description does not specify any need for this MOD value. The correct MOD value should be `m` as specified in the input.

2. **Division in Modulo Arithmetic**: The program uses integer division (`ans // arr[l]` and `ans // arr[r]`) to update the product. However, division in modulo arithmetic is not straightforward and can lead to incorrect results. Instead, the program should use the modular multiplicative inverse to correctly handle the division.

3. **Potential Zero Division Error**: If the array contains a zero, the program will attempt to divide by zero, which will raise an error.

4. **Incorrect Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product calculation should be done modulo `m` to avoid overflow issues, but the program does not do this.

Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

Expected Output:
```
0 2 4 1
```

Actual Output:
```
0 2 4 4
```

The actual output is incorrect because the division in modulo arithmetic is not handled correctly, leading to the wrong result for the last command.
