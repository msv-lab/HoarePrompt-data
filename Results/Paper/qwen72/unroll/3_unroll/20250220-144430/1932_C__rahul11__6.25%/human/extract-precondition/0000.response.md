Precondition: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
