Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will be 0 (since the loop iterates `t` times), and the variables `n` and `a` will hold the values of the last test case processed. The variable `tmp` will hold the first element of the last test case's array `a`. The variable `aa` will be a set containing the unique elements of the last test case's array `a`. The variable `cnt` will be 0, and the variable `ans` will hold the minimum number of elements to remove to make the last test case's array non-beautiful, or -1 if it is impossible.**
