### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Checking for All Elements Being the Same:**
   - The function checks if all elements in the array `a` are the same by converting the array to a set `aa` and checking its length.
   - If the length of `aa` is 1, it means all elements are the same, and the function prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - This is correct according to the problem description.

3. **Counting Consecutive Elements:**
   - The function initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp` using the variable `cnt`.
   - When it encounters an element that is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the value of `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Logic for Minimum Removals:**
   - The logic for counting consecutive elements and updating `ans` is intended to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of making all elements the same.
   - However, this logic is flawed because it only considers the longest sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` and does not account for other sequences or the overall structure of the array.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the function correctly identifies that removing one element (e.g., the last `1`) can make the array non-beautiful.
   - For the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the function correctly identifies that removing three elements (e.g., the first three `3`s) can make the array non-beautiful.
   - However, for the array `[2, 2, 2]`, the function prints `-1` which is correct, but for more complex arrays, the function might not always find the correct minimum number of elements to remove.

6. **Flaw in the Logic:**
   - The function only checks the longest sequence of consecutive elements equal to the first element `tmp`. It does not consider other sequences or the possibility of breaking the pattern by removing elements from different sequences.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the function might not correctly identify that removing one element (e.g., the second `2`) can make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly handle all cases where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements. It only considers the longest sequence of consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**False**
