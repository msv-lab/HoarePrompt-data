### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values `a`, `b`, and `m`. The logic of the program is based on the following conditions:

1. **If `m < a` and `m < b`:**  
   In this case, the visibility duration `m` is less than the launch intervals of both installations. Therefore, no two fireworks from different installations can overlap, and the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2 (one from each installation).

2. **If `m < a` and `m > b`:**  
   Here, the visibility duration `m` is less than the launch interval of the first installation but greater than the launch interval of the second installation. This means that fireworks from the second installation can overlap with each other, but not with those from the first installation. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2 (one from the first installation) plus the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility duration `m`.

3. **If `m < b` and `m > a`:**  
   This is the symmetric case to the previous one. The visibility duration `m` is less than the launch interval of the second installation but greater than the launch interval of the first installation. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2 (one from the second installation) plus the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility duration `m`.

4. **If `m >= a` and `m >= b`:**  
   In this case, the visibility duration `m` is greater than or equal to the launch intervals of both installations. This means that fireworks from both installations can overlap with each other. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2 (one from each installation) plus the number of fireworks launched by both installations within the visibility duration `m`.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Case 1:** `m < a` and `m < b`  
  The program correctly prints `2` because no two fireworks from different installations can overlap.

- **Case 2:** `m < a` and `m > b`  
  The program prints `2 + m // b`. This is correct because the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within `m` minutes is `m // b`, and one firework from the first installation can also be visible.

- **Case 3:** `m < b` and `m > a`  
  The program prints `2 + m // a`. This is correct because the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within `m` minutes is `m // a`, and one firework from the second installation can also be visible.

- **Case 4:** `m >= a` and `m >= b`  
  The program prints `m // a + m // b + 2`. This is correct because the number of fireworks launched by both installations within `m` minutes is `m // a` and `m // b`, and one firework from each installation can also be visible.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. The logic is sound and the output matches the expected results for the given examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
