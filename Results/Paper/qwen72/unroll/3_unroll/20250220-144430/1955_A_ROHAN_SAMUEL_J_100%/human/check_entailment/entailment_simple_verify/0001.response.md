### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts (n % 2 == 1)**:
   - The program checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - If `2 * a >= b`, the program calculates the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price, which is `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts (n % 2 == 0)**:
   - The program checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - If `2 * a >= b`, the program calculates the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price, which is `n // 2 * b`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the minimum cost calculated.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
  - Since `n` is even, the program will print `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
  - Correct output: `9`.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
  - Since `n` is odd, the program will print `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - Correct output: `14`.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - Since `n` is odd, the program will print `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
  - Correct output: `15`.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - Since `n` is even, the program will print `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.
  - Correct output: `20`.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for handling both odd and even values of `n` is correct.
- The program correctly calculates the minimum cost by comparing the cost of buying yogurts individually versus buying them in pairs at the promotion price.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the given problem and produces the correct output for the provided example test cases. The logic and the flow of the program are consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
