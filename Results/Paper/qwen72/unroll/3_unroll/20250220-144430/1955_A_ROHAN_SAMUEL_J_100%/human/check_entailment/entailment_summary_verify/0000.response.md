Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. Let's break down the logic of the program and verify it step by step using the provided function summary and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Handling Odd and Even `n`:**
   - **Odd `n`:**
     - If `n` is odd, the function checks if `2 * a` (the cost of two yogurts at the regular price) is less than `b` (the cost of two yogurts at the promotion price).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
     - If `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price).
   - **Even `n`:**
     - If `n` is even, the function checks if `2 * a` is less than `b`.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
     - If `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b` (buying all pairs of yogurts at the promotion price).

3. **Verification of Logic:**
   - **Odd `n`:**
     - If `2 * a < b`, buying all yogurts at the regular price is cheaper. The program correctly prints `a * n`.
     - If `2 * a >= b`, buying pairs at the promotion price and one at the regular price is cheaper. The program correctly prints `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - **Even `n`:**
     - If `2 * a < b`, buying all yogurts at the regular price is cheaper. The program correctly prints `a * n`.
     - If `2 * a >= b`, buying all pairs at the promotion price is cheaper. The program correctly prints `n // 2 * b`.

4. **Example Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - Input: `2 5 9`
     - `n` is even, `2 * a = 10` and `b = 9`.
     - Since `2 * a > b`, the program prints `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
   - **Test Case 2:**
     - Input: `3 5 9`
     - `n` is odd, `2 * a = 10` and `b = 9`.
     - Since `2 * a > b`, the program prints `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - **Test Case 3:**
     - Input: `3 5 11`
     - `n` is odd, `2 * a = 10` and `b = 11`.
     - Since `2 * a < b`, the program prints `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
   - **Test Case 4:**
     - Input: `4 5 11`
     - `n` is even, `2 * a = 10` and `b = 11`.
     - Since `2 * a < b`, the program prints `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
