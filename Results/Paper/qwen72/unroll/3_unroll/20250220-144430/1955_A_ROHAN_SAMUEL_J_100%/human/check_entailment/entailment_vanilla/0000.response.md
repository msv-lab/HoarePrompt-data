### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts (n % 2 == 1)**:
   - If `n` is odd, the program checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper. Therefore, the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the program calculates the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price, which is `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts (n % 2 == 0)**:
   - If `n` is even, the program again checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper. Therefore, the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the program calculates the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price, which is `n // 2 * b`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the minimum cost calculated.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Odd `n`**:
  - If `2 * a < b`, buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
  - If `2 * a >= b`, buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price is cheaper, so the total cost is `n // 2 * b + a`.

- **Even `n`**:
  - If `2 * a < b`, buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
  - If `2 * a >= b`, buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper, so the total cost is `n // 2 * b`.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 9`.
  - Since `n` is even, the program will print `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
  - Correct output: `9`.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
  - Since `n` is odd, the program will print `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - Correct output: `14`.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - Since `n` is odd, the program will print `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
  - Correct output: `15`.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - Since `n` is even, the program will print `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.
  - Correct output: `20`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and calculates the minimum cost based on the given conditions. The logic and output match the problem description and the provided example test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
