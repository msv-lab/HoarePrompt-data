The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function is designed to handle test cases where each test case includes integers `n`, `a`, and `b` with specific ranges. The function is expected to process these test cases and return a result for each case.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

The function will return a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, and returns a result for each test case.**
