Output State: **The function `q` is now defined as a lambda function that prints a query of the form "? d" for a given `d`, flushes the output, and then reads and maps the input to integers. The initial state remains unchanged: the function interacts with a pre-defined graph for each test case, where the graph is a complete undirected graph with n vertices and (n - 2) edges removed. The input n for each test case satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the total number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function can make at most n queries of the form "? d" for each test case, and must output a Hamiltonian path in the form "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n" after determining the path.**
