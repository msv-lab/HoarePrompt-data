To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop iterator, and it starts at 0 by default in the `range` function.
2. **Result of `int(input())`**: This determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the task description, the function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). This means that the input provided to the loop should be a positive integer, and it should be at least 1 to ensure the loop runs.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0**
