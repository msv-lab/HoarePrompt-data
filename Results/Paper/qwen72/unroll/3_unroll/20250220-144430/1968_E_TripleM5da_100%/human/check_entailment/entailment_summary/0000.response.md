Reasoning:  
The program attempts to solve the problem by selecting specific points on the grid for each test case. However, the approach used in the program is not optimal for maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Points**: The program always starts by printing the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\). This is a good start because it ensures that the smallest possible Manhattan distances (0 and 1) are included in \(\mathcal{H}\).

2. **Remaining Points**: For the remaining points, the program prints \((i, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 3 to \(n\). This means that all the remaining points are on the diagonal of the grid starting from \((3, 3)\).

3. **Manhattan Distances**: The Manhattan distances between the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) are:
   - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
   - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
   - \(|1-2| + |1-1| = 1\)
   - \(|1-2| + |1-2| = 2\)

   For the points on the diagonal \((i, i)\), the Manhattan distances between any two points \((i, i)\) and \((j, j)\) are:
   - \(|i-j| + |i-j| = 2|i-j|\)
   - This will generate distances like 2, 4, 6, etc., but not all possible distances.

4. **Maximizing \(\mathcal{H}\)**: To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), we need to ensure that the points are chosen such that they cover a wide range of Manhattan distances. The current approach does not achieve this because it only uses the diagonal points, which results in a limited set of distances.

5. **Optimal Solution**: A better approach would be to choose points that are more spread out. For example, for \(n = 3\), the points \((1, 1)\), \((3, 1)\), and \((1, 3)\) would generate the distances 0, 1, 2, and 4, which is a larger set than the one generated by the current program.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
