Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. For each test case defined by an integer `n`, the function has printed the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), and then (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n. The variable `i` in the loop head is now equal to the number of test cases, and the variable `n` in the loop body is unchanged for each test case.**
