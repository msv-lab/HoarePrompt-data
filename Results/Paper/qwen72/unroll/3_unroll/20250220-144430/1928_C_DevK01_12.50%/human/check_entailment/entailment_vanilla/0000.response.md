### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling are consistent with the described pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned to positions follow a specific sequence: \( 1, 2, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers \( n \) and \( x \).
   - The output is the number of different \( k \) values that fit the given constraints.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must satisfy the pattern.
   - If \( n \) is in the first \( k \) positions, \( x \) must be in the range \( 1 \) to \( k \).
   - If \( n \) is in the next \( k-2 \) positions, \( x \) must be in the range \( k-1 \) to \( 2 \).

4. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - The position \( n \) can be expressed as \( n = (2k - 2) \cdot m + p \) where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( p \) is the position within the current cycle.
   - The number \( x \) received by Vasya must match the position \( p \) within the cycle.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is used to find all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \).
   - It checks if the square root of \( q \) is an integer and adds it to the list if it is.
   - It iterates through all integers from 1 to \( \sqrt{q} \) and adds both the divisor and the quotient to the list if they meet the condition.

6. **Main Logic:**
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is odd. If it is, the answer is 0 because \( y \) must be even for the pattern to hold.
   - It then calls `func_1` with \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \) to find the possible values of \( k \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it calls `func_1` again with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \) to find additional possible values of \( k \).
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
  - It reads \( n \) and \( x \) for each test case.

- **Odd Check:**
  - The program correctly checks if \( y = n + x \) is odd and prints 0 if it is. This is correct because \( y \) must be even for the pattern to hold.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly finds all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \).
  - It handles the square root check and the iteration through divisors correctly.

- **Combining Results:**
  - The program combines the results from two calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates.
  - It prints the length of the resulting list, which is the number of valid \( k \) values.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples. The steps are logically sound and the code is structured to handle the input and output correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
