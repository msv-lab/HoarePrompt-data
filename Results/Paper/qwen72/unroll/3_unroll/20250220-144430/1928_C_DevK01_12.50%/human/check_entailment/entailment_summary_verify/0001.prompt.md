You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two integers `q` and `x` (where 1 <= x < q <= 10^9) and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, including `q` itself if it meets the condition. The values of `q` and `x` remain unchanged.

### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling are consistent with the described pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned to positions follow a specific sequence: \( 1, 2, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers \( n \) and \( x \).
   - The output is the number of different \( k \) values that fit the given constraints.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must satisfy the pattern.
   - If \( n \) is in the first \( k \) positions, \( x \) must be in the range \( 1 \) to \( k \).
   - If \( n \) is in the next \( k-2 \) positions, \( x \) must be in the range \( k-1 \) to \( 2 \).

4. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - The position \( n \) can be expressed as \( n = (2k - 2) \cdot m + p \) where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( p \) is the position within the current cycle.
   - The number \( x \) received by Vasya must match the position \( p \) within the cycle.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is used to find all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \).
   - It checks if the square root of \( q \) is an integer and adds it to the list if it is.
   - It iterates through all integers from 1 to \( \sqrt{q} \) and adds both the divisor and the quotient to the list if they meet the condition.

6. **Main Logic:**
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is odd. If it is, the answer is 0 because \( y \) must be even for the pattern to hold.
   - It then calls `func_1` with \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \) to find the possible values of \( k \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it calls `func_1` again with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \) to find additional possible values of \( k \).
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
  - It reads \( n \) and \( x \) for each test case.

- **Odd Check:**
  - The program correctly checks if \( y = n + x \) is odd and prints 0 if it is. This is correct because \( y \) must be even for the pattern to hold.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly finds all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \).
  - It handles the square root check and the iteration through divisors correctly.

- **Combining Results:**
  - The program combines the results from two calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates.
  - It prints the length of the resulting list, which is the number of valid \( k \) values.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples. The steps are logically sound and the code is structured to handle the input and output correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
