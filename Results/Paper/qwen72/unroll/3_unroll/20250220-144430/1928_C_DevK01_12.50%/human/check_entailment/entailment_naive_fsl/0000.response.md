Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where \( n \) and \( x \) are such that the conditions for \( k \) are not met correctly. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function and the main loop has some issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**:
   - The program calculates `y` as `n + x`. However, based on the problem description, the correct calculation for the position of the number \( x \) in the sequence should be based on the modulo and division operations, not just the sum of \( n \) and \( x \).

2. **Incorrect Condition for Odd `y`**:
   - The program checks if `y % 2 != 0` and prints 0 if true. This condition is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \), the program incorrectly prints 0 because \( y = 12 \) is even, but the correct answer should be 4 as per the problem description.

3. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of a number, but the logic inside it is flawed. It incorrectly checks for divisors and adds them to the list `M`. The condition `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1` is not necessary and can be misleading. Additionally, the loop `for i in range(1, int(w // 1))` should be `for i in range(1, int(w) + 1)` to include all potential divisors.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Divisors**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the divisors to determine the valid \( k \) values. The logic for adding divisors to the list `M` and checking if they are valid \( k \) values is flawed.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:
- For \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \), the correct output should be 4 (as \( k = 2, 3, 5, 6 \) are valid), but the program prints 0 because it incorrectly checks the condition `y % 2 != 0`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
