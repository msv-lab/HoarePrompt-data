Functionality: ** The function `func_1` is intended to process multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list. However, the provided code does not implement any functionality, as it only contains a placeholder `pass` statement. Therefore, from the user's perspective, the function does not perform any actions and does not return any results. The state of the program remains unchanged after the function call. **
