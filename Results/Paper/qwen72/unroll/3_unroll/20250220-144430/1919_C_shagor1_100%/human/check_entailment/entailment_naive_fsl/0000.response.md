Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order. In such a case, the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to keep all elements in one subsequence, which would result in a penalty of 0. However, the given program does not correctly handle this scenario. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The expected output is 0, but the program will output 3, which is incorrect. The issue arises because the program incorrectly increments the penalty when it should not.
