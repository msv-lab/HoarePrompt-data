You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: The list `a` will have each of its elements increased by their respective index plus one. The integer `n` and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged.
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: The list `a` remains sorted in descending order, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` (all frequencies are 0), `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is a list that contains the elements of `a` in descending order with additional elements inserted to make the total length of `ans` equal to `n`.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: The list `a` remains sorted in descending order, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` (all frequencies are 0), `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is a list that contains the elements of `a` in descending order with additional elements inserted to make the total length of `ans` equal to `n + cnt`, where the additional elements are consecutive integers starting from the last element of `ans` and decreasing by 1.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: 5 4 3 2 1 (where `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns the results for all test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
