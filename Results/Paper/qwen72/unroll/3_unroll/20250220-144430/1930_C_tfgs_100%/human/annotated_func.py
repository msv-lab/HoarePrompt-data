#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: The list `a` will have each of its elements increased by their respective index plus one. The integer `n` and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged.
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: The list `a` remains sorted in descending order, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` (all frequencies are 0), `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is a list that contains the elements of `a` in descending order with additional elements inserted to make the total length of `ans` equal to `n`.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: The list `a` remains sorted in descending order, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` (all frequencies are 0), `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is a list that contains the elements of `a` in descending order with additional elements inserted to make the total length of `ans` equal to `n + cnt`, where the additional elements are consecutive integers starting from the last element of `ans` and decreasing by 1.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: 5 4 3 2 1 (where `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a single test case where it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input. It then increments each element of `a` by its index plus one. After processing, the function constructs a list `ans` that contains the elements of `a` in descending order, with additional elements inserted to ensure the length of `ans` is equal to `n`. The additional elements are chosen to be the largest possible values that do not violate the descending order and are not already present in `a`. The function prints the elements of `ans` as a space-separated list. The function does not return any value.
