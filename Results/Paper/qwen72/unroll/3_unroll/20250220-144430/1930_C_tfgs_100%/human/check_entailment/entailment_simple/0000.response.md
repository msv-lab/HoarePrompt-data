### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`**:
   - The program correctly modifies the array `a` by adding the index plus one to each element: `a[i] += i + 1`. This step is necessary to simulate the insertion of `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

3. **Handling Duplicates**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to track the frequency of each element in the modified array `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.

4. **Constructing the Result Array `ans`**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the result.
   - It iterates over the sorted elements of `a` and appends them to `ans`.
   - To ensure the array `ans` is lexicographically largest, it also inserts additional elements that are not present in `a` but can be inserted to fill the gaps. This is done by checking the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list and inserting the maximum possible number of elements that fit within the constraints.

5. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After the main loop, if there are still elements to be added to `ans` (tracked by `cnt`), it appends consecutive decreasing integers to `ans` to make its length equal to `n`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` in a single line, which is the correct format for the output.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and produce the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case. The steps taken to modify the array, handle duplicates, and construct the result array are logically sound and align with the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
