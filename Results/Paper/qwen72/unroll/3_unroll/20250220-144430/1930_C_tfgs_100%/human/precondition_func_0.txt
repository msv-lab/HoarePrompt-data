The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
