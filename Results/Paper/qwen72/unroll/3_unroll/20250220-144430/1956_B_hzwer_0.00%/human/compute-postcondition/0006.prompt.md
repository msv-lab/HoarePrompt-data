Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the number of cards each player receives and the integers on the cards in your hand, respectively. Each integer from 1 to n appears in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer. `cards` is a list of integers input by the user. `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) initialized with zeros, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is set to 0 and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is set to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
    for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
        elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1]
                )


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
