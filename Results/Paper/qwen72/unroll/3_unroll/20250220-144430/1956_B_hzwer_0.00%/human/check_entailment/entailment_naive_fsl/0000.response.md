Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, the dynamic programming (DP) approach used in the function `func_1` does not accurately model the optimal play strategy for both players, especially for Nene, who always plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```
The expected output is `1`, as explained in the problem description. However, the program's logic in the DP table does not correctly account for the optimal play strategy. The program will likely produce an incorrect result because it does not properly consider the state transitions and the optimal moves for both players.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect DP Initialization and Base Cases**:
   - The initialization of `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` to `0` is not clear and may not be correct for all cases.
   - The base cases for the DP table are not well-defined, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **State Transitions**:
   - The state transitions in the DP table do not accurately reflect the game's rules. For example, the transition `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])` does not correctly handle the scenario where Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

3. **Handling of Card Counts**:
   - The program uses `cards.count(j + 1)` to count the occurrences of a card in the list, which is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results in the DP table. This method is called multiple times in the loop, which can be very slow for large inputs.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a greedy algorithm or a more carefully designed DP solution that accurately models the optimal play for both players. The current program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
