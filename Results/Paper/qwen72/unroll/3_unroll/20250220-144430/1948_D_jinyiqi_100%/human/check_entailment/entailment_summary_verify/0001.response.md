### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to replace each question mark in the string `s` with a lowercase Latin letter to maximize the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat.
   - A tandem repeat is a string of even length where the first half is equal to the second half.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the string `s` and converts it to a list of characters.
   - It initializes `n` to the length of the string.
   - It iterates over possible lengths of the tandem repeat from `n // 2` down to `1` (i.e., from the largest possible half-length to the smallest).
   - For each half-length `j`, it iterates over the string to check if a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` can be formed.
   - It uses a `count` variable to keep track of how many characters in the first half match the corresponding characters in the second half or are question marks.
   - If `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` can be formed, and it prints `2 * j` and returns.
   - If no tandem repeat is found, it prints `0`.

4. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The program correctly checks for the largest possible tandem repeat by starting with the largest half-length and working downwards.
   - The `count` variable is used to ensure that the characters in the first half can match the characters in the second half or are question marks.
   - If a tandem repeat is found, it prints the length and returns, ensuring that the largest possible tandem repeat is printed for each test case.
   - If no tandem repeat is found, it prints `0`, which is the correct output for such cases.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string contains only question marks correctly. For example, for the input `?????`, it will correctly identify that the longest possible tandem repeat is `4` by forming `aabb`.
   - It also handles the case where the string contains no question marks but no tandem repeat can be formed. For example, for the input `codeforces`, it will correctly print `0`.
   - The program ensures that the total length of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 5000, as required by the problem constraints.

6. **Function Summary Verification**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. It correctly states that the function reads a string, processes it to find the longest tandem repeat, and prints the result.
   - The function does not modify the input string or any other variables, which is consistent with the problem constraints and the provided code.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by finding the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring after replacing question marks. It follows the logic and constraints provided in the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
