#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving a string `s` and multiple test cases, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include a parameter for the list of strings or test cases. Assuming the function should take a list of strings as input, the precondition would be: `test_cases is a list of strings, where each string s in test_cases consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and 1 <= len(s) <= 5000. The total length of all strings in test_cases does not exceed 5000.`
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The loop does not modify the variables `test_cases`, `s`, or `n`. The loop may print a value `count * 2` if a specific condition is met, but the variables `test_cases`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a single string `s` from user input, where `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 characters. It then processes this string to find the longest substring that is repeated at a distance of `j` (where `j` is a positive integer less than or equal to half the length of `s`) and contains only question marks or matching characters. If such a substring is found, it prints the length of this substring multiplied by 2 and returns. If no such substring is found, it prints `0` and returns. The function does not modify the input string or any other variables.
