The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts from `n // 2` and decrements `j` by 1 until `j` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since `n // 2` must be at least 1 for the loop to start).

State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, where each string `s` in `test_cases` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and 1 <= len(s) <= 5000. The total length of all strings in `test_cases` does not exceed 5000. `s` is a list of characters, where each character is from the input string. `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`**
