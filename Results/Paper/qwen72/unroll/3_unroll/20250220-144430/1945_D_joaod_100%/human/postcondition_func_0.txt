The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost to move an item from a specified initial position to a final position, considering two different cost lists. The function prints the minimum cost for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are not modified by the function, and the function does not return any value.
