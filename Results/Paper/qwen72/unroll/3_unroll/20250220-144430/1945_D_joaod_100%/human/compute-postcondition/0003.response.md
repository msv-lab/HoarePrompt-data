The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the lengths of the lists and a specific constraint.
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b` is a list of integers of length `n` such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` and return a result based on these inputs, which is not explicitly defined in the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, and returns a result based on these inputs, which is not explicitly defined in the provided constraints.**
