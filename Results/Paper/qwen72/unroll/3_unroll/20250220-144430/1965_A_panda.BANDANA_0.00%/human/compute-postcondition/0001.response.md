To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as is typical for a `range(t)` loop. The other variables and conditions (like `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
