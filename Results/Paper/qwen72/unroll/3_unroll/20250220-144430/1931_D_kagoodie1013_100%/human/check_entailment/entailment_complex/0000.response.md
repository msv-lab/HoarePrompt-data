Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases. A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by parsing the necessary integers and storing them in a list of tuples, `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a `count` to zero and a `residue_map` to store the residues of the array elements modulo \(x\) and \(y\).
   - It then iterates over each element in the array `arr`:
     - For each element `num`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
       - `r_x` is the residue of \(-num\) modulo \(x\).
       - `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo \(y\).
     - It checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) is already in `residue_map` and adds the count of such pairs to `count`.
     - It updates `residue_map` with the current element's residues \((num \mod x, num \mod y)\).

3. **Output:**
   - The function appends the `count` of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list, which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Verification of the Logic:

- **Residue Calculation:**
  - The calculation of `r_x` as \(-num \mod x\) is correct because it ensures that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) if the residues of \(-a_i\) and \(a_j\) are the same.
  - The calculation of `r_y` as `num % y` is correct because it ensures that \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\) if the residues of \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) are the same.

- **Counting Pairs:**
  - The program correctly counts the number of pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\) by using the `residue_map` to keep track of the residues seen so far.
  - For each element `num`, it checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) is already in `residue_map` and adds the count of such pairs to `count`.
  - It then updates `residue_map` with the current element's residues, ensuring that future elements can be checked against these residues.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The input handling, residue calculation, and pair counting are all performed correctly according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
