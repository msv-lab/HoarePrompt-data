Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, parsing the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the array `arr` for each test case.
   - The parsed values are stored in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - For each test case, the function initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
   - For each number `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates two residues:
     - `r_x = -num % x` which is the residue of `-num` when divided by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` which is the residue of `num` when divided by `y`.
   - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` already exists in the `residue_map` and adds the count of such pairs to `count`.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current key `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Conditions for Beautiful Pairs**:
   - A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful if:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
   - The program correctly checks these conditions by using the residues:
     - For \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), \((a_i \mod x) + (a_j \mod x)\) should be zero or a multiple of \(x\).
     - For \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), \((a_i \mod y) - (a_j \mod y)\) should be zero or a multiple of \(y\).

4. **Residue Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `r_x` as \(-num \mod x\) and `r_y` as \(num \mod y\).
   - This is correct because:
     - \(-num \mod x\) gives the residue that, when added to `num`, will make the sum divisible by \(x\).
     - \(num \mod y\) gives the residue that, when subtracted from `num`, will make the difference divisible by \(y\).

5. **Counting Pairs**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of pairs by checking if the current pair of residues \((r_x, r_y)\) exists in the `residue_map`.
   - It then updates the `residue_map` with the current key \((num \mod x, num \mod y)\).

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which is the number of beautiful pairs.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
