Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once and processes it into test cases, storing each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`.

2. **Residue Calculation**: For each test case, the program calculates the residues of each element in the array `arr` with respect to `x` and `y`. This is done using the expressions `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the count of pairs that satisfy the conditions. For each element `num` in the array:
   - It calculates the current residues `r_x` and `r_y`.
   - It checks if there is a pair `(a_i, a_j)` where `a_i` has residues `(r_x, r_y)` and `a_j` has residues `(-num % x, num % y)`.
   - It increments the count by the number of such pairs found in `residue_map`.
   - It updates `residue_map` with the current element's residues.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The logic ensures that for each pair of indices `(i, j)` where `i < j`, the conditions `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` are checked efficiently using the residue map. This approach handles all edge cases and potential inputs within the given constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
