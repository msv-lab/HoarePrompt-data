### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over the test cases, extracting `n`, `x`, and `y` from the list and the array `arr` of length `n`.
   - This approach is efficient and correctly parses the input as described in the problem statement.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a `count` variable to zero, which will store the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It also initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to keep track of the residues of the array elements modulo `x` and `y`.

3. **Residue Calculation:**
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, the program calculates:
     - `r_x = -num % x`: This is the residue of `-num` modulo `x`. This is used to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y`: This is the residue of `num` modulo `y`. This is used to check if `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - The program then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of such pairs to `count`.

4. **Updating Residue Map:**
   - The program updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues modulo `x` and `y` using `current_key = (num % x, num % y)`.
   - This ensures that the map keeps track of the number of elements that have the same residues.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, the program appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The program correctly identifies the residues needed to check the conditions for a beautiful pair.
- However, there is a subtle issue in the logic:
  - The condition for a beautiful pair is that both `a_i + a_j` and `a_i - a_j` must be divisible by `x` and `y` respectively.
  - The current implementation checks if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` using `r_x = -num % x` and if `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` using `r_y = num % y`.
  - This approach is correct for checking `a_i - a_j` but not for `a_i + a_j`. The correct residue for `a_i + a_j` should be `num % x` and `num % y` for both conditions.

### Corrected Logic:
- To correctly count the beautiful pairs, the program should use the same residues for both conditions:
  - `r_x = num % x`
  - `r_y = num % y`
- This ensures that both conditions are checked correctly.

### Conclusion:
- The current implementation is incorrect because it uses `-num % x` for the first condition, which is not the correct way to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        residue_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            r_x = num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = (r_x, r_y)
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    return results
```

This fix ensures that the program correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs as described in the problem statement.
