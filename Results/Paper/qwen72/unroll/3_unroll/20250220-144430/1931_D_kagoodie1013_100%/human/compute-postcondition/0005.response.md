The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` (an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and `y` (an integer such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9). Each test case is followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list `results` which contains the count of pairs (i, j) for each test case, where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and (a_i + a_j) is divisible by both `x` and `y`. The list `test_cases` remains unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers. It returns a list of results, where each result is the count of pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and the sum (a_i + a_j) is divisible by both x and y. The input list of test cases remains unchanged.**
