Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (n, x, y, and the array `arr`).

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues of the elements in the array modulo `x` and `y`.

3. **Finding Beautiful Pairs**:
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
     - `r_x = -num % x` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` already exists in `residue_map` and adds the count of such pairs to `count`.
   - It then updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues `(num % x, num % y)`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them.

The logic ensures that for each pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (where \(1 \le i < j \le n\)), the conditions for a beautiful pair are checked using the residues. The use of the dictionary `residue_map` efficiently keeps track of the counts of residues, allowing the program to determine the number of beautiful pairs in linear time relative to the size of the array.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
