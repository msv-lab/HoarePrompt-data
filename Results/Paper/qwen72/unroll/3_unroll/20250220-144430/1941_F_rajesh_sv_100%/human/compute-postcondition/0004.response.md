Functionality: ** The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It calls `func_3` to get a number of test cases, and then iterates that many times, calling `func_6` in each iteration. After the function concludes, the variable `testcases` retains the value returned by `func_3`, and no other variables are affected. The function does not return any value. **
