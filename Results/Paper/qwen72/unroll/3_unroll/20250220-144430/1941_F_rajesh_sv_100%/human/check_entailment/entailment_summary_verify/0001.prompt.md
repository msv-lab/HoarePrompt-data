You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It calls `func_3` to get a number of test cases, and then iterates that many times, calling `func_6` in each iteration. After the function concludes, the variable `testcases` retains the value returned by `func_3`, and no other variables are affected. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses a series of functions to handle input. `func_2` reads a line from the input, `func_3` reads an integer, and `func_4` reads a list of integers. These functions are used to parse the input for each test case.
   - `func_5` is defined but not used in the program.

2. **Main Function (`func_6`)**:
   - The function `func_6` processes each test case.
   - It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It reads the list of complexities `A` of the prepared problems.
   - It reads the list of complexities `D` of the models and sorts it while removing duplicates.
   - It reads the list of complexities `F` of the functions.
   - It initializes `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` to store the maximum difference between consecutive complexities in `A`, the second maximum difference, and the index where the maximum difference occurs.
   - It iterates through the list `A` to find the maximum difference and the index where it occurs.

3. **Finding the Minimum Imbalance**:
   - The program identifies the largest gap in the sorted list `A` and the index where this gap occurs.
   - It then tries to insert a new problem complexity `D[i] + F[j]` into this gap to minimize the imbalance.
   - It uses binary search (`bisect_right` and `bisect_left`) to find the appropriate position in the sorted list `D` to insert the new complexity.
   - It calculates the potential new imbalance by considering the new complexity and updates the answer if the new imbalance is smaller.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum imbalance that can be achieved by adding at most one problem.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no new problem is added by printing the maximum difference found in the original list `A`.
   - It also ensures that the second maximum difference is considered to avoid cases where the new problem does not improve the imbalance.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of binary search (`bisect_right` and `bisect_left`) ensures that the program efficiently finds the appropriate position to insert the new complexity.
   - The program processes each test case in a reasonable time, given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum imbalance by adding at most one problem. It handles the input and output correctly, and the binary search ensures efficient processing. The logic for finding the minimum imbalance by considering the largest gap and potential new complexities is sound.
