Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a callable function `func` and returns a callable function named `wrapper`. The function `func_1` does not modify any input parameters and does not perform any actions other than creating and returning the `wrapper` function.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `wrapper` accepts no parameters and returns the result of `func(*args)` if `args` is not already a key in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is already a key in `d`, it returns the value associated with `args` in `d`. The function ensures that `d` contains the result of `func(*args)` for the given `args` after the function concludes.

    #The program returns the first line of input from the user, with any trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads the first line of input from the user via `sys.stdin`, removes any trailing whitespace from this line, and returns the resulting string. The function does not modify any external variables or state.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` takes no parameters and returns no value. It operates on three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and three lists `A`, `D`, and `F` that are provided by the `func_4` function. The function identifies the maximum and second maximum differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `A`. It then calculates a new value `ans` by finding the minimum of the maximum differences between the adjusted elements of `D` and the elements `left` and `right` from `A` (where `left` and `right` are the elements around the maximum difference in `A`). Finally, it prints the maximum of `ans` and `next_max_diff`. The state of `A`, `D`, and `F` remains unchanged, and the function does not modify any global variables or have any side effects other than printing the result.

        func_6()
        
    #State: `testcases` remains the value returned by `func_3()`, and no other variables are affected.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It calls `func_3` to get a number of test cases, and then iterates that many times, calling `func_6` in each iteration. After the function concludes, the variable `testcases` retains the value returned by `func_3`, and no other variables are affected. The function does not return any value.
