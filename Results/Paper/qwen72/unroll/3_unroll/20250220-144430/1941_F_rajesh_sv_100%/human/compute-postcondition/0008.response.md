Output State: **`A` remains the list returned by `func_4()`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` remains a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()` where 1 <= D[i] <= 10^9, `F` remains the list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the maximum difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `A[index - 1]` to `left` and the value of `A[index]` to `right`.
- All other variables (`A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index`) remain unchanged.
- `left` is now the element in `A` just before the element at `index`.
- `right` is now the element in `A` at `index`.
