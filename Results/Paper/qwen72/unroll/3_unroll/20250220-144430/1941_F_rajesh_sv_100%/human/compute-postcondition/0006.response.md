Output State: `A` remains the list returned by `func_4()`, `n` remains the value returned by `func_4()`, `m` remains the value returned by `func_4()`, `k` remains the value returned by `func_4()`, `D` remains a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()` where 1 <= D[i] <= 10^9, `F` remains the list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs.
