### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves 2n cards, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that each player (you and Nene) gets n cards.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize your score, you should try to play cards that you know Nene has a duplicate of, so that you can score a point when she plays her duplicate.
   - Nene, being optimal, will try to play cards that you do not have a duplicate of, or if she has to play a card you have a duplicate of, she will do so in a way that minimizes your points.

3. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1(n, a)` is designed to calculate the maximum number of points you can score.
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs of cards you have (`pairs = sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))`).
   - The function returns `min(pairs, n // 2)`, which is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and half the number of cards you have. This is because you can only score a point for a card if Nene has the duplicate, and you can only play up to `n // 2` pairs in your `n` turns.

4. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2()` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the value of `n` and the list of cards `a` from the input data.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a)` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

5. **Input Handling:**
   - The input is read in a single call to `sys.stdin.read`, which is efficient for large inputs.
   - The index `idx` is used to keep track of the current position in the input data, ensuring that the correct values are extracted for each test case.

6. **Output:**
   - The output is correct for each test case, as it prints the result of `func_1(n, a)` for each test case.

### Validation of Original Assessment:

- **Function 1:**
  - The logic of counting pairs and returning the minimum of pairs and `n // 2` is correct. This ensures that you only count the pairs you can actually play to score points, and you cannot exceed `n // 2` pairs since you only have `n` turns.
  - The use of `Counter` is appropriate for counting the occurrences of each card.

- **Function 2:**
  - The input handling is efficient and correctly processes multiple test cases.
  - The extraction of `n` and `a` for each test case is done correctly using the index `idx`.
  - The results are correctly appended to the `results` list and printed at the end.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally. The input handling and output are also correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
