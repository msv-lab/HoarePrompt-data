The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer in `a` is between 1 and `n` and appears at most 2 times. It returns the minimum value between the number of integers in `a` that appear exactly 2 times and half of the total number of integers in `a` (`n // 2`). The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `n`.
