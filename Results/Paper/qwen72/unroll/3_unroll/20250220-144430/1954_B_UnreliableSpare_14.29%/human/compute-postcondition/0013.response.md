To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the precondition and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `flag` is `False`.
   - The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
   - `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered.
   - `val` is `arr[0]`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` at the end of the loop.

2. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - `ans` is defined as the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered. This means `ans` is the number of times `arr[0]` appears consecutively at the beginning of the list `arr` until a different element is found.

3. **Understanding `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` at the end of the loop. This means `cnt` is the number of times `arr[0]` appears consecutively at the beginning of the list `arr` until a different element is found.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `ans` and `cnt` are both defined in the same way (the count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` at the beginning of the list), they will have the same value.
   - Therefore, `ans` will be the count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` at the beginning of the list.

Given the precondition, the `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` at the beginning of the list `arr`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of consecutive elements equal to arr[0] at the beginning of the list arr)**
