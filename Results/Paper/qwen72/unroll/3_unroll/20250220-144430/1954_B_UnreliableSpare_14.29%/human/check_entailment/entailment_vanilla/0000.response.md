### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Checking if All Elements are the Same**:
   - The program uses a flag `flag` to check if all elements in the array are the same.
   - It iterates through the array and sets `flag` to `False` if it finds any two consecutive elements that are different.
   - If `flag` remains `True`, it means all elements are the same, and the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Therefore, it prints `-1`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**:
   - If the array is not all the same, the program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to represent an initially large value.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the number of occurrences of the first element `val`.
   - For each element, if it is equal to `val`, it increments the count `cnt`.
   - If it is not equal to `val`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to ensure the count of the last segment is considered.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element (which is always beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements).
   - It also correctly handles the case where all elements are the same (which is always beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements).

5. **Algorithmic Correctness**:
   - The logic for checking if all elements are the same is correct.
   - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only checks the count of the first element and does not consider other elements or the structure of the array.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers the count of the first element, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

### Example:
- For the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will count the number of `1`s and `2`s but will not correctly determine that removing one element (e.g., the last `1`) is enough to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correctness: **False**
