The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start at 1, which is the first value in the range.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `flag` is `True`**
