Postcondition: ***`flag` remains `False` if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different; otherwise, `flag` remains `True`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered. `val` is `arr[0]`, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` at the end of the loop. If `flag` is `True`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the original `ans` and `cnt`. If `flag` is `False`, `ans` remains the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered.***
