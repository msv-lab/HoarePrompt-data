You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the beautiful array, and an integer `n` representing the length of the array. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided as an input parameter. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: The value of `flag` will be `False` if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different. Otherwise, `flag` will remain `True`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` will remain unchanged.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: `flag` remains `False` if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different; otherwise, `flag` remains `True`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered. `val` is `arr[0]`, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` at the end of the loop.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the count of consecutive elements equal to arr[0] at the beginning of the list arr)
    #State: *`flag` remains `False` if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different; otherwise, `flag` remains `True`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered. `val` is `arr[0]`, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` at the end of the loop. If `flag` is `True`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the original `ans` and `cnt`. If `flag` is `False`, `ans` remains the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` before a different element is encountered and prints this count. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array is already not beautiful, or where the array can be made not beautiful by removing fewer elements than the current logic suggests. Specifically, the program calculates the minimum number of consecutive elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful, but it does not consider all possible scenarios where the array can be made not beautiful.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 1 3 1
```
The array is beautiful because we can perform the operation on index 2 (a_2 = 2) to make it [1, 1, 1, 3, 1], and then on index 3 (a_3 = 1) to make it [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. However, the program will output 1, which is incorrect because the array can be made not beautiful by removing just one element (e.g., removing the 3 at index 3).

The program should consider all possible ways to make the array not beautiful, not just the consecutive elements.
