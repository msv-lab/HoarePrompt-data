You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` before a different element is encountered and prints this count. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Checking if All Elements are the Same**:
   - The program uses a flag `flag` to check if all elements in the array are the same.
   - It iterates through the array and sets `flag` to `False` if it finds any two consecutive elements that are different.
   - If `flag` remains `True`, it means all elements are the same, and the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Therefore, it prints `-1`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**:
   - If the array is not all the same, the program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to represent an initially large value.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the number of occurrences of the first element `val`.
   - For each element, if it is equal to `val`, it increments the count `cnt`.
   - If it is not equal to `val`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to ensure the count of the last segment is considered.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element (which is always beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements).
   - It also correctly handles the case where all elements are the same (which is always beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements).

5. **Algorithmic Correctness**:
   - The logic for checking if all elements are the same is correct.
   - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only checks the count of the first element and does not consider other elements or the structure of the array.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers the count of the first element, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

### Example:
- For the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will count the number of `1`s and `2`s but will not correctly determine that removing one element (e.g., the last `1`) is enough to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correctness: **False**
