### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a flaw in the program's logic. Let's break down the issues and the reasoning step by step:

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case by reading the integer `n` and the list `arr`.
   - It first checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.
   - If not all elements are the same, it calculates the minimum number of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` before a different element is encountered and prints this count.

2. **Original Assessment**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is already not beautiful, or where the array can be made not beautiful by removing fewer elements than the current logic suggests.
   - Specifically, the program calculates the minimum number of consecutive elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful, but it does not consider all possible scenarios where the array can be made not beautiful.

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     Input:
     1
     5
     1 2 1 3 1
     ```
   - The array is beautiful because we can perform the operation on index 2 (a_2 = 2) to make it [1, 1, 1, 3, 1], and then on index 3 (a_3 = 1) to make it [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
   - However, the program will output 1, which is incorrect because the array can be made not beautiful by removing just one element (e.g., removing the 3 at index 3).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible ways to make the array not beautiful.
   - One approach is to find the minimum number of elements to remove such that no valid operation can be performed to make all elements the same.
   - This involves checking if there is any element that, when removed, disrupts the ability to perform the operation on any index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) where `a[i-1] = a[i+1]`.

5. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program only considers the minimum number of consecutive elements equal to the first element before a different element is encountered.
   - This approach is too narrow and does not account for other elements that can be removed to make the array not beautiful.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic is flawed because it does not consider all possible ways to make the array not beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
