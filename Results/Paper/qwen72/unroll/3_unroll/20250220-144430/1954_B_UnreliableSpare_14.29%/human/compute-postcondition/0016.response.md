Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` before a different element is encountered and prints this count. The function does not return any value. **
