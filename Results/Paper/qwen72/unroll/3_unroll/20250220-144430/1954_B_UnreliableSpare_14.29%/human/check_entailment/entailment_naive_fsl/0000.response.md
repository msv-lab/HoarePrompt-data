Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array is already not beautiful, or where the array can be made not beautiful by removing fewer elements than the current logic suggests. Specifically, the program calculates the minimum number of consecutive elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful, but it does not consider all possible scenarios where the array can be made not beautiful.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 1 3 1
```
The array is beautiful because we can perform the operation on index 2 (a_2 = 2) to make it [1, 1, 1, 3, 1], and then on index 3 (a_3 = 1) to make it [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. However, the program will output 1, which is incorrect because the array can be made not beautiful by removing just one element (e.g., removing the 3 at index 3).

The program should consider all possible ways to make the array not beautiful, not just the consecutive elements.
