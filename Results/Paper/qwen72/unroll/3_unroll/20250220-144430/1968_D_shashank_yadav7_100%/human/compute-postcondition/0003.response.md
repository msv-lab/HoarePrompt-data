The function `func` is intended to accept multiple parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the length of the permutation), `k` (the number of turns), `P_B` and `P_S` (the starting positions), `p` (the permutation), and `a` (the array). Each `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `P_B` and `P_S` are positive integers within the range of the permutation, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and `a` is an array of positive integers.

However, the provided function definition is missing these parameters. Assuming the function is correctly defined with these parameters, the functionality of the function `func` is to process the given test cases and return the result based on the provided parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. It processes the test cases and returns the result based on the given parameters.**
