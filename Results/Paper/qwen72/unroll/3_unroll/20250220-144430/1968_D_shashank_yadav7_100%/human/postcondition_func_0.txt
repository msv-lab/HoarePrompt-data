The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` (adjusted to 0-based indices), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. It then calculates the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` for two players (Bodya and Sasha) based on the permutation and the array, and prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' depending on which score is higher or if they are equal. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes.
