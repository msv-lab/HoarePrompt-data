#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters as described in the problem, but the actual function definition is missing these parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. Each `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `P_B` and `P_S` are positive integers within the range of the permutation, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and `a` is an array of positive integers.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        
        s -= 1
        
        sp = a[s]
        
        bp = a[b]
        
        bm = a[b] * k
        
        sm = a[s] * k
        
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is reduced by the number of iterations that were executed, and for each iteration, the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, and `a` are updated according to the loop body. Specifically, `b` and `s` are indices that are updated by following the permutation `p` and are decremented by 1. `bm` and `sm` are updated to the maximum possible values based on the current and previous values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` multiplied by `k`. `sp` and `bp` accumulate the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively. The loop prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm` for each iteration. The initial values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` are not directly affected by the loop, but their values within each iteration are used to compute the results.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` (adjusted to 0-based indices), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. It then calculates the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` for two players (Bodya and Sasha) based on the permutation and the array, and prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' depending on which score is higher or if they are equal. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes.
