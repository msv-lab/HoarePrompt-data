Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the scores and positions for each player. The issue lies in the way the scores and positions are updated within the loop. The program should simulate the game for exactly `k` turns, but it incorrectly decrements `k` within the loop, which can lead to the game not being played for the full `k` turns.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
Bodya
```

Actual Output:
```
Draw
```

In the provided input, the game should last for 2 turns. However, the program incorrectly updates the positions and scores, leading to an incorrect result. The correct simulation should show that Bodya ends up with a higher score, but the program incorrectly concludes a draw.
