The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, as is the default behavior of `range(t)`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
