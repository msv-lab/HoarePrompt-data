Reasoning:

The program is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm" and splits it into `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes).

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the hour part from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
   - For hours from '01' to '11', the program correctly assigns the hour to `h1` and sets `time` to 'AM'.
   - For hour '12', the program correctly assigns '12' to `h1` and sets `time` to 'PM'.
   - For hours from '13' to '23', the program correctly converts the hour to the corresponding 12-hour format and sets `time` to 'PM'.
   - For hour '00', the program correctly assigns '12' to `h1` and sets `time` to 'AM'.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" using the `print` function with the `sep` parameter to ensure the correct format.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as '00:00' converting to '12:00 AM' and '12:00' converting to '12:00 PM'.

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.
   - The logic for converting hours and minutes is correct and follows the rules of the 24-hour to 12-hour conversion.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
