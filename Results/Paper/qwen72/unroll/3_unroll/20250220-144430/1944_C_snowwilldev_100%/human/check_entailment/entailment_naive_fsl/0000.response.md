Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the MEX can be determined by simply counting the occurrences of each number and checking when the count of a number is 1 or 0. This approach does not consider the optimal moves of the players.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- **Optimal Play:**
  - Alice picks 2 (since 2 is the highest number and appears twice, she can ensure it is included in `c`).
  - Bob picks 2 (to minimize the MEX, he picks the other 2).
  - Alice picks 1.
  - Bob picks 0.
  - The final array `c` is `[2, 1]`, and the MEX is 3.

- **Program's Output:**
  - The program counts the occurrences of each number and returns the first number `i` for which `cnt[i] == 0` or `t >= 2`.
  - It counts `0` (1 time), `1` (1 time), and `2` (2 times).
  - It returns `2` because `cnt[2] == 2` and `t == 2` after counting `0` and `1`.

This shows that the program does not correctly simulate the optimal play of Alice and Bob, leading to an incorrect result.
