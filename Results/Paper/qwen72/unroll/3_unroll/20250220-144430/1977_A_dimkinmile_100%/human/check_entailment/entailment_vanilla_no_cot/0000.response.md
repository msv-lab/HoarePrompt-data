Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it calls `func_1()` before defining it. In Python, functions must be defined before they are called. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `n < m`, which should always result in "No" because it's impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves if all moves are adding or removing one cube at a time.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version ensures that `func_1()` is called after it is defined and correctly handles the case where `n < m`.
