Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Default Value for `defaultdict`**:
   - The program uses `defaultdict(default_value)` but does not define `default_value`. This will result in a `NameError` when the program is run. The correct way to define a `defaultdict` with a default value of 0 is `defaultdict(int)`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Missing Problems**:
   - The program calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by checking if the count of that difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`. If it is, it adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`. However, this logic is incorrect because it should be checking if the count of that difficulty level is less than `m` and adding `m - d[val]` to `ans` only if `d[val] < m`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version initializes the `defaultdict` with `int` and correctly calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level.
