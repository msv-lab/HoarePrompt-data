The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `cases` contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function always returns 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple in `cases` contains two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function always returns 0.**
