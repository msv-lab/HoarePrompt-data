The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, cases):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
