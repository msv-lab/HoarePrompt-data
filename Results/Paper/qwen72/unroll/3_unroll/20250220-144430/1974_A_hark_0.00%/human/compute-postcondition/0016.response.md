Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and `x` and `y` are now assigned the values provided by the user input. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `x` is updated to `x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, and `bxsfory1` is set to `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` if `x` is greater than 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is 0. If either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0, no changes are made to `x` and `y`.***
