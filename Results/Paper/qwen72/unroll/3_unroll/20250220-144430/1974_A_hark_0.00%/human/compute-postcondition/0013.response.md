The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(0)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
   - `x` and `y` are assigned values provided by the user input.
   - Either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer `0`.

### Explanation:
- The values of `x` and `y` are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is hardcoded to print the integer `0`.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
