Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the calculation of the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Specifically, in `func_2`, the line:

```python
x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
```

This line is intended to adjust the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) after placing the 2x2 icons, but it incorrectly subtracts `bxsfory * 15` and then adds `y * 4`. This does not correctly account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons and the remaining space available for 1x1 icons.

### Case When the Program Does Not Work Correctly:
Consider the input `x = 15` and `y = 1`. According to the problem description, the minimum number of screens required should be 1, because one 2x2 icon can be placed, and the remaining 11 cells can accommodate all 15 1x1 icons.

However, the program calculates:
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1`
- `x = 15 - 1 * 15 + 1 * 4 = 15 - 15 + 4 = 4`

Then, it calculates:
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(4 / 15) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`

So, the program outputs `3` instead of the correct answer `1`.

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
