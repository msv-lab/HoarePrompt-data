You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

def func():
    t = int(input())
    buffer = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
        if n >= 3:
            q = [0 for j in range(n + 1)]
            for j in range(n):
                q[w[j]] += 1
            eta = []
            for j in range(n + 1):
                if q[j] > 0:
                    eta.append(j)
            eta_ln = len(eta)
            rho = q[eta[0]]
            if eta_ln == 1:
                print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
            else:
                res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
                for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                    rho += q[eta[j]]
                print(res)
        else:
            print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the exponents of the lengths of sticks. The function calculates and prints the number of ways to choose three sticks such that the exponents of their lengths are the same or form a non-decreasing sequence. If `n` is less than 3, the function prints 0 for that test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variable `buffer` remains an empty list, while `t` (the number of test cases) is unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `w`.

2. **Frequency Count**:
   - The program initializes a frequency array `q` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It then iterates through the list `w` and increments the corresponding index in `q`.

3. **Non-zero Lengths**:
   - The program creates a list `eta` to store the unique stick lengths that have a non-zero count.
   - It also calculates the length of `eta` and stores it in `eta_ln`.

4. **Single Unique Length**:
   - If there is only one unique stick length (`eta_ln == 1`), the program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `n` sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), which is \( \frac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{6} \).

5. **Multiple Unique Lengths**:
   - If there are multiple unique stick lengths, the program initializes `rho` to the count of the first unique stick length.
   - It then iterates through the remaining unique stick lengths:
     - For each unique stick length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{q[eta[j]]}{3} \), which is \( \frac{q[eta[j]] \times (q[eta[j]] - 1) \times (q[eta[j]] - 2)}{6} \).
     - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from the current length and 1 stick from the previous lengths using the combination formula \( \binom{q[eta[j]]}{2} \times \rho \), which is \( \frac{q[eta[j]] \times (q[eta[j]] - 1)}{2} \times \rho \).
     - It updates `rho` to include the count of the current unique stick length.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Single Unique Length**:
  - If all sticks have the same length, any 3 sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. The formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `n` sticks.

- **Multiple Unique Lengths**:
  - For multiple unique lengths, the program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from the same length.
  - It also correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from one length and 1 stick from another length.
  - However, the program does not consider the case where the sum of the lengths of the two shorter sticks is not greater than the length of the longest stick, which is a requirement for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

### Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `7`, `1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Output: `35`
  - Reason: All sticks have the same length, so any 3 sticks can form a triangle. The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7 is \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \).

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `4`, `3 2 1 3`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: The unique lengths are 1, 2, and 3. The valid combinations are (1, 2, 3) and (3, 3, 2).

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `3`, `1 2 3`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: The lengths are 2, 4, and 8. No combination of these lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle because \( 2 + 4 \leq 8 \).

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `1`, `1`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: There are not enough sticks to form a triangle.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the single unique length case and the multiple unique length case, but it does not check the triangle inequality condition \( a + b > c \) for the lengths of the sticks. This is a critical error because a non-degenerate triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality.

### Correctness:
**False**
