To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the initial state for the loop to begin.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list**
