The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case. However, the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the exponents of the lengths of sticks. It returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters.**
