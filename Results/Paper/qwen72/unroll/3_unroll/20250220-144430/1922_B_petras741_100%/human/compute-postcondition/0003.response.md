Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks such that the exponents of their lengths are the same or form a non-decreasing sequence. The result for each test case is printed, and the variables `n`, `w`, `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, and `res` are updated and used within the loop for each test case. After all iterations, the variable `buffer` remains an empty list, and `t` is unchanged.**
