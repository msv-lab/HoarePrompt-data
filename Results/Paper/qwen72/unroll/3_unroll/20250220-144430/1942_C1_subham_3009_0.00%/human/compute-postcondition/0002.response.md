The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`func` is defined as `def max_triangles(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is 0, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The program is currently executing within the main module.**
