Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each test case, the output will be either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and the list `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The loop processes the input values and prints the result for each test case.**
