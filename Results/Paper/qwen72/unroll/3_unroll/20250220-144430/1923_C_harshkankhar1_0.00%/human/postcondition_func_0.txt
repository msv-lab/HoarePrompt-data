The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` and `q`, and a list `a` of integers. It then constructs a list `b` where each element is the cumulative sum of 1s and 2s based on whether the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1. After that, it prints the cumulative sums of the original list `a`. For each of the `q` queries, it reads a pair of integers `(x, y)` and prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in the subarray `a[x:y]` is greater than or equal to the sum of elements in the subarray `b[x:y]` and `x` is not equal to `y`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. The original input variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries` are not used or modified within the function.
