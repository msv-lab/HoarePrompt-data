Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem description:

1. **Function Call Issue**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will cause a `NameError` when the program is run.
2. **Output Issue**: The program prints the accumulated sums of the array `a` using `print(*a)`, which is not required by the problem description and will produce extra output.
3. **Logic Issue**: The logic for determining if a subarray is good is flawed. The program checks if the sum of the subarray `a[y] - a[x - 1]` is less than the sum of the subarray `b[y] - b[x - 1]` or if `x == y`. However, this does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically:
   - The condition `a_i \neq b_i` for every index `i` is not properly checked.
   - The condition `b_i > 0` for every index `i` is not properly checked.
   - The program does not ensure that the sum of the subarray `a` equals the sum of the subarray `b`.

A correct implementation would need to verify that for each subarray, there exists a corresponding array `b` that satisfies all the conditions. The current implementation does not do this correctly.

Example of incorrect behavior:
For the input:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```
The program will output:
```
0 1 3 4 8 13
NO
NO
NO
NO
```
Instead of the expected:
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```
The extra line `0 1 3 4 8 13` is not part of the required output, and the program incorrectly prints `NO` for all queries.
