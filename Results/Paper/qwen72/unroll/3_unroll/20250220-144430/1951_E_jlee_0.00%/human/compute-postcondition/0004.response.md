Functionality: ** The function `func` takes an integer `t` and processes `t` strings, each provided as input. For each string, it checks if the string can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the string are different, or if the string has a specific pattern where it can be split into two substrings that meet certain conditions. If the string meets these conditions, the function prints 'YES' followed by the number of substrings (1 or 2) and the substrings themselves. If the string does not meet these conditions, the function prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` strings, the function concludes without returning any value, and the values of `t` and the input strings remain unchanged. **
