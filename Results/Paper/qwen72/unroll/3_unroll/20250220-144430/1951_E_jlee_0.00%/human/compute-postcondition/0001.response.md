The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a list of strings where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6, and the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
