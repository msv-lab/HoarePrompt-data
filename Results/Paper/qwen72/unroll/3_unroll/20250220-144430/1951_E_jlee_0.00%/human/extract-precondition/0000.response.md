Precondition: **The function should take an integer t and a list of strings s as inputs, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and each string s consists of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6. The sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def func(t, s_list):
```

This would better reflect the input requirements described in the problem.
