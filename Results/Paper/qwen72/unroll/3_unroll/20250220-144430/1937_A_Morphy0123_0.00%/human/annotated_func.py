#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving an array `a` where `a_i = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, and the operation `swap(k)` is performed for each `2 ≤ k ≤ n`. The input to the function includes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function should return the position of the element 1 in the array after all the swap operations have been performed.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each test case, if `n` was 1, the output was 1. For other values of `n`, the output was the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. The variables `i` and `n` are no longer in scope, and `n_cases` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the position of the element 1 in an array after performing swap operations for each `2 ≤ k ≤ n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. For other values of `n`, it prints the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the variable `n_cases` remains unchanged.
