The function `func` accepts an integer `n` for each test case, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. The function is designed to return the position of the element 1 in an array `a` after performing a series of swap operations. The array `a` is initially defined such that `a_i = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, and the operation `swap(k)` is performed for each `2 ≤ k ≤ n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and returns the position of the element 1 in the array after performing swap operations for each `2 ≤ k ≤ n`.**
