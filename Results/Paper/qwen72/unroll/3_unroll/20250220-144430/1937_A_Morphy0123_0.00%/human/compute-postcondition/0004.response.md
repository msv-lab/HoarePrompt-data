Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the position of the element 1 in an array after performing swap operations for each `2 ≤ k ≤ n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. For other values of `n`, it prints the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the variable `n_cases` remains unchanged. **
