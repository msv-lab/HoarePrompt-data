Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` and `k` are such that it is impossible to set up the stalls to meet the requirements. Specifically, the program does not correctly determine when it is impossible to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
5 10
```
Here, Alice has 5 coins and Bob wants her to buy 10 jewels. This is impossible because Alice cannot buy 10 jewels with only 5 coins, even if each jewel costs 1 coin. However, the program will output:
```
YES
1
5
```
This output is incorrect because Alice cannot buy 10 jewels with only 5 coins, and the program should output "NO" in this case.
