The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, and an additional parameter `t` that represents the number of test cases. Each of `n` and `k` are positive integers with a range from 1 to 10^18, and `t` is an integer ranging from 1 to 1000.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each case. Since the specific output for each case is not detailed, we can only infer that the function likely returns a value or a set of values that are computed from `n` and `k` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). It processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
