Output State: **The initial state remains unchanged, but the `input` function now reads input from `sys.stdin`.** 

The code snippet reassigns the `input` function to read from `sys.stdin` using `sys.stdin.readline`. This change affects how input is read, but it does not alter the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, or the structure of the queries. Therefore, the initial state remains valid, with the only difference being the method used to read input.
