Output State: **The values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `e`, `num`, and `LA` remain unchanged. The loop iterates `N` times, and for each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `(l, r)` from the input, processes them according to the conditions in the loop, and prints a pair of integers or `(-1, -1)` based on those conditions. The list `arr` and the variable `N` are not modified by the loop.**

To break it down:
- `N` remains the same integer value as the input.
- `nums` remains the same list of integers read from `sys.stdin` with `-1` appended to it.
- `s` remains the index of the last element in `nums`.
- `e` remains 0.
- `num` remains the last element in `nums` (which is `-1`).
- `arr` remains the same list of tuples.
- `LA` remains the length of `arr` minus 1.
