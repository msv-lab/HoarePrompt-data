### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` and then iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` from the input.
     - It initializes `s` and `e` to 0 and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
     - It appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.

   - **Building the `arr` List:**
     - The function iterates over `nums` and builds a list `arr` of tuples. Each tuple `(s, e, num)` represents a segment in `nums` where all elements are the same.
     - The segment starts at index `s` and ends at index `e-1`, and the segment contains the integer `num`.

   - **Processing Queries:**
     - The function reads the number of queries and then iterates over each query.
     - For each query, it uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after the query's `l`.
     - It then extracts the segment start `s`, end `e`, and value `num` from `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`, where `LA` is the last valid index in `arr`.
     - The function checks several conditions to determine if a valid pair `(i, j)` exists within the query range `[l, r]`:
       - If `s > l`, it checks if `s == 1` or `s > r`. If either condition is true, it prints `(-1, -1)`. Otherwise, it prints `(s - 1, s)`.
       - If `e >= r`, it prints `(-1, -1)`.
       - If `e < N` or `e < l`, it prints `(s, e + 1)`.
       - Otherwise, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Segment Identification:**
     - The segment identification logic in the `for` loop is correct. It correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical elements and stores them in `arr`.
   - **Query Processing:**
     - The use of `bisect_left` to find the segment starting at or after `l` is correct.
     - The conditions to check if a valid pair `(i, j)` exists within the query range are mostly correct, but there is a potential issue:
       - The condition `if e >= r` is too strict. It should be `if e >= r and s == l`, because if the segment starts at `l` and ends at `r` or beyond, and there are no other segments, then there is no valid pair.
       - The condition `if e < N or e < l` is also incorrect. It should be `if e < r`, because if the segment ends before `r`, there might be another segment that can form a valid pair.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the entire array is a single segment of identical elements.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the query range is entirely within a single segment of identical elements.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical error in the query processing section, specifically in the conditions used to determine if a valid pair exists. The conditions `if e >= r` and `if e < N or e < l` are not correctly formulated to handle all edge cases.

### Correctness: **False**
