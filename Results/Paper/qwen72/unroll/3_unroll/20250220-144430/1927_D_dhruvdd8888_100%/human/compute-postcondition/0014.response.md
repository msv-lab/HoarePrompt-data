Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `nums` from the standard input. It processes `nums` to identify segments of consecutive identical integers and stores these segments in a list `arr`, where each segment is represented as a tuple `(start_index, end_index, value)`. The function then reads a series of queries, each consisting of a pair of integers `(l, r)`, and for each query, it prints a pair of integers representing the indices of the first and last occurrence of a value within the segment `[l, r]` of `nums`. If no such segment exists, it prints `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries. **
