Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of friends, followed by a list of integers `p` of length `n` representing the best friends of each friend. For each test case, the function prints either 2 or 3 to the standard output, indicating the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party. Specifically, it prints 2 if there is at least one pair of friends who are mutual best friends, and 3 otherwise. The function does not return any value. **
