Output State: **The loop will print either 2 or 3 for each test case, depending on whether there is a pair of friends who are best friends with each other. The variables `n`, `x`, `l`, and `flag` will be in their final states after the loop has executed, but their specific values will depend on the input. The variable `n` will remain unchanged, `x` will be the last input value for the number of friends in the current test case, `l` will be the last list of best friends for the current test case, and `flag` will be `True` if a pair of mutual best friends was found in the last test case, otherwise it will not be set or will remain `False`.**
