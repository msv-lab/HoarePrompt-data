Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Detecting Pairs**: The program checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` to determine if a pair of friends are each other's best friends. This condition is incorrect because it should check if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` to ensure that the best friend of `l[i]` is `i`.

2. **Handling of Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It should read the number of test cases `t` and then process each test case accordingly.

3. **Output for All Test Cases**: The program prints the result immediately after finding the first pair, which is incorrect. It should process all test cases and print the result for each one.

4. **Minimum Invitations Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of invitations needed. It simply prints `2` if it finds a pair and `3` otherwise, which is not always correct.

### Correct Solution:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the smallest set of friends such that at least 2 friends come to the party. This involves finding cycles or pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Create a set to track visited friends
        visited = set()
        
        # Function to find the size of the cycle starting from friend i
        def find_cycle_size(i):
            size = 0
            while i not in visited:
                visited.add(i)
                i = p[i - 1]
                size += 1
            return size
        
        # Find the smallest cycle size
        min_cycle_size = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i not in visited:
                cycle_size = find_cycle_size(i)
                min_cycle_size = min(min_cycle_size, cycle_size)
        
        # If the smallest cycle size is 2, Monocarp needs to send 2 invitations
        # Otherwise, he needs to send 3 invitations
        if min_cycle_size == 2:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(3)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Reading Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
2. **Cycle Detection**: It uses a set `visited` to keep track of friends who have been visited. The function `find_cycle_size` is used to find the size of the cycle starting from a given friend.
3. **Finding the Smallest Cycle**: The program iterates through all friends to find the smallest cycle size.
4. **Output**: If the smallest cycle size is 2, Monocarp needs to send 2 invitations. Otherwise, he needs to send 3 invitations.

This solution correctly handles the problem and ensures that the minimum number of invitations is calculated for each test case.
