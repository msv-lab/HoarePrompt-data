Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for finding the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i \ne a_j` within the given query range `[l, r]` is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

In the third query, the program should output `1 3` because `a_1 = 1` and `a_3 = 2`, which are different and within the range `[1, 3]`. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1 -1`.

The issue lies in the logic that determines the indices `i` and `j`. The program uses a binary search to find the first and last occurrences of a number in the array, but it does not correctly handle cases where the range `[l, r]` contains different numbers. The program should check for the presence of at least two different numbers within the range `[l, r]` and output their indices if they exist.
