### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
   - It appends a dummy value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It iterates through the array to create a list `arr` of tuples, where each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of a segment of the array where all elements are the same.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of queries and processes each query.
   - For each query, it uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the start index is just greater than or equal to `l`.
   - It then retrieves the segment information from `arr` using `min(eli, LA)`.
   - The program checks if the start index `s` of the segment is greater than `l`:
     - If `s` is greater than `l`, it prints the indices `s-1` and `s` if `s` is not 1.
     - If `s` is 1, it prints `-1 -1` because there is no valid pair.
   - If the end index `e` of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` because the segment does not contain any different elements.
   - If the end index `e` is less than `N`, it prints the indices `s` and `e+1`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program includes a debug print statement for a specific test case (`ppp == 23`), which is not a standard practice but does not affect the correctness of the solution.
   - The program also includes a conditional check `if tc > 5:` which skips processing for queries in test cases where `tc > 5`. This is incorrect as it means that for large test cases, the program does not process any queries, leading to incomplete or incorrect output.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes the input and creates the list `arr` of segments.
- The `bisect_left` function is used to find the appropriate segment for the query.
- The logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` is based on the segment boundaries and the query range, which is generally correct.
- However, the conditional check `if tc > 5:` followed by `continue` is a critical issue. This means that for test cases where `tc > 5`, the program will not process any queries and will not produce the required output.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the conditional skip for large test cases.
- The program is indeed incorrect due to this conditional skip, which violates the requirement to process all queries for all test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
