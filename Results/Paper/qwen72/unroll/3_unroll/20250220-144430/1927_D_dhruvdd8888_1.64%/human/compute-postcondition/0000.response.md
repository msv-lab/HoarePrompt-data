The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.readline` reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.readline`. This change affects how input is read from the standard input. The function `func_1` is expected to read input from stdin, and now it will use `sys.stdin.readline` instead of the default `input` function.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to read input from stdin and process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. The array `a` has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The number of queries `q` for each test case is an integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5). Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The total sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `input` is now `sys.stdin.readline`.**
