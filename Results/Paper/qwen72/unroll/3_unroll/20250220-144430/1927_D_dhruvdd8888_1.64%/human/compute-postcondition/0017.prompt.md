You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to read input from stdin and process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. The array `a` has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The number of queries `q` for each test case is an integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5). Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The total sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a range in the `nums` list and the value that was repeated in that range. `s` is the index of the last element in the `nums` list. `e` is 0. `num` is the last element in the `nums` list, which is `-1`.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: [nums list with the last element being -1 (the exact content of the list is not provided, but the last element is -1)]
    #State: *`arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a range in the `nums` list and the value that was repeated in that range. `s` is the index of the last element in the `nums` list. `e` is 0. `num` is the last element in the `nums` list, which is `-1`. `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1. If `ppp` is equal to 23, the postcondition remains unchanged.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: - After the loop finishes, `s` and `e` will be the values of the last tuple in `arr` that was processed.
    #   - `arr`, `LA`, `num`, and `ppp` will remain unchanged.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the loop code, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` reads from standard input and processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. The array `a` has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1,000,000). The number of queries `q` for each test case is an integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 200,000). Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The total sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000. The function returns the results of the queries for each test case.
