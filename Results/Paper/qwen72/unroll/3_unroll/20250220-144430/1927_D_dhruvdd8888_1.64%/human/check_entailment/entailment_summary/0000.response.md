Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by identifying contiguous ranges of repeated elements in the array and then using binary search to answer each query efficiently. However, there are a few issues and logical flaws in the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Global `ppp` Variable**: The variable `ppp` is used in the `func_1` function, but it is not defined within the function. It is defined in the outer loop, which means it will not have the correct value when `func_1` is called. This can lead to incorrect behavior or runtime errors.

2. **Appending `-1` to `nums`**: The program appends `-1` to the `nums` array to handle the end of the array. This is a common technique to avoid out-of-bounds errors, but it might not be necessary if the logic is handled correctly.

3. **Range Handling**: The logic for handling the ranges and queries is not entirely correct. Specifically, the conditions for determining whether a pair of indices exists within the query range `[l, r]` are flawed. The program should check if there are any different elements within the range `[l, r]` and not just rely on the boundaries of the ranges stored in `arr`.

4. **Binary Search Usage**: The binary search (`bisect_left`) is used to find the starting point of the range, but the subsequent logic to determine the indices is not robust. It should check if there are any different elements within the query range and not just the boundaries.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if all elements in the query range are the same, it should output `(-1, -1)`, but the current logic might not always do this correctly.

6. **Input Handling**: The input handling is not consistent. The function `func_1` redefines `input` as `sys.stdin.readline`, which can lead to confusion and potential issues if other parts of the code use `input` without redefining it.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands. It needs to be revised to properly handle the queries and edge cases.

Correctness: **False**
