Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - Within each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Array Processing**:
   - The program appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It then iterates through `nums` to create a list `arr` of tuples. Each tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` represents a range in `nums` where `num` is the value that was repeated from index `s` to `i-1`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the range starts.
   - It then checks the conditions to determine if there are two different elements in the range `(l, r)`:
     - If `s > l`, it means the range starts before the current segment, and it prints the indices `s - 1` and `s`.
     - If `e >= r`, it means the range ends within the current segment, and it prints `-1 -1` because there are no different elements.
     - If `e < N`, it prints the indices `s` and `e + 1` if they are within the range.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `l` and `r` are the same by ensuring `l < r` in the input constraints.
   - The appended `-1` to `nums` helps in handling the case where the last element of `nums` is different from the previous elements.

5. **Bisect Usage**:
   - The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate for finding the starting point of the range in `arr`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the indices or `-1 -1` based on the conditions.

However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

- **Global Variable `ppp`**:
  - The variable `ppp` is used in the function `func_1` but is defined outside the function. This is not a good practice and can lead to unexpected behavior. It should be passed as a parameter or removed if not necessary.

- **Condition `if tc > 5`**:
  - The condition `if tc > 5` is used to skip processing for test cases beyond the first 5. This is not part of the problem description and can lead to incorrect results for test cases beyond the first 5. This condition should be removed.

- **Condition `if s == 1`**:
  - The condition `if s == 1` is used to print `-1 -1` if the range starts at the beginning of the array. This is incorrect because it should check if the range `(l, r)` has no different elements, not just if `s == 1`.

- **Output State**:
  - The output state should be consistent with the problem description, ensuring that for each query, the correct indices or `-1 -1` are printed.

Given these issues, the program is not fully correct as it does not handle all test cases and has some logical errors.

Correctness: **False**
