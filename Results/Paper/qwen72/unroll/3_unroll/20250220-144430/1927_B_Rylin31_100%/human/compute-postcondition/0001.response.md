Output State: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each trace a, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z. The loop has processed t test cases, and for each test case, it has printed a string ans constructed from the array of integers. The variable s for each test case is a list of l integers, where each integer has been incremented by the number of times the corresponding index was accessed in the array.**
