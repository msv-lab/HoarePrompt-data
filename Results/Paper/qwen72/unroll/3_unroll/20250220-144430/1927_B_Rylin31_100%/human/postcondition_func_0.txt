The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` and a list of integers `array`. It then constructs a string `ans` by mapping each integer in `array` to a corresponding lowercase letter based on a counter `s`. The counter `s` is incremented each time an index is accessed. The function prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and `t` strings have been printed, each corresponding to a test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, and the internal state variables `s` and `ans` are reset for each test case.
