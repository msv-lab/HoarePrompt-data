Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns. The function `func_1` is used in a binary search, but the binary search is not necessary for this problem, and the function itself does not correctly calculate the profit.

The logic in `func_1` is:
```python
def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)
```
This function calculates the profit for a given `k` but returns `True` if the profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not the correct condition for determining the maximum profit.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to calculate the profit for each possible value of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)` and choose the maximum profit. The provided program does not do this and instead uses a binary search, which is not appropriate for this problem.

Here is a case where the program fails:
- Input: `1\n4 4 5`
- Expected Output: `17`
- Actual Output: `4`

The program incorrectly outputs `4` because the binary search logic is not correctly determining the maximum profit. The correct output should be `17` as explained in the problem description.
