Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), `a` and `b` are positive integers, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9, `ans` is `k * b`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `k * b` to its initial value of 0. Therefore, `ans` is now equal to `k * b`. The values and conditions of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged.
