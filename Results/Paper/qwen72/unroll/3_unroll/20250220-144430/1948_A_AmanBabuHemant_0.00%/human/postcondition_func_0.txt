The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the input. If `n` is odd or if the length of the string formed by repeating '110' `n // 2` times is 200 or more, the function prints "NO". If `n` is even and the length of the string is less than 200, the function prints "YES" followed by the string. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The state of `t` remains unchanged after the function execution.
