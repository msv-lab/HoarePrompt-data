The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `t` must be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
