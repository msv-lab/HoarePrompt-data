### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Vasya is in a line of students, and he remembers his position `n` and the number `x` he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - The pattern is: the first `k` positions are numbered `1` to `k`, the next `k - 2` positions are numbered `k - 1` to `2`, and this repeats.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `x`.
   - The output is the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints.

3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 \leq t \leq 100`
   - `1 \le x < n \le 10^9`
   - `k > 1`

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - For a given `n` and `x`, we need to find all `k` such that the number `x` appears at position `n` in the pattern.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` is used to find all divisors of `x`.
   - The main logic checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`: This checks if `n + x - 2` is even.
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`: This checks if `n - x` is even.
   - For each condition, it finds the divisors of the respective value and checks if they can form a valid `k` by ensuring `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.

6. **Function `func_1(x)`**:
   - This function finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in a list.
   - It iterates from `1` to `sqrt(x)` to find divisors and appends both `i` and `x / i` to the output lists.
   - The lists are then combined and returned.

7. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `output` to store valid `k` values.
   - It checks if `n + x - 2` is even and finds its divisors using `func_1`.
   - It checks if `n - x` is even and finds its divisors using `func_1`.
   - For each divisor, it checks if it can form a valid `k` and appends it to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list and prints the length of the list.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k = 1` is not valid.
   - It also correctly handles the constraints `1 \le x < n \le 10^9`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` and checks if they can form valid `k` values.
- The logic for checking the divisors and ensuring they form valid `k` values is correct.
- The program handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
