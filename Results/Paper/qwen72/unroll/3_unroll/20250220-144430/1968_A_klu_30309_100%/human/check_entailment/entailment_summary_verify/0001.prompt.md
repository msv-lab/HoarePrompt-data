You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases` where each integer `x` in `test_cases` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000. For each integer `x` in `test_cases`, it computes the largest integer `y` (1 <= y < x) such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` is maximized. The function returns a list of these integers `y` for each `x` in `test_cases`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and the returned list `results` contains the computed values for each `x` in `test_cases`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - For each test case, we need to output any such \( y \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then reads \( t \) integers \( x \).
   - It calls the function `func_1` with \( t \) and the list of test cases.
   - The function `func_1` iterates over each test case \( x \) and finds the best \( y \) by iterating from \( x-1 \) down to 1.
   - For each \( y \), it calculates \( \gcd(x, y) \) and the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - If the current sum is greater than the maximum sum found so far, it updates the maximum sum and the best \( y \).
   - The program then appends the best \( y \) to the results list and returns it.

3. **Logical Flow**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes the maximum sum and the best \( y \).
   - It iterates over all possible \( y \) values from \( x-1 \) to 1.
   - It correctly calculates the \( \gcd \) and the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - It updates the best \( y \) if the current sum is greater than the maximum sum found so far.

4. **Optimization and Early Termination**:
   - The program includes a `break` statement after finding the first \( y \) that maximizes the sum. This is incorrect because it may not find the actual maximum sum. The `break` should be removed to ensure the program checks all possible \( y \) values.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program would be correct if the `break` statement is removed, as it would then correctly find the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for each \( x \).

Given the current implementation with the `break` statement, the program will not always find the correct \( y \) that maximizes the sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
