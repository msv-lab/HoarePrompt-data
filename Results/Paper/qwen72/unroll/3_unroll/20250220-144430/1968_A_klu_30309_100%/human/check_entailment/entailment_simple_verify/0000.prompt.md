You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers 'results', where each integer is the largest y (1 <= y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximized for each x in the list 'test_cases'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \(1 \le y < x\). The issue lies in the `break` statement within the loop. This causes the loop to terminate as soon as it finds the first `y` that satisfies the condition, rather than continuing to check all possible values of `y` to ensure the maximum sum is found. For example, for \(x = 10\), the program will output `5` (since \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\)), but the correct answer should be `6` (since \(\gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8\)). This means the program does not always find the optimal `y` for every `x`.
