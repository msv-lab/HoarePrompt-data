The only objects in the loop head are the variable `itm` and the list `mex`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `mex`. If `mex` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is the same input integer, `arr` is the same list of integers, `mex` is a list of integers representing the appended values based on the conditions in the loop, `minn` is the final value of `minn` after all iterations, and `maxx` is the final value of `maxx` after all iterations. However, for the loop to execute, `mex` must have at least one element, and `itm` will be the first element of `mex`.

State: **`n` is the same input integer, `arr` is the same list of integers, `mex` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `itm` is the first element of `mex`, `minn` is the final value of `minn` after all iterations, `maxx` is the final value of `maxx` after all iterations**
