Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers.**

The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer. The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`. Therefore, after executing this code, `arr` becomes a list of integers, while `n` remains an input integer.
