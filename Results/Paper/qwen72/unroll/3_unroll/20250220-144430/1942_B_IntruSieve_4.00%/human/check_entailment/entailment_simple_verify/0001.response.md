### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1` such that for each `i`, `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes `mex` to store the constructed permutation, `minn` to track the smallest unused non-negative integer, and `maxx` to track the maximum value used in the permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates through each element `arr[i]` of the array `a`.
   - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This is because if `a_i` is positive, it means `p_i` is the smallest unused non-negative integer, which is `minn`.
   - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is because if `a_i` is negative, it means `p_i` is a value that is not the smallest unused non-negative integer, but rather a value that makes `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` equal to `arr[i]`.
   - It also updates `maxx` to ensure that the maximum value used in the permutation is correctly tracked.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation, the program prints the elements of `mex` for each test case.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the permutation based on the given `a` array.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for updating `minn` and `maxx`:
     - When `arr[i] > 0`, the program correctly appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
     - When `arr[i] <= 0`, the program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`, but this value might not be the correct value for `p_i`. The MEX calculation and the value of `p_i` should ensure that the MEX of the prefix of `p` up to `i` minus `p_i` equals `arr[i]`.
     - The update `if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx: maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)` is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is a valid permutation element. It should instead ensure that the value `p_i` is within the range `[0, n-1]` and not already used in the permutation.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The program's logic for handling positive `arr[i]` is correct.
   - The logic for handling negative `arr[i]` is flawed and does not ensure that the constructed permutation `p` is valid.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling negative `arr[i]` values. The update to `mex` and the tracking of `maxx` need to be revised to ensure that the constructed permutation `p` is valid and satisfies the given conditions.

Final: **False**
