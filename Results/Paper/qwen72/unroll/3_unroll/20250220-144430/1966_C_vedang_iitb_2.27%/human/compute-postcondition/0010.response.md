Postcondition: **`a` is a list of positive integers with length `len(a) - 1`, `n` is `n - 1`, `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= `len(a) - 1`. Additionally, `winNext` is either 2 or 1, and if `winNext` is 1, then the first element of `a` is not 1.**
