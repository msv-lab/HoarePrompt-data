### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a list `a` and returns a new list `a_new` where each element is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted unique list of `a`.
   - The purpose of this function is not clear in the context of the problem. The game logic does not require transforming the list of pile sizes in this manner.
   - Therefore, `func_1` is not used in the solution and does not contribute to solving the problem.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to determine the winner of the game.
   - The function works as follows:
     - If `n` (the number of piles) is 1, it returns 1 (indicating Alice wins).
     - If `n` is 2, it returns 1 if the first element of `a` is even, otherwise it returns 2 (indicating Bob wins).
     - For `n` greater than 2, it recursively calls itself with the list `a` excluding the first element and `n` decremented by 1.
     - If the result of the recursive call is 2, or if the result is 1 and the first element of `a` is not 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 2.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game involves selecting a positive integer `k` that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile and removing `k` stones from each nonempty pile.
   - The optimal strategy is to always choose the largest possible `k` that can be removed from all nonempty piles, which effectively reduces the problem to a smaller subproblem.
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly implement this optimal strategy. It only considers the first element of the list and the rest of the list recursively, which is insufficient to determine the winner for all cases.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the test case `a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` and `n = 5`.
   - According to the problem description, Alice can win by choosing `k=3` on her first turn, which will empty all the piles at once.
   - However, the function `func_2` will not correctly handle this scenario. It will recursively call itself with the list `[3, 3, 3, 3]` and `n = 4`, and so on, without considering the optimal move of choosing `k=3`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the game logic as described.
   - The function `func_1` is not used and does not contribute to the solution.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
