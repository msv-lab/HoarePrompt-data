The function `func` reads an integer `tt` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers `a` within the range [1, n]. The function calculates a value `ans` based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a` and the value of `y`. It then prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `tt`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is sorted.
