Output State: **The value of `x` is not preserved and changes with each iteration based on user input. The list `s` will contain a sequence of characters representing the modified binary form of `x` after the transformations. The variable `length` will be the length of the modified list `s`, which could be 30 or 31 depending on the transformations applied. The variable `flag` will be 0 or 1 based on the final state of the transformations.**
