### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find a position `i` to place a road such that:
     - At least half of the residents on the left side of the road (from house 1 to house `i`) want to live on the left side.
     - At least half of the residents on the right side of the road (from house `i+1` to house `n`) want to live on the right side.
   - The road should be placed as close to the middle of the village as possible, minimizing `|n/2 - i|`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Input**: The function reads `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from the user.
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: It calculates the prefix sums of '0's and '1's in the string `a` and stores them in the list `S`. `S[i]` contains the number of '0's and '1's up to the `i-1`-th house.
   - **Condition Checking**: It iterates over all possible positions `i` (from 0 to `n` inclusive) to place the road. For each position, it checks:
     - The number of '0's on the left side (`left`) is at least half of the left side length (`lsum`).
     - The number of '1's on the right side (`right`) is at least half of the right side length (`rsum`).
   - **Optimal Position Selection**: If the conditions are met, it updates the answer `ans` to the position `i` that minimizes `|n/2 - i|`.
   - **Output**: It prints the optimal position `i` (0-indexed).

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Input**: The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases.
   - **Test Case Handling**: It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Output**: The output for each test case is handled by `func_1`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum list `S` is correctly calculated and used to determine the number of '0's and '1's on both sides of the road for any position `i`.
   - **Condition Checking**: The conditions for the number of '0's and '1's on each side are correctly checked using the prefix sums.
   - **Optimal Position Selection**: The function correctly updates the answer to the position that minimizes `|n/2 - i|` while satisfying the conditions.
   - **Test Case Handling**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets all the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the prefix sums, checks the conditions for each possible road position, and selects the optimal position that minimizes the distance from the middle of the village.

Correctness: **True**
