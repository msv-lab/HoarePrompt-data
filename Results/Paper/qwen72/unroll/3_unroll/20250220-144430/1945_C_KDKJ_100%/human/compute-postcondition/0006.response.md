The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n + 1` must be at least 1, which means `n` must be 0 or greater. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, and `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists. The state of `S` and `ans` do not affect the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`S` is a list containing `n+1` sublists, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
