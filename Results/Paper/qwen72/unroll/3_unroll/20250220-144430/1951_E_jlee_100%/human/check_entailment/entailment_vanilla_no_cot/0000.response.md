Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from correctly handling all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies that a single character string is a palindrome and prints "NO". This is correct.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Strings with All Characters the Same**: The program correctly identifies that a string with all characters the same (like "lllllllll") cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO". This is correct.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Strings with One Different Character**: The program attempts to handle strings where all but one character are the same, but it has a logical error. For example, for the string "abaaaaa", the program should print "YES" and a valid partition, but it incorrectly prints "NO" because it does not correctly handle the case where the different character is in the middle of the string.

4. **Incorrect Handling of General Cases**: The program does not correctly handle general cases where the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, for the string "uwuowouwu", the program should print "YES" and a valid partition, but it does not. The logic for finding a valid partition is overly complex and does not cover all possible valid partitions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        if n == 2:
            if string[0] != string[1]:
                print('YES')
                print(1)
                print(string)
            else:
                print('NO')
            continue
        
        if not is_palindrome(string):
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            continue
        
        # Try to partition the string into two non-palindromic substrings
        for i in range(1, n):
            if not is_palindrome(string[:i]) and not is_palindrome(string[i:]):
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:i], string[i:])
                break
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Check for Single Character Strings**: If the string length is 1, it is a palindrome, so print "NO".
2. **Check for Two Character Strings**: If the string length is 2, check if the characters are different. If they are, print "YES" and the string itself. If they are the same, print "NO".
3. **Check if the Entire String is a Palindrome**: If the entire string is not a palindrome, print "YES" and the string itself as a single partition.
4. **Partition into Two Substrings**: If the entire string is a palindrome, try to partition it into two non-palindromic substrings. If such a partition is found, print "YES" and the partition. If no such partition is found, print "NO".

This corrected program should handle all cases correctly as per the problem description.
