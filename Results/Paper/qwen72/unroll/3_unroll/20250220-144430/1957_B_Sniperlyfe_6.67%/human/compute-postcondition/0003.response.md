Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `nums` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, except the last element which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`; `k` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums[-1]` (the last element in the list `nums`) is incremented by the current value of `k`.
- The initial value of each element in `nums` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- After the increment, the last element in `nums` becomes `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.
- The value of `k` is reduced by the sum of all elements in `nums`, and since the sum of all elements in `nums` is exactly `k`, `k` becomes 0.
