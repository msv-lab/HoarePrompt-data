The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(n)`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9
- `nums` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0

We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. This means `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be set to 0 by the `range(n)` function at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0**
