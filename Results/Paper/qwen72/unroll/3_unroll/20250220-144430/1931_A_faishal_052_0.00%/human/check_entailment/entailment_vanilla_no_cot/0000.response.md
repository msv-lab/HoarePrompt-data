Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded. Here are the issues:

1. **Logic for Determining the Smallest Lexicographical Word**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the distribution of the remaining value of `lex` among the three letters. It should ensure that the smallest possible values are assigned to the letters while maintaining the sum.
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the sum of the positions is less than or equal to 26 for the first two letters, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Handling the Remaining Value**:
   - The program appends the remaining value of `lex` to the array without ensuring that the values are distributed correctly to form the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array `arr` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results because it does not preserve the order of the letters in the word.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the array to store the positions of the letters
        arr = [0, 0, 0]
        
        # Distribute the value of lex to the three letters
        for i in range(3):
            if lex > 26:
                arr[i] = 26
                lex -= 26
            else:
                arr[i] = lex
                lex = 0
        
        # Ensure the word is lexicographically smallest
        for i in range(2, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] > 1 and arr[i-1] < 26:
                arr[i] -= 1
                arr[i-1] += 1
        
        # Print the word
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the values are distributed correctly to form the lexicographically smallest word. It also handles the edge cases where the sum of the positions is less than or equal to 26 for the first two letters.
