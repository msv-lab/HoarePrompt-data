### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases` and then processes each test case by reading an integer `lex` which represents the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters.

2. **Algorithm:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then iterates twice to determine the positions of the first two letters:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted in ascending order to ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
   - Finally, it prints the corresponding letters by converting the positions to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle the minimum and maximum values of `lex` (3 and 78) correctly.
   - For `lex = 3`, the smallest word is "aaa" because the sum of positions 1 + 1 + 1 is 3.
   - For `lex = 78`, the smallest word is "zzz" because the sum of positions 26 + 26 + 26 is 78.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm ensures that the letters are chosen in such a way that the sum of their positions equals `lex`.
   - By sorting the positions, it guarantees that the word is lexicographically smallest.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle cases where `lex` is exactly 52 correctly. For example, if `lex = 52`, the program will append 26 twice and then 0, which is incorrect because the position of a letter cannot be 0.
   - The program should ensure that the positions of the letters are always between 1 and 26.

### Correctness:
Given the potential issue with handling `lex = 52` and other edge cases where the positions might not be correctly calculated, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness: **False**
