Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Finding Maximum Index (`maxi`)**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases and the size of the permutation `n` for each test case.
   - It initializes `maxi` to 0 and iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it queries the comparison of `(p_maxi | p_maxi)` and `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `maxi` to `i`. This step ensures that `maxi` is the index of the element with the highest value in the permutation, as `p_i | p_i` will be equal to `p_i`.

2. **Finding Indices with Maximum XOR**:
   - The function initializes `arr` with the index 0.
   - It then iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` again, querying the comparison of `(p_maxi | p_arr[0])` and `(p_maxi | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `arr` to contain only `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `arr`. This step ensures that `arr` contains all indices `i` such that `p_i ⊕ p_maxi` is equal to the maximum XOR value found so far.

3. **Finding Minimum Index (`mini`)**:
   - The function initializes `mini` to the first index in `arr`.
   - It iterates through the remaining indices in `arr`, querying the comparison of `(p_mini | p_mini)` and `(p_item | p_item)`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mini` to `item`. This step ensures that `mini` is the index of the element with the lowest value among the indices in `arr`.

4. **Outputting the Result**:
   - Finally, the function outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini` such that `p_maxi ⊕ p_mini` is maximized.

**Key Points**:
- The function correctly identifies the index `maxi` of the maximum element in the permutation.
- It then identifies all indices `i` such that `p_i ⊕ p_maxi` is maximized.
- Among these indices, it selects the index `mini` of the minimum element, ensuring that `p_maxi ⊕ p_mini` is indeed maximized.

**Queries and Constraints**:
- The function makes at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.
- Each query is correctly formatted and flushed, ensuring the interactor can process it.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
