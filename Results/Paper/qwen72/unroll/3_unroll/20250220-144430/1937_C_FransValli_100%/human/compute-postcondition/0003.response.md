Functionality: ** The function operates in an interactive environment and processes a series of permutations of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. For each permutation, it makes at most 3n queries involving four indices each. The function identifies and outputs two indices `maxi` and `mini` such that the XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation `p` is maximized. The list `arr` will contain all indices `i` such that `p_i ⊕ p_maxi` is equal to the maximum XOR value found during the loop execution. **
