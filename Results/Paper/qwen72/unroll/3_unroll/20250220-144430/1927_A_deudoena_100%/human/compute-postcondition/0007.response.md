To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in s[::-1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over the reversed string `s[::-1]`. For the loop to execute, the string `s` must have at least one character. The variable `j` will take on the value of each character in the reversed string `s`.

Let's break down the state adjustments:

1. **`s`**: The string `s` must have at least one character for the loop to execute. If `s` is empty, the loop will not run.
2. **`j`**: This variable will be initialized by the loop to the last character of `s` (the first character in the reversed string).

The other variables (`c`, `d`, `ma`, `mi`, `m`, `t`, `l`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`s` must have at least one character, `j` is the last character of `s`**
