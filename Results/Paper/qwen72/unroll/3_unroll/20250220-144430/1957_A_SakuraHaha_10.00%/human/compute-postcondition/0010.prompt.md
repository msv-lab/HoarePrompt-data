You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of integers n, and a list of lists a, where t is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), each n[i] is the number of sticks for the i-th test case (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 100), and each a[i] is a list of stick lengths for the i-th test case, with each stick length a[i][j] being an integer (1 ≤ a[i][j] ≤ 100).
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `t` remains the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` remains the input integer, `a` remains the list of integers where each element a[j] is an integer (1 ≤ a[j] ≤ 100), `ans` remains 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `t` remains the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` remains the input integer, `a` remains the list of integers where each element a[j] is an integer (1 ≤ a[j] ≤ 100), `ans` is the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt` by 4, `cnt` remains a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of the floor division of each count in `cnt` by 4.
    #   - Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (a list of integers representing the number of sticks for each test case), and `a` (a list of lists containing the lengths of the sticks for each test case). It returns a list of results, where each result is "Yes" if it is possible to form a square using any four of the sticks for the corresponding test case, and "No" otherwise.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
