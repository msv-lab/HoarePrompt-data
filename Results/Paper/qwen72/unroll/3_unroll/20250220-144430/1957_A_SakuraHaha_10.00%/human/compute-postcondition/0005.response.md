Output State: **`t` remains the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` remains the input integer, `a` remains the list of integers where each element a[j] is an integer (1 ≤ a[j] ≤ 100), `ans` remains 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.**
