Reasoning:  
The provided function `func` attempts to solve the problem by printing a specific set of coordinates for each test case. However, the solution is not correct for all values of `n`. The function prints the coordinates '1 1' and '1 2' for every test case, which is a good start for small `n` values, but it fails to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for larger `n` values.

For `n = 2` and `n = 3`, the function's output is correct:
- For `n = 2`, the coordinates are (1, 1) and (1, 2), which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\) with a size of 2.
- For `n = 3`, the coordinates are (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3), which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) with a size of 4.

However, for `n > 3`, the function prints '1 1', '1 2', '2 4', and then a sequence of coordinates from '4 4' to 'n n'. This approach does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) because it does not consider the full range of possible distances. For example, for `n = 4`, the function prints:
- (1, 1)
- (1, 2)
- (2, 4)
- (4, 4)

This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 3, 6\}\) with a size of 4, which is not the maximum possible size. The maximum size for `n = 4` should be 6, as shown in the example where the coordinates are (1, 1), (1, 3), (4, 3), and (4, 4), which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) with a size of 7.

Therefore, the function does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of `n`.

Correctness: **False**
