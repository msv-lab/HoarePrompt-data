t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and for the given trace a, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
