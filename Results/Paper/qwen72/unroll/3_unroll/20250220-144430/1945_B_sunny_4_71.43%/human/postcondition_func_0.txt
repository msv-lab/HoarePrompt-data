The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases, with 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, where 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. It then computes two values, `A` and `B`, as `int(m / a) + 1` and `int(m / b) + 1` respectively, and prints the sum `A + B`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function does not return any value, but the sum `A + B` for each test case is printed to the output. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are not modified by the function.
