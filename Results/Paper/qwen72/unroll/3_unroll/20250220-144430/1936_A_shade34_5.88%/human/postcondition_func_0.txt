The function operates in an interactive environment to process multiple test cases, each involving a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4. For each test case, the function queries the environment to find and output two indices `mak2` and `mak` such that the bitwise XOR of `p[mak2]` and `p[mak]` is maximized. The function ensures that it makes at most 3n queries for each permutation. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the interactive environment is left in a state where the indices for each permutation have been outputted.
