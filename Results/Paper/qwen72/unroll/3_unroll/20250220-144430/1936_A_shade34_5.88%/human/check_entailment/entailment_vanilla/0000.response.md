### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form \("? a b c d\").
   - Each query returns a comparison result between \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding an index \(mak\) that maximizes \(p_{mak} \mid p_{mak}\).
   - This is done by comparing \(p_0 \mid p_0\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - If \(p_i \mid p_i\) is greater, \(mak\) is updated to \(i\).

3. **Finding the Second Maximum:**
   - The program then tries to find another index \(mak2\) that, when combined with \(mak\), maximizes \(p_{mak} \oplus p_{mak2}\).
   - It does this by comparing \(p_{mak} \mid p_{mak2}\) with \(p_i \mid p_{mak2}\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - If \(p_i \mid p_{mak2}\) is greater, \(mak\) is updated to \(i\) and \(pans\) is reset to \([i]\).
   - If \(p_i \mid p_{mak2}\) is equal, \(i\) is added to \(pans\).

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - The program then compares the elements in \(pans\) to find the one that maximizes \(p_{pans[mak]} \oplus p_{pans[i]}\).
   - It updates \(mak\) to the index that gives the maximum result.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program outputs the indices \(mak2\) and \(mak\) as the answer.

### Analysis:

- **Query Count:**
  - The first loop runs \(n-1\) times.
  - The second loop runs \(n\) times.
  - The third loop runs at most \(n\) times (but typically less, as \(pans\) is a subset of indices).
  - The total number of queries is \(2n - 1 + \text{length of } pans\), which is at most \(3n\) queries.

- **Logic:**
  - The program correctly identifies the index \(mak\) that maximizes \(p_{mak} \mid p_{mak}\).
  - The second loop correctly identifies a subset of indices that are equal to \(mak\) in terms of the OR operation.
  - The third loop correctly identifies the maximum XOR value within the subset of indices.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly solve the problem within the given constraints. It uses the allowed number of queries and follows the correct logic to find the indices that maximize the XOR value.

### Correctness:
**True**
