### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form \("? a b c d\").
   - Each query returns a comparison result between \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding an index \(mak\) that maximizes \(p_{mak} \mid p_{mak}\).
   - This is done by comparing \(p_0 \mid p_0\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - If \(p_i \mid p_i\) is greater, \(mak\) is updated to \(i\).

3. **Finding the Second Maximum:**
   - The program then tries to find another index \(mak2\) that, when combined with \(mak\), maximizes \(p_{mak} \oplus p_{mak2}\).
   - It does this by comparing \(p_{mak} \mid p_{mak2}\) with \(p_i \mid p_{mak2}\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - If \(p_i \mid p_{mak2}\) is greater, \(mak\) is updated to \(i\) and \(pans\) is reset to \([i]\).
   - If \(p_i \mid p_{mak2}\) is equal, \(i\) is added to \(pans\).

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - The program then compares the elements in \(pans\) to find the one that maximizes \(p_{pans[mak]} \oplus p_{pans[i]}\).
   - It updates \(mak\) to the index that gives the maximum result.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program outputs the indices \(mak2\) and \(mak\) as the answer.

### Analysis:

- **Query Count:**
  - The first loop runs \(n-1\) times.
  - The second loop runs \(n\) times.
  - The third loop runs at most \(n\) times (but typically less, as \(pans\) is a subset of indices).
  - The total number of queries is \(2n - 1 + \text{length of } pans\), which is at most \(3n\) queries.

- **Logic:**
  - The program correctly identifies the index \(mak\) that maximizes \(p_{mak} \mid p_{mak}\).
  - The second loop correctly identifies a subset of indices that are equal to \(mak\) in terms of the OR operation.
  - The third loop correctly identifies the maximum XOR value within the subset of indices.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **First Loop:**
  - The loop iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) and updates \(mak\) to the index \(i\) if \(p_i \mid p_i\) is greater than \(p_{mak} \mid p_{mak}\).
  - This ensures that \(mak\) is the index of the maximum value of \(p_i \mid p_i\).
  - The number of queries is \(n-1\).

- **Second Loop:**
  - The loop iterates from 0 to \(n-1\) and updates \(mak\) to the index \(i\) if \(p_i \mid p_{mak2}\) is greater than \(p_{mak} \mid p_{mak2}\).
  - If \(p_i \mid p_{mak2}\) is equal to \(p_{mak} \mid p_{mak2}\), \(i\) is added to \(pans\).
  - This ensures that \(pans\) contains all indices that are equal to \(mak\) in terms of the OR operation with \(mak2\).
  - The number of queries is \(n\).

- **Third Loop:**
  - The loop iterates over the indices in \(pans\) and updates \(mak\) to the index \(i\) if \(p_{pans[i]} \oplus p_{pans[mak]}\) is greater.
  - This ensures that \(mak\) is the index that maximizes the XOR value within the subset of indices.
  - The number of queries is at most \(n\) (but typically less, as \(pans\) is a subset of indices).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly identifies the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized within the given constraints. It uses the allowed number of queries and follows the correct logic to find the indices that maximize the XOR value.
