Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, `res` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (l, r), `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + 1]` does not match its index 0.**
