Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (l, r), `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` does not match its index from 0 to `i`, and `i` is greater than 0. Additionally, the current value of `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`.**
