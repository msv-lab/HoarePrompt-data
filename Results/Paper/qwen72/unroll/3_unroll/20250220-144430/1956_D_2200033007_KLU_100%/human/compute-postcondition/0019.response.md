Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` (if `i` is unchanged) or 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` + 1 (if `i` is decremented), `res` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (l, r). If `arr[start_index + i] == i`, then `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` does not match its index from 0 to `i-1`, and `i` is greater than or equal to 0. If `arr[start_index + i] != i`, then `i` is now `i - 1`, all elements from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` (inclusive) are set to `i - 1`, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)`, and `is_already_stairs` is False, with `i` being greater than 0.***
