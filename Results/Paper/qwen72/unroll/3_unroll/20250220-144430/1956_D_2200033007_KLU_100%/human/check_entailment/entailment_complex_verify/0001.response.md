### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the array by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - We need to ensure that the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \cdot 10^5\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function is intended to calculate the maximum possible sum of the subarray `a[start_index:end_index]` after performing the allowed operations.
   - It uses memoization to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index == end_index`, where the MEX is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `arr[start_index]`.
   - For subarrays of length greater than 1, it considers different ways to split the subarray and calculates the maximum sum by including the MEX of the subarray in the sum.
   - However, the function does not correctly compute the MEX value. It uses a heuristic that is not aligned with the problem's definition of MEX. Specifically, it uses the square of the subarray length as a heuristic, which is incorrect.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It first calls `func_1` to get the maximum value for the subarray.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the appropriate operation.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - The logic here is flawed because the maximum value being equal to the square of the subarray length does not necessarily mean that the subarray is in the correct form to achieve the maximum sum. This heuristic is incorrect.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs(i)`**:
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired form (a sequence of integers from 0 to `i`).
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and updates the array and the result list `res` with the operations performed.
   - The function's logic is also flawed because it does not correctly identify the MEX value and does not ensure that the subarray is transformed into the correct form to achieve the maximum sum.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program uses a combination of dynamic programming and recursive backtracking to find the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.
   - However, the heuristics used in `func_1` and `func_2` are incorrect, leading to potentially incorrect results.
   - The `make_stairs` function does not correctly handle the transformation of subarrays to achieve the maximum sum.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the subarray length is 1, but the logic for longer subarrays is flawed.
   - It does not correctly handle the transformation of subarrays to achieve the maximum sum.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The dynamic programming approach is intended to avoid redundant calculations, but the incorrect heuristics mean that the program may not achieve the correct results.
   - The recursive backtracking ensures that the sequence of operations is constructed, but the sequence may not be correct due to the flawed heuristics.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the array after performing the allowed operations.
- The sequence of operations is not correctly constructed to achieve the maximum sum.
- The heuristics used in the program are incorrect and do not align with the problem's definition of MEX.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
