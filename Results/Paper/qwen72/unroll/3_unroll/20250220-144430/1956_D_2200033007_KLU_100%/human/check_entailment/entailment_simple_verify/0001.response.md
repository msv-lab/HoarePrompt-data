### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The operations are limited to \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function is intended to calculate the maximum possible sum of the subarray `a[start_index:end_index]` after performing the allowed operations.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index == end_index`, where the MEX is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `arr[start_index]`.
   - For subarrays of length greater than 1, it considers different ways to split the subarray and calculates the maximum sum by including the MEX of the subarray in the sum.
   - However, the logic for calculating the MEX and the maximum sum is flawed. The function does not correctly compute the MEX value of the subarray, and the recursive calls do not accurately reflect the MEX operation.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function is intended to construct the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It first calls `func_1` to get the maximum value for the subarray.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the appropriate operation.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - Otherwise, it recursively checks different splits of the subarray to find the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum.
   - The logic for constructing the operations is also flawed. The function does not correctly handle the MEX transformation and may return incorrect operations.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs(i)`**:
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired form (a sequence of integers from 0 to `i`).
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and updates the array and the result list `res` with the operations performed.
   - The function has a logical error in the way it updates the subarray and the result list. It does not correctly handle the MEX transformation and may produce incorrect results.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program's overall logic is flawed due to incorrect MEX calculation and transformation.
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is not correctly implemented to reflect the MEX operation.
   - The recursive backtracking in `func_2` and the transformation in `make_stairs` are not correctly handling the MEX transformation, leading to incorrect results.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does handle the case where the subarray length is 1.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the transformation of subarrays into MEX values, especially for subarrays of length greater than 1.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The dynamic programming approach is intended to reduce redundant calculations, but the incorrect MEX calculation and transformation logic make the program inefficient and incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly implement the MEX operation and transformation logic. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` contain logical errors that prevent the program from achieving the correct maximum sum and constructing the correct sequence of operations.

**Final: False**
