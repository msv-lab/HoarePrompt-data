### Reasoning

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues and validate the original assessment using the annotated code:

1. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The problem requires calculating the MEX of a subarray, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The function `func_1` does not calculate the MEX. Instead, it seems to be trying to maximize a different value, which is not related to the MEX operation.
   - The function `func_1` calculates a value based on the squared length of the subarray and the sum of elements, which is not the correct approach for finding the MEX.

2. **Sum Maximization**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements after performing the MEX operation.
   - The function `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to maximize a value that is not the sum of the array elements. They are trying to maximize a value that is the sum of squared lengths of subarrays and the sum of elements, which is not the correct approach.
   - The function `func_1` returns a value that is not the maximum sum of the array elements after performing the MEX operation.

3. **Transformation**:
   - The function `make_stairs` is intended to transform the array to achieve the maximum sum, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation.
   - The function `make_stairs` attempts to set elements of the array to a specific value, but it does not ensure that the MEX operation is applied correctly.
   - The function `make_stairs` is recursive and does not handle the transformation in a way that aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Example of Incorrectness

Consider the input:
```
4
0 1 2 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
10 1
1 4
```

However, the program will not produce this output. Here's why:

- **func_1**:
  - For the subarray `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, the MEX is 4.
  - The function `func_1` does not calculate the MEX and instead uses a different logic that does not align with the problem's requirements.
  - The function `func_1` returns a value that is not the maximum sum of the array elements after performing the MEX operation.

- **func_2**:
  - The function `func_2` calls `func_1` to get the maximum value, but since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.
  - The function `func_2` does not correctly determine the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

- **make_stairs**:
  - The function `make_stairs` is called to transform the array, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation.
  - The function `make_stairs` sets elements of the array to a specific value, but it does not ensure that the MEX operation is applied correctly.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` are not designed to calculate the MEX, maximize the sum of the array elements, or correctly transform the array based on the MEX operation.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
