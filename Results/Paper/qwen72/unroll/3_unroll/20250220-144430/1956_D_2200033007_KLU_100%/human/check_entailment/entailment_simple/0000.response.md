Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the sum of the elements in an array by performing a series of operations that replace a subarray with the MEX of that subarray. The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem, with `func_1` computing the maximum possible sum for a given subarray and `func_2` constructing the sequence of operations to achieve this sum. The `make_stairs` function is used to perform the actual operations on the array.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Base Case**: If `start_index` is equal to `end_index`, the function returns the maximum of 1 and the value at `arr[start_index]`. This is correct because the MEX of a single-element set is either 1 (if the element is 0) or the element itself (if it is greater than 0).
- **Recursive Case**: The function tries to split the array at different points and compute the maximum sum by considering the MEX of the subarrays. However, there is a logical issue in the loop where it iterates from `start_index + 1` to `end_index - 1` and calculates `new_res` as `func_1(start_index, i - 1) + func_1(i + 1, end_index) + arr[i]`. This does not correctly account for the MEX operation, which should replace the entire subarray from `l` to `r` with the MEX value.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Base Case**: If the length of the subarray is 1, the function returns an empty list if the element is positive, or a list containing a single operation if the element is 0. This is correct.
- **Recursive Case**: The function attempts to find the optimal split point that achieves the maximum value computed by `func_1`. However, the logic for checking if the maximum value is achieved by a split or by replacing the entire subarray with the MEX is flawed. The function should correctly identify the MEX and apply it to the subarray, but it does not do so.

### Analysis of `make_stairs`:
- The function attempts to transform a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values, but it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. The function assumes that the MEX of a subarray is simply the length of the subarray, which is not always true. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and this function does not compute it correctly.

### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray. The MEX should be computed based on the presence of integers in the subarray, not just the length.
2. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The splitting logic in `func_1` and `func_2` does not correctly account for the MEX operation, leading to incorrect results.
3. **Inconsistent State Management**: The `make_stairs` function modifies the array and the `res` list, but it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation, leading to incorrect transformations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The MEX calculation is incorrect, and the logic for splitting and transforming the array does not align with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
