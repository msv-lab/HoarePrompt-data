Correctness: **False**.

Explanation of the incorrectness:
The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` by performing the specified operations. Specifically, the function `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray and apply the operations to maximize the sum. Additionally, the function `make_stairs` is not correctly designed to handle the transformation of the array based on the MEX value.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the input:
```
4
0 1 2 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
10 1
1 4
```

However, the program will not produce this output. The function `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to maximize a different value (which seems to be the sum of squared lengths of subarrays), rather than the sum of the array elements after performing the MEX operation. The `make_stairs` function also does not correctly handle the transformation of the array to achieve the maximum sum.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray. The MEX is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray, but the program does not implement this logic.
2. **Incorrect Sum Maximization**: The program attempts to maximize a different value (sum of squared lengths of subarrays) rather than the sum of the array elements after performing the MEX operation.
3. **Incorrect Transformation**: The `make_stairs` function is not correctly designed to transform the array to achieve the maximum sum. It does not handle the MEX operation and the subsequent assignment of the MEX value to the subarray elements.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
