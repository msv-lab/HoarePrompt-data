Postcondition: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user and always equals 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory `list` containing the adjacency lists of the nodes based on the input edges, `start` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `leaves` is a deque containing all nodes that have exactly one adjacent node in the `nodes` dictionary, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, and at least one move in `moves` is an odd number.**
