The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it into a list of test cases, and prints the results of applying `func_1` to these test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of integers `arr`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input data is processed and the results are printed to the standard output.
