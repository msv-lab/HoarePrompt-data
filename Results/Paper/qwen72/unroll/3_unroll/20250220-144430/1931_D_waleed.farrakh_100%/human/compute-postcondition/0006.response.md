Output State: `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first string in `data`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers and `arr` is a list of integers. Each tuple corresponds to a pair of consecutive lines from `data`, starting from the second line. `idx` is an integer equal to `1 + 2 * t`.
