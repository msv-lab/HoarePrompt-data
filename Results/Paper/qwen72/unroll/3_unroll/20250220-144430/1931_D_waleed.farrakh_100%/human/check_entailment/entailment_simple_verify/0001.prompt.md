You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, parsing the number of elements `n`, the integers `x` and `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.
   - The parsed data is stored in a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains `(n, x, y, arr)`.

2. **Beautiful Pairs Calculation (func_1):**
   - For each test case, the function `func_1` initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - `ry = a % y`: This is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary `freq`. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `count` because it means there are elements in the array that, when paired with the current element `a`, form a beautiful pair.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, `func_1` returns a list of results, which is then printed by `func_2`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The logic for calculating `rx` and `ry` is correct. `rx` ensures that the sum of the pair is divisible by `x`, and `ry` ensures that the difference of the pair is divisible by `y`.
  - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used correctly to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
  - The counter `count` is updated correctly for each element in the array.

- **Correctness of `func_2`:**
  - The input parsing is correct. It reads the entire input, splits it into lines, and processes each test case as described.
  - The test cases are correctly appended to the `test_cases` list.
  - The results from `func_1` are printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The input parsing and the calculation of beautiful pairs are both correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
