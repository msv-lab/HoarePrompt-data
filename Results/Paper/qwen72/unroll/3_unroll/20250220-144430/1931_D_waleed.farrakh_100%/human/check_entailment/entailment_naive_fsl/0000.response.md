Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - It iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs of remainders.
   - It calculates the remainders `rx` and `ry` for each element in the array.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary and increments the count if it is.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair of remainders.
   - It appends the count of beautiful pairs to the results list.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - It reads the input from standard input.
   - It processes the input to extract the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` with the list of test cases.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

The logic in `func_1` ensures that for each pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (where \(1 \le i < j \le n\)), the conditions \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\) are correctly checked by using the remainders. The frequency dictionary helps in efficiently counting the number of such pairs.

I have not found any edge cases or potential inputs where the program would fail to produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
