To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the initial state and the loop code.

### Initial State:
- `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from the second, third, and fourth values of each pair of lines in `data`, starting from the second line.
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the third line of each pair of lines in `data`.
- `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`.
- `input` remains a reference to `sys.stdin.read`.
- `data` remains the same list of strings as in the initial state.
- `results` is the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.
- For each `result` in `results`, the `print(result)` statement is executed, which prints the value of `result` to the console.

### Output State:
- The loop does not modify any variables in the initial state.
- The only action the loop performs is printing each element in `results` to the console.

### Natural Language Description:
- The loop prints each element in the `results` list to the console.
- The variables `test_cases`, `idx`, `input`, `data`, and `results` remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`. `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from the second, third, and fourth values of each pair of lines in `data`, starting from the second line. `arr` is a list of integers derived from the third line of each pair of lines in `data`. `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`. `input` remains a reference to `sys.stdin.read`. `data` remains the same list of strings as in the initial state. `results` is the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`.**
