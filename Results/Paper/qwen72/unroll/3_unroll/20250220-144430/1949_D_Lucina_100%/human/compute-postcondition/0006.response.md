Output State: **The list `xx` contains `n + 1` strings, where the first string is empty and the next `n` strings are the input strings. The lists `a` and `b` are of length `n + 1`, with `a[i]` and `b[i]` containing the counts of 'F' and 'S' characters, respectively, in the i-th row (and column) of the input matrix for all 1 <= i <= n. The elements at index 0 of `a` and `b` remain 0. The list `sa` is now an empty list.**
