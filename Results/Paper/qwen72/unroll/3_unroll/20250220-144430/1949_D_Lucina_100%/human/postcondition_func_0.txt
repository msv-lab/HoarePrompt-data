The function `func` processes a symmetric matrix of size n x n, where n is an integer between 2 and 24, and each element is one of 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', with the diagonal elements always being '.'. It reads the matrix from user input and counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in each row (and column) of the matrix. The function then categorizes rows into two lists, `sa` and `sb`, where `sa` contains rows with 'F' characters but no 'S' characters, and `sb` contains rows with 'S' characters but no 'F' characters. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, it appends rows with no 'F' or 'S' characters to `sa`. Otherwise, it appends these rows to `sb`. Finally, it prints a modified version of the matrix, replacing '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the content of `sa` or `sb` and the position of the '?' in the matrix. The function does not return any value, but it modifies and prints the matrix.
