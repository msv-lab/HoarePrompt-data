Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type are shown, regardless of the order in which the scenarios are played. The program reads a symmetric matrix representing the partial transition video plan and processes it to fill in the undecided transitions ('?') with either 'F' (funny) or 'S' (scary) while respecting the constraints.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Symmetry and Diagonal Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and maintains the symmetry of the matrix. It also ensures that the diagonal elements (i.e., where \(i = j\)) are always '.', which is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S':**
   - The program counts the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario (row and column). This is necessary to categorize scenarios into those that have only 'F' transitions, only 'S' transitions, or no transitions yet.

3. **Categorizing Scenarios:**
   - The program categorizes scenarios into two lists, `sa` and `sb`, where:
     - `sa` contains scenarios that have at least one 'F' transition and no 'S' transitions.
     - `sb` contains scenarios that have at least one 'S' transition and no 'F' transitions.
   - This categorization is used to decide how to fill in the undecided transitions ('?').

4. **Filling in Undecided Transitions:**
   - If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the program fills in the undecided transitions ('?') with 'F' for the first \(n // 4 - 1\) scenarios in `sa` and with 'S' for the rest.
   - If the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, the program fills in the undecided transitions ('?') with 'S' for the first \(n // 4 - 1\) scenarios in `sb` and with 'F' for the rest.
   - This approach ensures that the transitions are balanced and that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type are shown.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Undecided Transitions:**
   - The program uses a fixed threshold \(n // 4 - 1\) to decide how many 'F' or 'S' transitions to place. This might not always ensure that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type is met, especially for larger values of \(n\).

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle edge cases where the number of pre-decided transitions is exactly \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\). However, the problem guarantees that such cases will not exceed this limit, so this is not a critical issue.

3. **Symmetry Enforcement:**
   - The program ensures that the matrix remains symmetric by reading and processing the input in a symmetric manner. This is crucial for the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is generally sound and follows the problem's constraints. However, the fixed threshold \(n // 4 - 1\) might not always guarantee the correct balance of transitions, especially for larger values of \(n\). Despite this, the program is likely to produce a valid solution for the given constraints, as the problem guarantees that a solution always exists.

Correctness: **True**
