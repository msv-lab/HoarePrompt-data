Output State: **The list `sa` remains unchanged. The list `sb` remains unchanged. The list `xx`, and the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The length of `sa` is still greater than or equal to its initial length, and `t` is still equal to the initial length of `sa`. The loop prints a string `nx` for each row `i` from 1 to `n`. Each `nx` string is constructed by iterating through the characters of the corresponding row in `xx`. If a character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If a character is '?', and the row index `i` or column index `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.**
