Output State: **The function still takes three parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k, and a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. However, `n` and `k` are now specific integers provided by the user input, and the input format is expected to be two space-separated integers.**

In natural language: The function still expects the same parameters, but now `n` and `k` have been updated to specific integer values provided by the user input, and the input format is expected to be two space-separated integers. The other conditions and parameters remain unchanged.
