You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k (representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively, with 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's being pairwise different). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: The value of `wins` will be the number of elements in the list `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` up to the point where an element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element is found. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: wins - 1 (where wins is the number of elements in the list `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` up to the point where an element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element is found, and wins is greater than or equal to `k`)
        return
        #The program returns the current value of `wins`, which is greater than or equal to `k`.
    #State: The value of `wins` will be the number of elements in the list `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` up to the point where an element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element is found. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. Additionally, `wins` is less than `k`.
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: `win_with_swap` will be the number of elements in the list `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` from the initial `win_with_swap` position up to the point where an element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered, or `k-1` if no such element is found. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: - The `max` function will return the larger of the two values:
    #     - `wins - 1`
    #     - `win_with_swap - wins` (if `wins` is not 0)
    #     - `win_with_swap - 1` (if `wins` is 0)
    #
    #### Final Output:
    #- If `wins` is not 0, the output will be the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins`.
    #- If `wins` is 0, the output will be the maximum of `wins - 1` (which is -1) and `win_with_swap - 1`.
    #
    #Since `wins - 1` is -1 when `wins` is 0, the `max` function will always return `win_with_swap - 1` in this case.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of tuples `cows_info` where each tuple contains the number of cows `n` and your cow's index `k`, and a list of lists `ratings` where each sublist contains the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It returns the current value of `wins`, which is greater than or equal to `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the current value of `wins`, which is greater than or equal to `k`.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
