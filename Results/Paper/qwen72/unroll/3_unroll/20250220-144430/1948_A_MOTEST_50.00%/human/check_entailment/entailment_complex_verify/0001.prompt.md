You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer t and a list of integers n, where 1 <= t <= 50 and for each n in the list, 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The variable `t` is unchanged. The variable `s` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. For each iteration of the loop, if the input `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. For all other values of `n`, 'YES' is printed followed by a string `ans` that is constructed as follows: if `n` is even, `ans` is a string where each character from 'A' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in `s` is repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then each character from 'B' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in `s` is repeated twice.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It interacts with the user to clear the console screen, then prompts the user to input an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 50). For each of the `t` iterations, it prompts the user to input another integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans`. The string `ans` is constructed such that if `n` is even, each character from 'A' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in the uppercase English alphabet is repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then each character from 'B' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in the uppercase English alphabet is repeated twice. The function does not modify any external state or variables.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `n == 1`, there is no valid string that can be formed because a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. Therefore, it prints 'NO' for this case.

3. **String Construction:**
   - For `n > 1`, the program constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by repeating each character twice until it reaches `n` special characters. For example, if `n = 6`, it constructs the string 'AABBCC'.
   - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' to ensure the first three characters are special, and then continues to repeat each subsequent character twice until it reaches `n` special characters. For example, if `n = 5`, it constructs the string 'AAABB'.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string if a valid string is found.
   - The length of the constructed string is at most `200` because the maximum value of `n` is `50`, and the string is constructed by repeating characters at most `50` times.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and requirements. It ensures that the string has exactly `n` special characters and that the length of the string is within the specified limit. The special case for `n == 1` is also handled correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
