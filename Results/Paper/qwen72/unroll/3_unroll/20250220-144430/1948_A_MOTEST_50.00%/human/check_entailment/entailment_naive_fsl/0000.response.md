Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1, the program should print "NO" because it is impossible to construct a string with exactly one special character (a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors, which is not possible with only one special character). However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" for `n = 1` and does not provide a valid string for `n = 2` as required by the problem description. For `n = 2`, the program should print "YES" followed by a valid string like "MM", but it does not handle this case correctly.
