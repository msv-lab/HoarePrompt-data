Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by first reading the number of test cases `t` and then reading `n` for each test case. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Special Case Handling**: The function correctly identifies that there is no valid string for `n = 1` and prints 'NO'. This is because a single special character cannot have exactly one neighbor that is the same as itself.

3. **String Construction**:
   - For even `n`, the function constructs a string where each character from 'A' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in the uppercase English alphabet is repeated twice. This ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters, as each pair of repeated characters will have one special character in the middle.
   - For odd `n`, the function starts with 'AAA' and then constructs the rest of the string in a similar manner as for even `n`, but starting from 'B'. This ensures that the first three characters are special, and the remaining pairs of characters will also be special, totaling `n` special characters.

4. **Output Constraints**: The function ensures that the length of the constructed string is at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
   - For `n` values up to 50, the function will always produce a valid string, as the maximum length of the string is 100 (for `n = 50`), which is within the 200-character limit.

6. **Console Clearing**: The use of `os.system('cls')` to clear the console is not strictly necessary for the correctness of the algorithm, but it does not affect the logic of the function.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
