Output State: **The variable `t` is unchanged. The variable `s` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. For each iteration of the loop, if the input `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. For all other values of `n`, 'YES' is printed followed by a string `ans` that is constructed as follows: if `n` is even, `ans` is a string where each character from 'A' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in `s` is repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then each character from 'B' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in `s` is repeated twice.**
