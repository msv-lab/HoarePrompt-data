Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly addresses the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Condition**:
   - The program checks if `n == 1`. If so, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - For `n > 1`, the program constructs a string that satisfies the condition.

3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating pairs of the same character from the uppercase alphabet. This ensures that each character in the pair is special.
   - If `n` is odd, the program starts with "AAA" and then continues to add pairs of the same character. This ensures that the first three characters are special, and the rest of the characters in pairs are also special.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string if a valid string can be created.
   - It prints "NO" if `n == 1`.

The program ensures that the length of the constructed string is at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints. The logic for constructing the string is sound and meets the requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
