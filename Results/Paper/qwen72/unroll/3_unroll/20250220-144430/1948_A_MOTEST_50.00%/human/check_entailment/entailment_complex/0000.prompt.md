Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

# Annotated Program:
import os
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer t and a list of integers n, where 1 <= t <= 50 and for each n in the list, 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The variable `t` is unchanged. The variable `s` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. For each iteration of the loop, if the input `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. For all other values of `n`, 'YES' is printed followed by a string `ans` that is constructed as follows: if `n` is even, `ans` is a string where each character from 'A' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in `s` is repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then each character from 'B' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in `s` is repeated twice.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It interacts with the user to clear the console screen, then prompts the user to input an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 50). For each of the `t` iterations, it prompts the user to input another integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans`. The string `ans` is constructed such that if `n` is even, each character from 'A' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in the uppercase English alphabet is repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then each character from 'B' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in the uppercase English alphabet is repeated twice. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
