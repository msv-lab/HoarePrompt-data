The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure that the loop executes, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and the loop will execute `int(input())` times. The other states provided (t, n, and the list of tuples) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
