Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of integers n, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n[i] consisting of characters '<' and '>'. t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each n[i] is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all n[i] does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The strings represent the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, and no arrow points outside the grid.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reading the integer n and the two strings a and b for each case. For each test case, it checks if the second-to-last character of b is not '>', and if so, prints 'NO'. If n is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a path from the start to the end of the grid by examining the characters in the strings a and b. If no path is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The variables t, n, a, and b are updated for each iteration, but their final values after the loop are not specified as they depend on the input. The loop completes all iterations, and the function ends.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it checks if the second-to-last character of `b` is not '>', and if so, prints 'NO'. If `n` is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a path from the start to the end of the grid by examining the characters in the strings `a` and `b`. If no valid path is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated for each iteration, but their final values after the loop are not specified as they depend on the input. The loop completes all iterations, and the function ends.
