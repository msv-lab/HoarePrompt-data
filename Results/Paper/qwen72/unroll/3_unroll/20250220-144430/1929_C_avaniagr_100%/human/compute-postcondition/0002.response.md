The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function accepts multiple parameters: `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. Here, `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with specific ranges. The function likely processes these parameters and returns a result for each test case.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.

The function `func` processes these parameters and returns a result based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each of the `t` test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple parameters: `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with specific ranges. The function processes these parameters and returns a result for each test case.**
