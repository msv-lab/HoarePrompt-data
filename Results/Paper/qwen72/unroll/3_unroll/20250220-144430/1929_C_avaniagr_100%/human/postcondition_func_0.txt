The function `func` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on specific conditions. Each test case consists of three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the program state by printing the results. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged after the function concludes.
