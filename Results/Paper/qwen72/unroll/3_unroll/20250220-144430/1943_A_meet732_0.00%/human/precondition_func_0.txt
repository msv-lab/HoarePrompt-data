The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The total number of test cases, t, should satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.
