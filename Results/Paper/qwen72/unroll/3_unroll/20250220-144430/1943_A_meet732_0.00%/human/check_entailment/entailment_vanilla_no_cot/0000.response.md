Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical flaw in how it calculates the final score. The issue lies in the way the variable `c` is used and modified. The program incorrectly assumes that the optimal strategy can be determined by simply checking the count of each element and adjusting `c` accordingly. However, the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob involves a more nuanced approach to ensure that the MEX of the array `c` is maximized or minimized, respectively, based on their turns and the elements available.

### Explanation of the Flaw:
1. **Initialization of `c`:** The program initializes `c` as the minimum of 2 and the count of `0` in the array `a`. This is incorrect because the value of `c` should not be dependent on the count of `0` alone. Instead, it should be based on the optimal moves of both players.

2. **Modification of `c`:** The program then decrements `c` for each element `j` in the range from 1 to `n` if the count of `j` is less than 2. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the game's optimal play. The optimal play involves Alice and Bob making strategic choices based on the current state of the array `a` and the array `c`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game based on the optimal strategies of both players. Here's a correct approach:

1. **Count the Frequencies:** Count the frequency of each element in the array `a`.
2. **Determine the MEX:** Determine the MEX of the array `c` by considering the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Alice will try to include the smallest possible elements that are not yet in `c`, while Bob will try to prevent Alice from doing so.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                if cntl[j] == 0:
                    print(j)
                    break
                else:
                    mex += 1
            else:
                mex += 1
        else:
            print(mex)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Count the Frequencies:** We count the frequency of each element in the array `a` using `cntl`.
2. **Determine the MEX:** We iterate through the elements from 0 to `n` and check if the count of each element is less than 2. If the count is 0, we print the current element `j` as the MEX and break out of the loop. If the count is 1, we increment `mex` and continue. If the count is 2 or more, we also increment `mex` and continue. If we reach the end of the loop without breaking, we print `mex`.

This approach correctly simulates the game and determines the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal strategies of both players.
