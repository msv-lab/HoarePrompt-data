The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This value represents the number of test cases, `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the input is a valid integer and that this integer is greater than 0, as specified by the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 · 10^4**
