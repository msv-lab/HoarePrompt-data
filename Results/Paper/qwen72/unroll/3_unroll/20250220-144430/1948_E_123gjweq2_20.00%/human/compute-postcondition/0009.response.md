The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers where `left` is less than or equal to `right`. The difference `(right - left + 1)` represents the number of elements to be assigned in the list `arr`. `clique` is an integer that will be assigned to the elements in the range `[left, right]` in the list `cliques`. Both `arr` and `cliques` are lists of integers with at least `(right - left + 1)` elements each.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`, and assigns the value of `clique` to the elements in the range `[left, right]` in the list `cliques`. It does not return any value.**
