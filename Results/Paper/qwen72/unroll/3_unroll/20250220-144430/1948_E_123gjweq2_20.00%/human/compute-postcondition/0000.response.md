Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `(right - left + 1)` is the number of elements to be assigned in the array `arr`. `clique` is an integer representing the clique number to be assigned to the elements in the range `[left, right]` in the `cliquess` array. `arr` and `cliquess` are lists of integers with at least `(right - left + 1)` elements each. `small_element` is `left + 1`.**
