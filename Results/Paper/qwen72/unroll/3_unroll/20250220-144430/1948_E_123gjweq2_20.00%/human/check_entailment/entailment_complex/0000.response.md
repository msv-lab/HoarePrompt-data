Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Clique Calculation**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`. This is a reasonable approach because it ensures that the vertices are divided into the minimum number of cliques based on the given condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k`.

3. **Array Initialization**:
   - Two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to store the assigned values and the clique assignments, respectively.

4. **Segment Assignment**:
   - The program iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to assign values to the vertices and their corresponding cliques.
   - The `make_array` function is responsible for assigning values to the vertices in a specific pattern to ensure the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k` is met.

5. **Pattern Assignment in `make_array`**:
   - The function `make_array` divides the range `[left, right]` into two parts: the first half is assigned values from `left + 1` to `left + mid`, and the second half is assigned values from `right + 1 - (right - left + 1 - mid)` to `right + 1`.
   - This pattern ensures that the values assigned to the vertices are distinct and within the range `[1, n]`.
   - The `cliquess` array is updated to reflect the clique assignments for the vertices in the range `[left, right]`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the assigned values `arr`, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments `cliquess`.

However, there are a few issues with the provided code:

- **Incorrect Variable Names**:
  - The variable `cliquess` is used in `func_1` but is not modified in `make_array`. Instead, `cliquess` should be passed as a parameter to `make_array` and modified within the function.
  - The variable `arr` is modified in `make_array` but is not passed as a parameter to `make_array`. This will result in a `NameError` because `arr` is not defined in the scope of `make_array`.

- **Incorrect Output**:
  - The output for `cliquess` is incorrect because it remains unchanged. It should reflect the clique assignments.

To fix these issues, the `make_array` function should accept `arr` and `cliquess` as parameters and modify them accordingly. Here is the corrected version of the `make_array` function:

```python
def make_array(left, right, clique, arr, cliquess):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
```

And the `func_1` function should call `make_array` with the correct parameters:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1, arr, cliquess)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)
```

Given these corrections, the program will correctly assign values to the vertices and partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

Correctness: **False** (due to the issues mentioned above, the program is not correct as it stands).
