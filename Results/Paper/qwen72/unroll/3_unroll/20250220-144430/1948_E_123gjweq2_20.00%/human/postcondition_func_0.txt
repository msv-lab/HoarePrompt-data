The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 40, and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 2n. It divides the list `arr` into `cliques` segments, where each segment contains the same value corresponding to its segment index. The function prints the elements of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the elements of `cliquess` (which remains unchanged). The function does not return any value.
