The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer equal to 2.
   - `p` is a list of length 2 containing integers where `p_0` and `p_1` are the best friends of the 0-th and 1-st friend, respectively.
   - `v` is a list of length 3 with the first element being 0 and the remaining two elements being the integers provided by the user input.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print(2)` statement is executed.
   - The integer `2` is printed directly.

### Explanation:
- The `print(2)` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects defined in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
