Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive. `p` is a list of length `n` containing integers where `p_i` is the best friend of the i-th friend. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being 0 and the remaining elements being the integers provided by the user input. If `n` is 2, `p` is a list of length 2 containing integers where `p_0` and `p_1` are the best friends of the 0-th and 1-st friend, respectively, and `v` is a list of length 3 with the first element being 0 and the remaining two elements being the integers provided by the user input. If `n` is greater than 2, the loop will either print 2 and return, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything, leaving the variables `n`, `p`, and `v` unchanged.***
