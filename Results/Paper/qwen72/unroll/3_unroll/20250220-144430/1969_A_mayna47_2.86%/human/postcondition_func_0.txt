The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `p` from user input, where `n` represents the number of friends and `p` contains the best friend relationships. It then determines and prints the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. If `n` is 2, it prints 2. If `n` is greater than 2 and there exists a triplet of friends `i`, `v[i]`, and `v[v[i]]` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`, it prints 2. Otherwise, it prints 3. The function does not return any value.
