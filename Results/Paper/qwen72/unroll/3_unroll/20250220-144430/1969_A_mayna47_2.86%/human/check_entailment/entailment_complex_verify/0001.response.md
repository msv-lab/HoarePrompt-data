### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the number of friends `n` and initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros.
   - It then reads the list of best friends and appends it to `v` starting from index 1 to make the indices 1-based.

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`:**
   - If there are only 2 friends, the program prints 2 and returns. This is correct because in this case, Monocarp must invite both friends to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **Checking for Triplet Cycles:**
   - The program iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition is true if there is a cycle of length 3 (i.e., friend `i`'s best friend's best friend's best friend is `i`).
   - If such a cycle is found, the program prints 2 and returns. This is correct because in a cycle of length 3, inviting any 2 friends will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

5. **Default Case:**
   - If no cycle of length 3 is found, the program prints 3. This is based on the assumption that the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.
   - However, this assumption is incorrect. The program does not handle cases where there are multiple pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. For example, if `n = 4` and `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]`, friends 1 and 2 are each other's best friends, and friends 3 and 4 are each other's best friends. In this case, the program will print 3, but the correct answer is 2 because Monocarp can invite any one pair (e.g., friends 1 and 2) to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  5
  3 1 2 5 4
  4
  2 3 4 1
  2
  2 1
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  2
  3
  2
  ```
- **Explanation:**
  - For the first test case, the program correctly identifies a cycle of length 3 (friends 4 and 5) and prints 2.
  - For the second test case, the program does not identify any cycle of length 3 and prints 3, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 2 because friends 1 and 2 are each other's best friends.
  - For the third test case, the program correctly handles the special case and prints 2.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases where the minimum number of invitations required might be less than 3, specifically when there are multiple pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
