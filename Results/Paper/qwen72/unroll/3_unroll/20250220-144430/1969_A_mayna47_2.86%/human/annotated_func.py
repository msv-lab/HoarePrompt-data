#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list `p` of length `n` containing integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) where `p_i` is the best friend of the i-th friend. The function should calculate and return the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: The loop will either print 2 and return, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything, leaving the variables `n`, `p`, and `v` unchanged.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive. `p` is a list of length `n` containing integers where `p_i` is the best friend of the i-th friend. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being 0 and the remaining elements being the integers provided by the user input. If `n` is 2, `p` is a list of length 2 containing integers where `p_0` and `p_1` are the best friends of the 0-th and 1-st friend, respectively, and `v` is a list of length 3 with the first element being 0 and the remaining two elements being the integers provided by the user input. If `n` is greater than 2, the loop will either print 2 and return, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything, leaving the variables `n`, `p`, and `v` unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `p` from user input, where `n` represents the number of friends and `p` contains the best friend relationships. It then determines and prints the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. If `n` is 2, it prints 2. If `n` is greater than 2 and there exists a triplet of friends `i`, `v[i]`, and `v[v[i]]` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`, it prints 2. Otherwise, it prints 3. The function does not return any value.
