Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) where each integer represents the number of rounds played in each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains a trump suit (one of "CDHS") and a list of 2n cards (each card is a two-character string, with the first character being one of "23456789" and the second character being one of "CDHS", and all cards are different). The `trump` variable is assigned the value of user input, which is a string representing the trump suit. `trumps` is an empty list. `answers` is an empty list. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', and all values are `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
