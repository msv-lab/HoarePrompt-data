### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` positive integers whose sum is `x`.
   - The GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder.

2. **Approach**:
   - The key insight is that if `x` is divisible by `n`, then the GCD of the `n` sub-problems can be as large as `x // n`.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, we need to find the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `n` sub-problems can each have a difficulty of at least `d`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, the program iterates over all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` (using `isqrt`).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - Check if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, `i` is a valid GCD.
     - Check if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, `x // i` is a valid GCD.
   - The maximum of these valid GCDs is stored in `ans` and printed.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of `x` and checks if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
   - The use of `isqrt` to limit the range of divisors is efficient and correct.
   - The logic for updating `ans` with the maximum valid GCD is correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `x = 1` and `n = 1`, the only valid GCD is `1`.
   - For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only valid GCD is `1` because each sub-problem must have a difficulty of `1`.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For `x = 10` and `n = 3`:
     - Divisors of `10` are `1, 2, 5, 10`.
     - `10 // 2 = 5` and `n = 3 <= 5`, so `2` is a valid GCD.
     - `10 // 5 = 2` and `n = 3 <= 2` is false.
     - The maximum valid GCD is `2`.
   - For `x = 5` and `n = 5`:
     - Divisors of `5` are `1, 5`.
     - `5 // 5 = 1` and `n = 5 <= 1` is true, so `1` is the only valid GCD.
   - For `x = 420` and `n = 69`:
     - Divisors of `420` include `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420`.
     - `420 // 70 = 6` and `n = 69 <= 6` is false.
     - `420 // 6 = 70` and `n = 69 <= 70` is true, so `6` is a valid GCD.
     - The maximum valid GCD is `6`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD for the given problem. It efficiently checks all divisors up to the square root of `x` and updates the maximum valid GCD.

Correctness: **True**
