The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer with the constraint 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific output conditions are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1', and return a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1', and returns a result based on these inputs.**
