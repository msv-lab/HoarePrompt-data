Output State: **`S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, where each sublist `[x, y]` represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's in the string `a` up to that point. The last sublist in `S` will be `[count of '0's in a, count of '1's in a]`, `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0.**

The variable `satisfy` is initialized to 0, and the values of `S` and `ans` remain unchanged.
