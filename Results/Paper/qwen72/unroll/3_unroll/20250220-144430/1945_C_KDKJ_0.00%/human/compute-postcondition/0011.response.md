Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It computes the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's at each position in the string `a` and stores these counts in a list `S`. After processing, the function prints the index `ans` that satisfies the conditions: the cumulative count of '0's on the left side of the index is less than half the total count of characters on that side, and the cumulative count of '1's on the right side of the index is less than half the total count of characters on that side. If multiple indices satisfy these conditions, the one closest to the middle of the string is chosen. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
