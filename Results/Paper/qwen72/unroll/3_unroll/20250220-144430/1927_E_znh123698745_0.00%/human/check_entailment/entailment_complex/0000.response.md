### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The function initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then constructs the `answer` list by alternating between the beginning and the end of the `array`.
   - The `a` list is used to keep track of the current indices from which to pick the next element for the `answer` list. `a[0]` starts at 1 and increases, while `a[1]` starts at -1 and decreases.

3. **Alternation Logic**:
   - The alternation is controlled by the expression `(-1) ** i`. This expression alternates between 1 and -1 for even and odd values of `i`, respectively.
   - When `(-1) ** i` is -1, the function appends the element from the end of the `array` (using `a[-1]` and decrementing it).
   - When `(-1) ** i` is 1, the function appends the element from the beginning of the `array` (using `a[0]` and incrementing it).

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the constructed `answer` list for each test case.

5. **Validation of k-level Permutation**:
   - The key requirement is that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` in the permutation should differ by no more than 1.
   - The alternation logic ensures that the elements are distributed evenly between the beginning and the end of the array, which helps in balancing the sums of the segments.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the smallest possible values of `n` and `k` (e.g., `n = 2`, `k = 2`) correctly.
   - The function also handles larger values of `n` and `k` within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly construct a k-level permutation for the given problem description. The alternation logic ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` are balanced, meeting the requirement that any two sums differ by no more than 1.

### Correctness:
**True**
