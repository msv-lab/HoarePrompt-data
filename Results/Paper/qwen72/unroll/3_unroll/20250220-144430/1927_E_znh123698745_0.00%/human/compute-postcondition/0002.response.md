The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is even. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers with 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is even. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
