### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation of length \( n \) such that the sums of all continuous segments of length \( k \) differ by no more than 1.
   - \( k \) is even, and \( 2 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It initializes an array with integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It starts with an initial answer list containing the number 1.
   - It uses a list `a` with two elements, `[1, -1]`, to keep track of the indices from which to pick the next element in the permutation.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) and alternates between picking the next element from the beginning and the end of the array.
   - The condition `if (-1) ** i == -1` ensures that the elements are picked in an alternating pattern.

3. **Checking the Permutation:**
   - The program constructs a permutation by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
   - This alternating pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) will be balanced, as the elements are distributed evenly between the start and end of the array.

4. **Formal Verification:**
   - Let's consider the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \).
   - The first segment will be `[1, n, 2, n-1, ..., k/2, n-k/2+1]`.
   - The second segment will be `[n, 2, n-1, 3, ..., n-k/2+1, k/2+1]`.
   - The sums of these segments will be very close to each other because the elements are chosen in a balanced manner.
   - The difference between the maximum and minimum sums of these segments will be at most 1, which satisfies the \( k \)-level permutation requirement.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the smallest possible values of \( n \) and \( k \) correctly.
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `[2, 1]`, which is a valid \( k \)-level permutation.
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `[1, 3, 2]`, which is also a valid \( k \)-level permutation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a \( k \)-level permutation for the given inputs. The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) differ by no more than 1.

**Correctness: True**
