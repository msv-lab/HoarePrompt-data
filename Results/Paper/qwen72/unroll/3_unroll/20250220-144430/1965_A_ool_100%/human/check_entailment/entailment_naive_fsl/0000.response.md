Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where all piles have the same number of stones. According to the problem description, if all piles have the same number of stones, Alice can win by removing all stones from all piles in her first turn. However, the function `func_1` in the given program does not account for this scenario. For example, if the input is:

```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```

The expected output is "Alice", but the program will output "Bob" because it incorrectly toggles the `A` variable in the loop. This is a clear case where the program does not follow the problem description.
