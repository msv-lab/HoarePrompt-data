Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input using `sys.stdin.readline` and processes multiple test cases. This part is correct and efficiently handles input as per the problem's constraints.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the list of pile sizes, `arr`, for each test case. This is the correct approach to solve the problem for each test case.

3. **Initial Check in `func_1`**: The function checks if the smallest pile size is not 1. If the smallest pile size is greater than 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles in one move. This is correct.

4. **Checking Consecutive Differences**: The function then checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1. This is done by sorting the unique elements of `arr` and iterating through them. If any difference is greater than 1, the game is not in a continuous state, and the function alternates the boolean `A` to determine the winner. This logic is based on the idea that if the pile sizes are not consecutive, the player who starts (Alice) can always force a win by making the game state non-continuous.

5. **Final Adjustment**: If the pile sizes are consecutive, the function toggles `A` one more time. This is because in a continuous state, the player who starts (Alice) will lose if the number of unique pile sizes is even, and win if it is odd. This is correct.

6. **Output**: The function returns 'Alice' if `A` is True and 'Bob' otherwise. This is the correct way to determine the winner based on the logic described.

However, there is a minor issue in the input handling section:
- The variable `n` is read as a list of integers, but it should be a single integer representing the number of piles. This is a mistake in the input parsing.

Corrected Input Handling:
```python
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())  # Corrected to read a single integer
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    r = func_1(arr)
    print(r)
    t -= 1
```

Given the corrected input handling, the program should work correctly for the problem described.

Correctness: **True** (after the input handling correction)
