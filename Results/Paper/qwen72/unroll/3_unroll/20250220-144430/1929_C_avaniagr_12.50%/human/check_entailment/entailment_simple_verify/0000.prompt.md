You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    9
    
    2 1 7
    
    2 1 1
    
    2 3 15
    
    3 3 6
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 4 7
    
    4 88 1000000000
    
    25 69 231
    
    13 97 18806

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 3:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = 0
            for i in range(x + 1):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

                print('NO')
        
    #State: The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, but the loop has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to determine if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
For the input `k = 2`, `x = 2`, and `a = 2`, the program should output "YES" because Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins. Here's a strategy that works:

1. Sasha bets 1 coin.
2. If he wins, he has 3 coins. He can then bet 1 coin again, and if he wins, he will have 4 coins.
3. If he loses, he has 1 coin left. He can then bet 1 coin again, and if he wins, he will have 2 coins. He can repeat this process until he wins.

Since Sasha cannot lose more than 2 times in a row, he can always recover and eventually win any number of coins. However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this case. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the logic for all possible inputs.
