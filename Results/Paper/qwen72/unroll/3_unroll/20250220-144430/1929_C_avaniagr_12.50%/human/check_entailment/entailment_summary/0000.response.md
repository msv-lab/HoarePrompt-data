### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place a bet of `y` coins.
   - If he wins, he gets `y * k` coins (his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`).
   - If he loses, he loses `y` coins.
   - Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - Initially, Sasha has `a` coins.
   - The goal is to determine if Sasha can guarantee having at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If Sasha can always recover from a series of losses, he can potentially win an unlimited number of coins.
   - The recovery strategy involves placing bets such that even after `x` consecutive losses, he can still place a bet and potentially win back his losses.

3. **Conditions for Guaranteeing Unlimited Coins:**
   - **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**
     - If Sasha can lose fewer times than the number of times his bet is increased in case of a win, he can always recover. For example, if \( k = 2 \) and \( x = 1 \), he can place a bet of 1 coin and recover after one loss.
     - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to place the initial bet and recover from `x` losses.
   - **Case 2: \( x = k - 1 \)**
     - If Sasha can lose exactly `k - 1` times in a row, he needs more initial coins to guarantee recovery. Specifically, he needs at least `x + 3` coins to ensure he can place the initial bet, recover from `x` losses, and still have enough to place another bet.
   - **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**
     - If Sasha can lose more times than the number of times his bet is increased, he needs a more complex strategy. The program calculates a threshold `z` which represents the minimum number of coins needed to guarantee recovery from `x` losses.
     - The loop `for i in range(x + 1): z += z // (k - 1) + 1` calculates this threshold. The idea is to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins, ensuring he has enough coins to continue betting.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `k`, `x`, and `a`.
   - It then checks the conditions:
     - If \( x < k - 1 \), it checks if `a >= x + 1`.
     - If \( x == k - 1 \), it checks if `a >= x + 3`.
     - If \( x > k - 1 \), it calculates `z` and checks if `a >= z`.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The conditions and the logic used in the program align with the problem's requirements.
   - The threshold `z` is calculated correctly to ensure Sasha can recover from `x` consecutive losses and still have enough coins to continue betting.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.
