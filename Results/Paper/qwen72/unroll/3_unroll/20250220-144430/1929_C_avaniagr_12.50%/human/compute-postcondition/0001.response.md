The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The state of `t` is an input integer, but for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a dummy variable and does not need an initial value as it will be assigned by the `range(t)` function.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
