The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it starts from 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
