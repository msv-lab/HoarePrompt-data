You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        bullets_used = 0
        can_survive = True
        for (pos, health) in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists `a` and `x` of length `n` from the input. It then determines whether a player can survive an attack from `n` monsters, each with a position `x_i` and health `a_i`. The player can survive if the total number of bullets used to defeat all monsters (where each monster requires `a_i` bullets) does not exceed the maximum distance `k` multiplied by the absolute position of the monster. The function prints 'YES' if the player can survive the attack for the current test case, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the number of bullets you can fire per second `k`. It then reads the health values `a` and the positions `x` of the monsters.

2. **Sorting Monsters**: The program sorts the monsters based on their distance from the character (i.e., the absolute value of their positions). This is a crucial step because it ensures that the closest monsters are targeted first, which is necessary to prevent them from reaching the character.

3. **Bullet Calculation**: The program iterates through the sorted list of monsters and calculates the total number of bullets needed to kill each monster. It keeps track of the total bullets used so far (`bullets_used`). For each monster, it checks if the total number of bullets needed to kill it (`bullets_used + health`) exceeds the number of bullets that can be fired before the monster reaches the character (`distance * k`).

4. **Survival Check**: If the total bullets needed exceed the number of bullets that can be fired before the monster reaches the character, the program sets `can_survive` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. This is the correct logic because if you can't kill a monster before it reaches you, you lose.

5. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if you can survive and "NO" otherwise, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if all monsters are far enough away and you have enough bullets per second, it will correctly output "YES". If any monster is too close and you don't have enough bullets, it will correctly output "NO".

7. **Efficiency**: The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints given in the problem. Sorting the monsters takes \(O(n \log n)\) time, and the subsequent loop through the monsters takes \(O(n)\) time, making the overall complexity \(O(n \log n)\) per test case, which is feasible given the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should work as intended for the problem described.
