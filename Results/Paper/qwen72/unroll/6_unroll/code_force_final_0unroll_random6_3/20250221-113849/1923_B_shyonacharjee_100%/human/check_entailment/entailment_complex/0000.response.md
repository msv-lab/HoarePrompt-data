### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `x`.
   - The input handling is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Monster Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player using `sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))`.
   - This ensures that the closest monsters are processed first, which is crucial for the strategy of surviving the game.

3. **Bullet Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of bullets needed to kill each monster and adds it to `bullets_used`.
   - It checks if the total bullets needed to kill the current monster exceed the product of the distance to the monster and the number of bullets that can be fired per second (`k`).
   - If the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k` is true, it means the player cannot survive because the monster will reach the player before it can be killed.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if the player can survive the attack for the current test case, and 'NO' otherwise.
   - The output format is correct and matches the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive the attack of all monsters. It processes each test case independently, sorts the monsters based on their distance, and checks if the player can kill each monster before it reaches the player. The conditions and calculations are consistent with the problem requirements.
