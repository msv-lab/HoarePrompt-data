#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, cases is a list of tuples, each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: hcf is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list `numbers` of the first tuple in `cases`. The values of `t` and `cases` remain unchanged.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list `numbers` of the first tuple in `cases`. The values of `t` and `cases` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list. The function does not modify the input list `numbers` or any other external variables.
