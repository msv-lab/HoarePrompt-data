Reasoning:  
The given program aims to solve the problem by calculating the product of all multipliers `k_i` and then distributing the bets in such a way that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the product of the multipliers divided by the highest common factor (HCF) of the bets. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Product Calculation:**
   - The variable `m` is initialized to 1.
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `k_i` and stores it in `m`.

3. **Bet Calculation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `c` to store the bets.
   - For each outcome, it calculates the bet as `m / k_i` and appends it to `c`.

4. **HCF Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the HCF of a list of numbers.
   - The program calculates the HCF of the list `c` and stores it in `hcf`.

5. **Bet Adjustment:**
   - The program divides each bet in `c` by the HCF to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratio.
   - It then checks if the sum of the bets is strictly less than `m / hcf`.

6. **Output:**
   - If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`, the program prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution of bets exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the adjusted bets.

### Analysis:
- **Product Calculation:**
  - The product `m` of all multipliers `k_i` is used to ensure that the bets are proportional to the multipliers.
  - This approach ensures that the bets are large enough to cover the requirement of being strictly greater than the sum of all bets when any one outcome wins.

- **HCF Calculation:**
  - The HCF of the bets is calculated to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratio.
  - This step is crucial to ensure that the bets are within the constraints (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9).

- **Sum Check:**
  - The program checks if the sum of the adjusted bets is strictly less than `m / hcf`.
  - If this condition is met, the bets are valid; otherwise, the program outputs `-1`.

### Issues:
- **Overflow:**
  - The product `m` can become very large, especially when `n` is large and the multipliers are large.
  - However, since the problem guarantees that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the multipliers are between 2 and 20, the product `m` should not overflow for the given constraints.

- **HCF Calculation:**
  - The HCF calculation is correct and ensures that the bets are minimized while maintaining the required ratio.

- **Sum Check:**
  - The sum check is correctly implemented to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winning amount for any outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic and handles the constraints appropriately. The HCF calculation and the sum check ensure that the bets are valid and meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
