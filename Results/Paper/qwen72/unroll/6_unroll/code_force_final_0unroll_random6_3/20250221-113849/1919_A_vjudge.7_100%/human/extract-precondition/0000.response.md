Precondition: **The function should take two integers a and b as inputs, where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.** 

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def wallet_game(a, b):
```

With the correct precondition:

Precondition: **a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.**
