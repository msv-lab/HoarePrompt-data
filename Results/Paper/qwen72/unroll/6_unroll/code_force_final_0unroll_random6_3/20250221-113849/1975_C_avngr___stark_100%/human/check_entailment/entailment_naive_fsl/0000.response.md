Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not handle the correct logic for all potential cases. Specifically, it only considers subarrays of length 3, which is insufficient to solve the problem as described. The problem requires considering subarrays of any length (2 ≤ l < r ≤ n) and finding the maximum possible value that the array can be transformed into.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
2
3
1 2 3
4
1 3 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
2
```

In the second test case, the program outputs 2, but the correct answer should be 3. Here's why:

- For the subarray [1, 3, 2, 4], the median of the subarray [1, 3, 2] is 2, and the median of the subarray [3, 2, 4] is 3.
- If Mocha chooses the interval (l, r) = (2, 4), the subarray [3, 2, 4] has a median of 3, and the array can be transformed to [1, 3, 3, 3].
- If Mocha then chooses the interval (l, r) = (1, 4), the subarray [1, 3, 3, 3] has a median of 3, and the array can be transformed to [3, 3, 3, 3].

Thus, the maximum possible value of the number is 3, but the program incorrectly outputs 2.
