Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, if `n` is 2, the function prints the minimum value of the two elements in the array `a`. If `n` is greater than 2, the function prints the maximum of the second largest elements from every consecutive triplet in the array `a`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are reset for each new test case. **
