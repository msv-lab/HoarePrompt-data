### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is not defined with parameters, but it reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the list of multipliers `a`.

2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculation:**
   - The function `lcm` is defined to calculate the LCM of a list of integers. This is done by iteratively computing the LCM of the current value `g` and the next element in the list.
   - The LCM is used to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that the total sum of bets is less than the product of the LCM and the multiplier of the winning outcome.

3. **Betting Strategy:**
   - The function calculates the LCM of the multipliers `a` and then modifies each element in `a` to be `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM.
   - This ensures that the total sum of bets `sumo` is the sum of these modified values.
   - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it means that the total amount of coins bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, so it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the space-separated string of the modified elements in `a`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where no valid distribution of coins is possible (i.e., `sumo >= prod`).
   - It also handles the case where a valid distribution is possible, ensuring that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

5. **Constraints:**
   - The constraints are respected: `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n <= 50`, and `2 <= k_i <= 20`.
   - The function ensures that the bets are within the valid range `1 <= x_i <= 10^9`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
