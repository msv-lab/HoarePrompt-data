Reasoning:  
The program aims to find a distribution of bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome. The approach taken by the program is to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` and then distribute the bets in such a way that the bet on the i-th outcome is `LCM / k_i`. This ensures that the total sum of bets is `sum(LCM / k_i)`, and the amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * (LCM / k_i) = LCM`.

The key condition to check is whether the total sum of bets `sumo` is strictly less than `LCM`. If `sumo >= LCM`, it means there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and the program correctly outputs `-1`. If `sumo < LCM`, the program outputs the bets, which is a valid solution.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The LCM of the multipliers can be very large, especially when the multipliers are large and the number of outcomes is high. This can lead to integer overflow or performance issues. Despite this, the program is logically correct in its approach, and the constraints in the problem (1 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) ensure that the LCM will not exceed a manageable size.

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `3 3 2 7`
   - LCM of [3, 2, 7] is 42.
   - Bets: `42 // 3 = 14`, `42 // 2 = 21`, `42 // 7 = 6`.
   - Sum of bets: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`.
   - Since `41 < 42`, the program outputs `14 21 6`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2 3 3`
   - LCM of [3, 3] is 3.
   - Bets: `3 // 3 = 1`, `3 // 3 = 1`.
   - Sum of bets: `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Since `2 < 3`, the program outputs `1 1`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `5 5 5 5 5 5`
   - LCM of [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] is 5.
   - Bets: `5 // 5 = 1`, `5 // 5 = 1`, `5 // 5 = 1`, `5 // 5 = 1`, `5 // 5 = 1`.
   - Sum of bets: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
   - Since `5 >= 5`, the program outputs `-1`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `6 7 9 3 17 9 13`
   - LCM of [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13] is 119379.
   - Bets: `119379 // 7 = 17054`, `119379 // 9 = 13264`, `119379 // 3 = 39793`, `119379 // 17 = 7023`, `119379 // 9 = 13264`, `119379 // 13 = 9183`.
   - Sum of bets: `17054 + 13264 + 39793 + 7023 + 13264 + 9183 = 109581`.
   - Since `109581 < 119379`, the program outputs `17054 13264 39793 7023 13264 9183`.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `3 6 3 2`
   - LCM of [6, 3, 2] is 6.
   - Bets: `6 // 6 = 1`, `6 // 3 = 2`, `6 // 2 = 3`.
   - Sum of bets: `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
   - Since `6 >= 6`, the program outputs `-1`.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `5 9 4 6 8 3`
   - LCM of [9, 4, 6, 8, 3] is 72.
   - Bets: `72 // 9 = 8`, `72 // 4 = 18`, `72 // 6 = 12`, `72 // 8 = 9`, `72 // 3 = 24`.
   - Sum of bets: `8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24 = 71`.
   - Since `71 < 72`, the program outputs `8 18 12 9 24`.

The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the problem's constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
