You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not defined with any parameters, but based on the problem description, it should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `cases` where each inner list contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `k` of length `n`. For each test case, `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n <= 50`, and `2 <= k_i <= 20` for all `1 <= i <= n`.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        def lcm(l):
            g = 1
            for i in range(len(l)):
                g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
            return g
        
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = lcm(a)
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, `func` remains undefined, and the loop has processed `t` test cases. For each test case, the list `a` is modified such that each element is the result of `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original elements in `a`. The variable `sumo` is the sum of the modified elements in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the output for that test case is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is a space-separated string of the modified elements in `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `k` of length `n`. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
