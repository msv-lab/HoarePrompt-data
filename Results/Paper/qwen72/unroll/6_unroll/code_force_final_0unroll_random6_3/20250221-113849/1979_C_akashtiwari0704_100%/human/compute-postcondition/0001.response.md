To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `T` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `T` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

Given the problem description, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it must be within the range `1 <= t <= 10^4` for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and within the range `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `T` is 0**
