You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
    
        def lcm(l):
            g = 1
            for i in range(len(l)):
                g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
            return g
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        prod = lcm(a)
        sumo = 0
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `bets` and a list of integers `a` from the input. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, then modifies each element in `a` to be the result of `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM. It sums the modified elements in `a` to get `sumo`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints a space-separated string of the modified elements in `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), the amount received if it wins is \(k_i \times x_i\), where \(k_i\) is the multiplier and \(x_i\) is the bet.
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Approach:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - It then sets each bet \(x_i\) to \(\frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i}\).
   - The sum of all bets is calculated and compared to the LCM.
   - If the sum of bets is less than the LCM, the solution is valid; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are proportional to the multipliers.
   - This approach ensures that the total amount bet is a common multiple of all multipliers, which helps in comparing the total bet to the individual winnings.

4. **Sum of Bets:**
   - The sum of the bets is calculated as \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i}\).
   - If this sum is less than the LCM, it means that the total amount bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome, satisfying the condition.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all multipliers \(k_i\) are the same, the sum of bets will be equal to the LCM, which is not strictly less than the LCM. Hence, the program correctly prints \(-1\) in such cases.
   - For different multipliers, the program should find a valid solution if one exists.

6. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the multipliers for each test case.
   - It calculates the LCM of the multipliers and sets the bets accordingly.
   - It checks if the sum of bets is less than the LCM and prints the result.

### Correctness:
- The program follows the correct logic to solve the problem.
- It handles the edge case where all multipliers are the same and prints \(-1\).
- It correctly calculates the bets and checks the condition.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
