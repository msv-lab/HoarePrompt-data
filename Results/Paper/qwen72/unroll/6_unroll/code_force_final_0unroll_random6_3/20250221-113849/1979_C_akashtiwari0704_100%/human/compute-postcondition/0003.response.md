The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and `cases` is a list where each inner list contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `k` of length `n`. The constraints are `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n <= 50`, and `2 <= k_i <= 20` for all `1 <= i <= n`.

The function processes each test case and returns a list of results. Each result corresponds to a test case and is based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `k` of length `n`. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
