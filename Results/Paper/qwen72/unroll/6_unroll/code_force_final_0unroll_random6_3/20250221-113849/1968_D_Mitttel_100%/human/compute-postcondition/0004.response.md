To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while not vis[s] and k > 0:
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
1. `vis[s]` - This condition checks if the element at index `s` in the list `vis` is `False` (i.e., `vis[s]` is 0).
2. `k` - This condition checks if `k` is greater than 0.

### Current State:
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\).
- `s` is a list of two integers \([P_B, P_S]\) where \(1 \leq P_B, P_S \leq n\).
- `k` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
- `n` is the length of `p`, and the length of `a` and `p` is `n`, and \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `mx` is 0.
- `cur` is 0.
- `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1: `not vis[s]`**
  - `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, so `vis[s]` will be 0 for any valid `s` (since `s` contains indices within the range of `vis`).
  - Therefore, `not vis[s]` will be `True` because `vis[s]` is 0.

- **Condition 2: `k > 0`**
  - `k` is a positive integer, so `k > 0` is already `True`.

### Conclusion:
- Both conditions in the loop head (`not vis[s]` and `k > 0`) are already satisfied with the given state.
- No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\), `s` is a list of two integers \([P_B, P_S]\) where \(1 \leq P_B, P_S \leq n\), `k` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `n` is the length of `p`, and the length of `a` and `p` is `n`, and \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**
