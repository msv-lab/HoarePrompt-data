Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] where 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n, `k` is a positive integer where 1 <= k <= 10^9, `n` is the length of `p`, and the length of `a` and `p` is `n`, and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**

The code initializes a new list `vis` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
