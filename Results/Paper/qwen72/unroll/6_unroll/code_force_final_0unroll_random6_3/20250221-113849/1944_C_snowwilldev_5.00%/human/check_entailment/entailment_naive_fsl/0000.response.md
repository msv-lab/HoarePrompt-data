Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players. Specifically, the logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program checks if the count of any integer `i` is 1 and increments a counter `t`. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or if the count of `i` is 0, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This approach does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob play optimally.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
0 1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice can pick `1` first, resulting in `a = [0, 1, 2]` and `c = [1]`.
- Bob can pick `0`, resulting in `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [1]`.
- Alice can pick `1`, resulting in `a = [2]` and `c = [1, 1]`.
- Bob can pick `2`, resulting in `a = []` and `c = [1, 1]`.

The final array `c` is `[1, 1]`, and the MEX of `[1, 1]` is `0`. However, Alice and Bob can play optimally to achieve a higher MEX. For example:
- Alice can pick `0` first, resulting in `a = [1, 1, 2]` and `c = [0]`.
- Bob can pick `1`, resulting in `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [0]`.
- Alice can pick `1`, resulting in `a = [2]` and `c = [0, 1]`.
- Bob can pick `2`, resulting in `a = []` and `c = [0, 1]`.

The final array `c` is `[0, 1]`, and the MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`. However, the optimal strategy would be:
- Alice can pick `0` first, resulting in `a = [1, 1, 2]` and `c = [0]`.
- Bob can pick `1`, resulting in `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [0]`.
- Alice can pick `2`, resulting in `a = [1]` and `c = [0, 2]`.
- Bob can pick `1`, resulting in `a = []` and `c = [0, 2]`.

The final array `c` is `[0, 2]`, and the MEX of `[0, 2]` is `3`.

The program fails to consider the optimal strategy and thus does not produce the correct output for every potential case.
