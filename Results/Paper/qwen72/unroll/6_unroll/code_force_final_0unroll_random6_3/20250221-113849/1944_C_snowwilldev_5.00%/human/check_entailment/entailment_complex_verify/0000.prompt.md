You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a, and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The total number of test cases t is given, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and it is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints the smallest index i such that the element a[i] appears exactly once in the array a, or the smallest index i such that the element i is not present in the array a, and then breaks out of the loop. The values of `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and `t` are updated for each test case, but their final states are not predictable without the specific input values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the smallest index `i` such that the element `a[i]` appears exactly once in the array `a`, or the smallest index `i` such that the element `i` is not present in the array `a`, and then breaks out of the loop. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The values of `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and `t` are updated for each test case, but their final states are not predictable without the specific input values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players. Specifically, the logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program checks if the count of any integer `i` is 1 and increments a counter `t`. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or if the count of `i` is 0, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This approach does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob play optimally.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
0 1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice can pick `1` first, resulting in `a = [0, 1, 2]` and `c = [1]`.
- Bob can pick `0`, resulting in `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [1]`.
- Alice can pick `1`, resulting in `a = [2]` and `c = [1, 1]`.
- Bob can pick `2`, resulting in `a = []` and `c = [1, 1]`.

The final array `c` is `[1, 1]`, and the MEX of `[1, 1]` is `0`. However, Alice and Bob can play optimally to achieve a higher MEX. For example:
- Alice can pick `0` first, resulting in `a = [1, 1, 2]` and `c = [0]`.
- Bob can pick `1`, resulting in `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [0]`.
- Alice can pick `1`, resulting in `a = [2]` and `c = [0, 1]`.
- Bob can pick `2`, resulting in `a = []` and `c = [0, 1]`.

The final array `c` is `[0, 1]`, and the MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`. However, the optimal strategy would be:
- Alice can pick `0` first, resulting in `a = [1, 1, 2]` and `c = [0]`.
- Bob can pick `1`, resulting in `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [0]`.
- Alice can pick `2`, resulting in `a = [1]` and `c = [0, 2]`.
- Bob can pick `1`, resulting in `a = []` and `c = [0, 2]`.

The final array `c` is `[0, 2]`, and the MEX of `[0, 2]` is `3`.

The program fails to consider the optimal strategy and thus does not produce the correct output for every potential case.
