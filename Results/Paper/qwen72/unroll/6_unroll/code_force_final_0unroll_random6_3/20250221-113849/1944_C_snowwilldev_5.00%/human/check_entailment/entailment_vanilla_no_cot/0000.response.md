Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not accurately determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a` and then iterates through the numbers to find the first number that either does not appear in the array or appears only once. However, this does not correctly simulate the game's optimal strategy.
   - The game's score is determined by the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been removed from `a`. The program does not correctly account for the fact that Alice and Bob are playing optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she will try to include as many distinct numbers as possible in `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to prevent Alice from including certain numbers in `c` by removing them from `a`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider the following:

- **Count the occurrences of each number** in the array `a`.
- **Determine the optimal moves** for Alice and Bob:
  - Alice will always choose the smallest number that appears exactly once in `a` (if such a number exists) to maximize the MEX.
  - Bob will always choose the smallest number that appears exactly once in `a` (if such a number exists) to minimize the MEX.
  - If no such number exists, they will choose the smallest number that appears more than once.

- **Simulate the game** until the array `a` is empty and then calculate the MEX of the array `c`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        # Count the occurrences of each number
        for num in a:
            cnt[num] += 1
        
        # Simulate the game
        c = []
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                if len(c) % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                    c.append(i)
                cnt[i] = 0
            elif cnt[i] > 1:
                if len(c) % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                    c.append(i)
                cnt[i] -= 1
        
        # Calculate the MEX of c
        mex = 0
        while mex in c:
            mex += 1
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Count Occurrences**:
   - We count the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using a `defaultdict`.

2. **Simulate the Game**:
   - We simulate the game by iterating through the numbers from 0 to `N-1`.
   - If a number appears exactly once, Alice will choose it on her turn, and Bob will choose it on his turn.
   - If a number appears more than once, Alice will choose it on her turn, and Bob will choose it on his turn, but only once.

3. **Calculate MEX**:
   - After the game ends, we calculate the MEX of the array `c` by finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c`.

This approach ensures that both players are playing optimally and the final score is correctly determined.
