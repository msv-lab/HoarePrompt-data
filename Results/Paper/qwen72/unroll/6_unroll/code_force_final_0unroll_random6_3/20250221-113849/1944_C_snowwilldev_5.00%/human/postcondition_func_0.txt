The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the smallest index `i` such that the element `a[i]` appears exactly once in the array `a`, or the smallest index `i` such that the element `i` is not present in the array `a`, and then breaks out of the loop. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The values of `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and `t` are updated for each test case, but their final states are not predictable without the specific input values.
