### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where `a` is the number of 1x1 icons and `b` is the number of 2x2 icons.

2. **Calculations:**
   - The variable `t` is initially set to `b * 2`, which is the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - The function then calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons:
     - If `t % 5 == 0`, it means `t` is a multiple of 5, and the number of screens required is `t // 5`.
     - Otherwise, it adds 1 to `t // 5` to account for the remaining cells that do not fill a complete screen.
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1 >= a`, it means there are enough remaining cells to place all the 1x1 icons, so the number of screens remains `t`.
   - If `t1 < a`, it means there are not enough remaining cells, and additional screens are needed:
     - The variable `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, which is the number of 1x1 icons that need additional screens.
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, it means `t2` is a multiple of 15, and the number of additional screens required is `t2 // 15`.
     - Otherwise, it adds 1 to `t2 // 15` to account for the remaining icons that do not fill a complete screen.
   - The final number of screens required is printed.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `a` and `b` are both 0 correctly, as it will print 0.
   - The function also handles the case where `a` is 0 and `b` is non-zero correctly, as it will calculate the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.
   - The function handles the case where `b` is 0 and `a` is non-zero correctly, as it will calculate the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons.

4. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correct.
   - The logic for calculating the remaining cells and the additional screens required for 1x1 icons is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The calculations and conditions are handled appropriately, and the program should produce the correct output for the given problem description.

**Correctness: True**
