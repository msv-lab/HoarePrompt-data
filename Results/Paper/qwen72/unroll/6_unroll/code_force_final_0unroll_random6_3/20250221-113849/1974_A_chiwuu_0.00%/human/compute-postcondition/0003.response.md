The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return conditions are not provided in the output section. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two non-negative integers `x` and `y` within the range 0 to 99, and return a value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
