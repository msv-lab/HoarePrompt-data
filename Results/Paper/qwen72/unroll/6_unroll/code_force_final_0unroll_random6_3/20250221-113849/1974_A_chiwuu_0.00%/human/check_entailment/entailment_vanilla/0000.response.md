### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).
   - The formula `t = b * 2` is used to determine the total number of 2x2 icons, which is then divided by 5 to find the number of screens needed. If there is a remainder, it adds 1 to the screen count. This is correct because each screen can hold up to 3 (15/5) 2x2 icons, and any remaining icons will require an additional screen.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. This is done using `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If the remaining cells `t1` are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`a`), it does not change the screen count `t`.

4. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional number of screens required for the 1x1 icons. This is done using `t2 = a - t1`.
   - The formula `t = t + t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 > 0)` is used to determine the additional screens needed. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, it adds `t2 // 15` screens. Otherwise, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` screens to account for the remaining icons that do not fill a complete screen.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the placement of 2x2 icons and calculates the number of screens needed for them.
- It also correctly calculates the remaining cells and determines if they are sufficient for the 1x1 icons.
- If additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons, it correctly calculates the number of additional screens required.

However, there is a minor issue in the logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. The formula `t = b * 2` is incorrect because it should be `t = b * 4` since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. This mistake affects the subsequent calculations.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 4
        if t % 15 == 0:
            t = t // 15
        else:
            t = t // 15 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

### Final Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the calculation of `t` for 2x2 icons.
- After correcting the error, the program should work correctly.

Correctness: **False** (due to the logical error in the initial calculation of `t` for 2x2 icons).
