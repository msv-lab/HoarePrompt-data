The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range determined by the input. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state before the loop starts provides information about the expected input and constraints, but these do not directly affect the loop head. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer to make the loop execute.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `input()` must be a positive integer**
