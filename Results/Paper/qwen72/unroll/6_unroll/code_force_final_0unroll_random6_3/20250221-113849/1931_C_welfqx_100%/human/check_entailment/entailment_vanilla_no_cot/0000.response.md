Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Checking if All Elements are Equal**:
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are already equal and prints `0` if they are. This part is correct.

2. **Finding the Longest Prefix and Suffix of Equal Elements**:
   - The program attempts to find the longest prefix and suffix of equal elements and then calculates the minimum cost as `n - max(cn, ck)`.
   - However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to make all elements equal by selecting the most frequent element in the array and applying the operation to the minimum range necessary.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
1. **Count the Frequency of Each Element**:
   - Use a dictionary or a counter to count the frequency of each element in the array.
2. **Find the Most Frequent Element**:
   - Identify the element with the highest frequency.
3. **Calculate the Minimum Cost**:
   - The minimum cost to make all elements equal is the length of the array minus the frequency of the most frequent element. This is because you can set all other elements to the most frequent element in one operation, and the cost will be the number of elements that are not the most frequent.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for r in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
        
        # Count the frequency of each element
        freq = Counter(num)
        
        # Find the most frequent element
        max_freq = max(freq.values())
        
        # Calculate the minimum cost
        min_cost = n - max_freq
        
        print(min_cost)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `6 1 2 3 4 5 1`, the most frequent element is `1` with a frequency of `2`. The minimum cost is `6 - 2 = 4`.
- For the input `7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`, all elements are already equal, so the cost is `0`.
- For the input `8 8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8`, the most frequent element is `8` with a frequency of `5`. The minimum cost is `8 - 5 = 3`.

The provided program fails to correctly handle these cases, leading to incorrect results.
