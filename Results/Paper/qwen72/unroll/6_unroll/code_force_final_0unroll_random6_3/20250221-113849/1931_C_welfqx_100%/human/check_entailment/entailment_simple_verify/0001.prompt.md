You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) for the array a, with each element a_i satisfying 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: The function will print the number of elements that need to be removed from each test case array to make it a palindrome, and the loop will complete all iterations for the given number of test cases `t`. The variables `r`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `onum`, `cn`, `ck`, `symb1`, and `symb2` will have their final values based on the last test case processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `num`.

2. **Initial Check for All Elements Being Equal:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are already equal by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the next one.
   - If all elements are equal or the array has only one element, the cost is `0` because no operation is needed.

3. **Handling Non-Uniform Arrays:**
   - If the array is not uniform, the program creates a reversed copy of the array `onum`.
   - It then counts the number of consecutive elements that are equal from the start of the original array (`cn`) and from the start of the reversed array (`ck`).
   - If the first element of the original array (`symb1`) is equal to the first element of the reversed array (`symb2`), it adds the counts `cn` and `ck` together.
   - The program then prints `n - max(cn, ck)` as the minimum cost.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies if the array is already uniform and outputs `0` in such cases.
   - For non-uniform arrays, the program aims to find the longest segment of consecutive equal elements from the start and the end of the array.
   - The idea is to minimize the cost by covering the largest possible segment with a single operation.
   - However, the program does not consider the possibility of finding the most frequent element in the array and making all elements equal to that element, which could potentially be a cheaper operation.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program only considers the longest segment from the start and the end, but it does not check if making all elements equal to the most frequent element in the array could be a cheaper operation.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, the program will output `3` (by covering the middle segment), but the optimal solution would be to make all elements equal to `2`, which costs only `1` burle.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct because it does not consider the most frequent element in the array, which could lead to a suboptimal solution.
