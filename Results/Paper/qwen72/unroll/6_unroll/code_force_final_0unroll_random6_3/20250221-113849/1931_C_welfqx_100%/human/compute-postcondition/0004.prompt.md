You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) for the array a, with each element a_i satisfying 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for r in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        f = 1
        
        num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
        
        for j in range(n - 1):
            if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
                f = 0
                break
        
        if n == 1 or f == 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        onum = num.copy()
        
        onum.reverse()
        
        cn = 1
        
        ck = 1
        
        f = 1
        
        symb1 = num[0]
        
        symb2 = onum[0]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
                cn += 1
            else:
                break
        
        for ii in range(n - 1):
            if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
                ck += 1
            else:
                break
        
        if symb1 == symb2:
            cn += ck
        
        print(n - max(cn, ck))
        
    #State: The function will print the number of elements that need to be removed from each test case array to make it a palindrome, and the loop will complete all iterations for the given number of test cases `t`. The variables `r`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `onum`, `cn`, `ck`, `symb1`, and `symb2` will have their final values based on the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases and each inner list in `a` contains `n` integers. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the computation applied to the elements of the inner lists.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
