The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `a`, where each inner list represents a test case and contains `n` integers. The constraints are as follows:
- `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`
- Each inner list in `a` contains `n` integers, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`
- Each element `a_i` in the inner lists satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ n`
- The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed `2 · 10^5`

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in the input list `a`. The result for each test case is determined based on the specific logic or computation applied to the elements of the inner list.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases and each inner list in `a` contains `n` integers. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the computation applied to the elements of the inner lists.**
