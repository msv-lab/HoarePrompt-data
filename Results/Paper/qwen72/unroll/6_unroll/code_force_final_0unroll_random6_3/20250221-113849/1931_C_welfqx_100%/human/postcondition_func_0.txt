The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list to make it a palindrome and prints this number for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program reflects the final values of the variables based on the last test case processed.
