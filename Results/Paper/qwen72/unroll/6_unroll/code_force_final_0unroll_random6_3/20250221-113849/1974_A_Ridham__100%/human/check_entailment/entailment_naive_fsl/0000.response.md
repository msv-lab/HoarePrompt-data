Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons (x) is sufficient to fill the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons, but the placement of 1x1 icons is not optimal. For example, consider the test case where `x = 8` and `y = 2`. According to the problem, the minimum number of screens required should be 2, but the program calculates it as 3. This is because the program does not consider the possibility of placing 1x1 icons in the remaining spaces after placing 2x2 icons in a way that minimizes the number of screens. 

To illustrate, the optimal placement for `x = 8` and `y = 2` can be:
- Screen 1: 2x2 icon, 7 1x1 icons
- Screen 2: 2x2 icon, 1 1x1 icon

However, the program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons first, which is 2 screens, and then checks if the remaining space can accommodate the 1x1 icons. In this case, it incorrectly calculates that an additional screen is needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
