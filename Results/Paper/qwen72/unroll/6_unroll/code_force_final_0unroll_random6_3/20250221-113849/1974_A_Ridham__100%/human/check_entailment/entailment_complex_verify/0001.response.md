### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The initial state of the program is correctly described, and the input handling is accurate.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - It also calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - The total space required is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The space calculations are correct and match the problem description.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program determines the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the program calculates:
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even.
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
   - This is correct because each screen can hold at most 2 of the 2x2 icons (since 2 * 4 = 8 cells, and 15 cells are available per screen).
   - **Annotation Verification:** The calculation for the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is accurate.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This is correct because it subtracts the space occupied by the 2x2 icons from the total available cells on the screens required for the 2x2 icons.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The calculation for remaining cells is accurate.

5. **Handling 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all the 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), the program appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` calculates the space still needed for the 1x1 icons.
     - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15` calculates the number of full screens needed for the extra space.
     - If there is any remaining space after the full screens (`extra_space % 15 != 0`), it adds one more screen to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The handling of 1x1 icons is correct and follows the logic of the problem description.

6. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case, each on a new line.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The output format matches the problem description.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program assumes that the input is valid and within the specified range, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem constraints.
- The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and the remaining cells for 1x1 icons is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic to determine the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons. It handles both the 2x2 and 1x1 icons efficiently and correctly according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
