### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each case.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons as `space_x = x * 1`.
   - It calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons as `space_y = y * 4`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program determines the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. If the number of 2x2 icons is even (`y % 2 == 0`), it divides `y` by 2 to get the number of screens needed. If `y` is odd, it divides `y` by 2 and adds 1 to account for the extra screen needed for the last 2x2 icon.

4. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of cells available in the screens required for the 2x2 icons as `15 * screen_require_for_y`.
   - It then subtracts the space occupied by the 2x2 icons (`space_y`) from the total available space to get the remaining cells (`remaining_cells`).

5. **Space Calculation for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to accommodate all the 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), the program appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result list.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, it calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons. The additional space required is `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`. The number of additional screens is calculated as `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + (1 if extra_space % 15 != 0 else 0)`.
   - The total number of screens required is then the sum of the screens needed for the 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

6. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case, with each result on a new line.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem description. It also correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons, considering the constraints and the available space on each screen.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
