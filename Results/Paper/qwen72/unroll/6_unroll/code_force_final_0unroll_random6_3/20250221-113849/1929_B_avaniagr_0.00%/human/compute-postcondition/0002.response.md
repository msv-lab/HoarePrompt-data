The function `func` should accept two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).

Since the function output is not specified in the problem description, I will assume that the function returns a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to color the grid such that at least `k` diagonals contain at least one colored cell.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). It returns `True` if it is possible to color the grid to meet the condition, and `False` otherwise.**
