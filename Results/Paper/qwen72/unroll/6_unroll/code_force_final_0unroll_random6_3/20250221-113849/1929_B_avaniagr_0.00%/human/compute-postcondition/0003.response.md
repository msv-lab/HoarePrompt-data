Functionality: ** The function reads lines from the standard input, excluding the first line, and for each line, it extracts two integers `n` and `k`. It then calculates and prints a value based on the formula `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`. The function does not return any value, and the variables `n` and `k` are not retained after each iteration of the loop. The final state of the program is the printed output for each valid input line. **
