Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a "STAIR," "PEAK," or "NONE" based on the conditions provided in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case by reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. The conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` are correctly checked using if-elif-else statements, and the appropriate output is printed for each test case.

The program also handles the input and output format as specified in the problem description. It reads the inputs in the correct format and prints the results in the correct format. There are no logical errors or issues with the input/output handling.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
