### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements starting from the second element.
   - To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in increasing order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array are minimized, and the sum of these differences will be maximized when the array is sorted in increasing order.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array `a`.
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is already in strictly increasing order. If it is, the program prints `0` (since no rearrangement can increase the beauty).
   - If the array is not in strictly increasing order, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` checks if the array `a` is strictly increasing by iterating through the array and counting the number of times an element is not greater than the previous element.
   - If the array is strictly increasing, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Main Program Analysis:**
   - The main program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It uses `func_1` to check if the array is already in strictly increasing order.
   - If the array is not strictly increasing, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty.
   - The beauty is calculated by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `func_1` is not necessary for the problem. The maximum beauty is always achieved by sorting the array, regardless of whether it is already sorted or not.
   - The program should always sort the array and calculate the beauty, as sorting will always maximize the beauty.
   - The condition `if func_1(a, num2):` is redundant and can lead to incorrect results if the array is not strictly increasing but has a beauty greater than 0.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - The program should always sort the array and calculate the beauty, as this will always yield the maximum possible beauty.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses an unnecessary condition to check if the array is already sorted, which can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach is to always sort the array and calculate the beauty.

### Correctness:
**False**
