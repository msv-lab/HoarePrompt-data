### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num` and then iterates through each test case using a for loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a`.

2. **Function `func_1` Purpose:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is already in strictly increasing order.
   - If the array is in strictly increasing order, it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints `0` because the beauty of an already sorted array is `0`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array `a` and then summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

4. **Calculation of Maximum Beauty:**
   - The maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array in ascending order.
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array: \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`), which results in a beauty of `0`.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already in strictly increasing order, which also results in a beauty of `0`.

6. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the array is in strictly increasing order by comparing each element with the next one.
   - If the array is not in strictly increasing order, it returns `False`.

7. **Overall Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies when the array is already in strictly increasing order and prints `0`.
   - For arrays that are not in strictly increasing order, the program sorts the array and calculates the maximum beauty correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states. It correctly handles all test cases and edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
