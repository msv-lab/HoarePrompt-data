You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `num2`. It returns `True` if the first `num2 - 1` elements of the list `a` are in strictly increasing order, and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `num2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a` from the input.
   - The array elements are parsed correctly using a list comprehension that checks if each element is a digit.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
   - This function is used to determine if the array is already in a state where the beauty is zero (since no rearrangement can increase the beauty).

3. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints `0` because the array is already sorted and the beauty cannot be increased.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` for all `x` from 1 to `num2 - 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Analysis of the Solution:
- The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
- The maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array are minimized, and the sum of these differences is maximized.
- The function `func_1` is not necessary for the solution. It checks if the array is already sorted, but even if the array is sorted, the beauty calculation will still be correct and will yield `0` for a sorted array with all elements equal.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
- The sorting of the array and the calculation of the beauty are correct.
- The function `func_1` is redundant but does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in terms of solving the problem as described. However, the function `func_1` is unnecessary and can be removed to simplify the code.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
