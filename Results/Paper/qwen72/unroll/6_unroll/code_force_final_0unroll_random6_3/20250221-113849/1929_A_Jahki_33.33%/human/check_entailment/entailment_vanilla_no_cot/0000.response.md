Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the maximum beauty of the array. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and if it is, it prints `0`. However, this is not the correct approach to determine the maximum beauty of the array.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty of the array, you should sort the array in ascending order. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, starting from the second element. When the array is sorted, the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, and the sum of these differences is maximized.

### Corrected Program:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - Read the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, read the length of the array `num2` and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - Sort the array `a` to get `b`.

3. **Calculate Beauty:**
   - Initialize `beauty` to 0.
   - Iterate through the sorted array and calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Output:**
   - Print the calculated beauty for each test case.

This approach ensures that the beauty of the array is maximized, as the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array are the smallest possible.
