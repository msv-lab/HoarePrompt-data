### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a` from the input.
   - The array elements are parsed correctly using a list comprehension that checks if each element is a digit.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
   - The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `num2`.

3. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints `0` because the array is already sorted and the beauty cannot be increased.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` for all `x` from 1 to `num2 - 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Analysis of the Solution:
- The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
- The maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array are minimized, and the sum of these differences is maximized.
- The function `func_1` is not necessary for the solution. It checks if the array is already sorted, but even if the array is sorted, the beauty calculation will still be correct and will yield `0` for a sorted array with all elements equal.
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is redundant but does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
- The sorting of the array and the calculation of the beauty are correct.
- The function `func_1` is redundant but does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in terms of solving the problem as described. However, the function `func_1` is unnecessary and can be removed to simplify the code.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The original assessment was accurate in its evaluation of the program's correctness and the redundancy of the function `func_1`. Therefore, the final evaluation is **True**.
