The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter, which is a list of binary strings. Each string in the list has a length between 2 and 200,000 characters, and consists only of '0's and '1's. The sum of the lengths of all strings in the list does not exceed 200,000. The function returns a processed result based on the input list of binary strings.

Since the output is not specified in the provided information, I will describe the functionality based on the input parameters alone.
