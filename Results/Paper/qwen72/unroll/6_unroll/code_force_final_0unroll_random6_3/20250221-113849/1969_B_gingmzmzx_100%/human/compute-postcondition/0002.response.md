Output State: **The loop will execute `n` times, and for each iteration, it will read a binary string `s` from the input, convert it into a list of integers, and then compute and print the value of `ans` based on the number of '0's and '1's in the string. After all iterations, the loop will have printed `n` lines, each containing the computed value of `ans` for the corresponding binary string. The variables `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will be reset for each iteration, so their final values will be the ones from the last iteration.**
