You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, indicating the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `n` iterations, it reads a binary string `s` from the input, converts it into a list of integers, and computes a value `ans` based on the number of '0's and '1's in the string. The function then prints the computed value of `ans` for each binary string. After processing all `n` binary strings, the function will have printed `n` lines, each containing the computed value of `ans` for the corresponding binary string. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost.
   - A cyclic shift operation on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) costs \( r - l + 1 \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string \( s \).
   - It converts the string into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeroes in the string.
   - It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the minimum total cost.
   - It iterates through each character in the string:
     - If the character is 0, it increments the count of 0s in `cnt` and adds 1 to `ans` if there are any 1s before it.
     - If the character is 1, it increments the count of 1s in `cnt` and adds the number of remaining 0s to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the total cost `ans` for each test case.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly counts the number of 0s and 1s in the string.
   - The cost calculation is based on the idea that each 0 that appears after a 1 in the string needs to be moved to the front, and each 1 that appears before a 0 needs to be moved to the end.
   - The cost for moving a 0 to the front is 1 (since it can be done by a single cyclic shift of a substring of length 1).
   - The cost for moving a 1 to the end is the number of remaining 0s (since each 1 needs to be moved past all remaining 0s).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by correctly outputting 0.
   - It also handles the case where the string is not sorted (e.g., "101011") by correctly calculating the minimum cost.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity is \( O(n) \) for each test case, where \( n \) is the length of the string.
   - The space complexity is \( O(n) \) due to the list conversion of the string.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the algorithm to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem constraints.
