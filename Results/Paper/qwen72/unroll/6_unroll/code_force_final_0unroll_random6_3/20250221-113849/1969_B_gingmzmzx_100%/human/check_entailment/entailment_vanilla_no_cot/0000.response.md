Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes**: It counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores this count in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Tracking Counts and Cost**: It initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far in the string. It also initializes `ans` to store the total cost of the operations needed to sort the string.

4. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - For each character `c` in the string `s`, it updates the count of the current character in `cnt`.
   - If the character is `0` and there have been `1`s before it (`cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to `ans` because a cyclic shift is needed to move the `0` to its correct position.
   - If the character is `1`, it adds the difference between the total number of zeroes and the number of zeroes encountered so far (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`. This accounts for the cost of moving all remaining zeroes to the left of the current `1`.

5. **Output**: After processing each test case, it prints the total cost `ans`.

This approach correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order by considering the cost of moving each `0` to the left of any `1` and the cost of moving `1`s to the right of all `0`s. The program efficiently handles the constraints and produces the correct output for the given examples.
