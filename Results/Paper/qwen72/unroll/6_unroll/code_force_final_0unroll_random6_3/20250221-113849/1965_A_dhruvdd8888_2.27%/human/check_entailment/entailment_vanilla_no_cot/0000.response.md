Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `randint`**: The `randint(8888, 88888)` is unnecessary and does not contribute to the solution. It should be removed.

2. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called inside the loop, but it should be defined before the loop. The function definition should be moved above the loop.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Input**: The function `func_1()` reads input directly, which is not a good practice. It should take the input as parameters.

4. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The program checks if the number of unique pile sizes is 1 or 2 and prints "Alice" or "Bob" accordingly. This logic is incorrect.
   - The program then inserts a 0 at the beginning of the sorted list of unique pile sizes and checks for consecutive differences of 1. This logic is also incorrect and does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules.

### Correct Approach:

To determine the winner, we need to consider the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

Here is the correct implementation:

```python
def determine_winner(piles):
    odd_count = sum(1 for pile in piles if pile % 2 == 1)
    return "Alice" if odd_count % 2 == 1 else "Bob"

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(determine_winner(piles))
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:

1. **Count the Number of Piles with an Odd Number of Stones**:
   - If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, Alice can always win by making the first move that reduces the number of odd piles to an even number.
   - If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is even, Bob can always win by mirroring Alice's moves, ensuring that the number of odd piles remains even until Bob wins.

2. **Print the Winner**:
   - Based on the parity of the odd count, print "Alice" or "Bob".

This approach correctly determines the winner for each test case.
