Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the penalty based on the number of '-' characters in the string `s`, but it does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
+-+-+
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
For the input `+-+-+`, the array `a` is `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1]`. The optimal way to split this array to minimize the penalty is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1])`, which results in a penalty of `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`. However, the program calculates the penalty as `n - 2 * neg` where `n` is the length of the string and `neg` is the number of '-' characters. In this case, `n = 5` and `neg = 2`, so the program outputs `5 - 2 * 2 = 1`, which is incorrect.

The correct minimum penalty for this input should be `0`, as shown by the optimal split `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1])`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
