### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-".

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called `t` times, once for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads `n` and `s` for the current test case.
   - It initializes a variable `neg` to count the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The penalty is calculated using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n != neg`.
   - If `n == neg`, the penalty is simply `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated penalty for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Penalty Calculation:**
  - The penalty calculation is based on the idea that each '+' contributes 1 to the sum and each '-' contributes -1.
  - The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to split it such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
  - If `n == neg`, it means the string `s` consists entirely of '-' characters. In this case, the optimal split is to have each subarray contain exactly one '-' character, resulting in a penalty of `n` (since each subarray has a penalty of 1).
  - If `n != neg`, the program calculates the penalty as `n - 2 * neg`. This formula is derived from the fact that each '+' contributes 1 and each '-' contributes -1. The total sum of the array `a` is `n - 2 * neg` (since there are `n - neg` '+' characters and `neg` '-' characters). The optimal split is to have each subarray sum to zero, which is achieved by pairing each '-' with a '+'. The remaining characters (if any) will form subarrays with a sum of 1 or -1, and the penalty for these subarrays is minimized by the formula.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `n == neg` correctly by printing `n`.
  - The program also handles the case where `n != neg` correctly by printing `n - 2 * neg`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for the given problem. The logic and the formula used are appropriate for the problem description.
