To execute the provided Python code snippet, we need to consider the function call `func_2(r, l, ops)`. However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided, so we can only make assumptions based on the given initial state and the typical behavior of such functions. Assuming `func_2` modifies the `ops` list by appending the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` and then `[r + 1, r + 1]` as described, we can proceed with the following output state:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the parameters of an operation, and the last two elements of `ops` are `[r + 1, l + 1]` and `[r + 1, r + 1]`.**
