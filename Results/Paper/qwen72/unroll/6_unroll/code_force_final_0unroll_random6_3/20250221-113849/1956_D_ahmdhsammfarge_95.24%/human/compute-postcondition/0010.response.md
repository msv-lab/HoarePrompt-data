The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)`. `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the parameters of an operation. The function returns the list `lst` where the elements from index `r` to index `l` (inclusive) are all set to the value `n`, and `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`. The rest of the elements in `lst` remain unchanged.
