### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Purpose**: To find the optimal range `[r, l]` that maximizes the sum of the array after applying the operation.
   - **Flaw**: The function does not correctly compute the MEX value for the chosen range. Instead, it calculates a hypothetical sum by assuming that the MEX value for the range `[i, j]` is `(j - i + 1)`, which is the length of the range. This is incorrect because the MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the range, not necessarily the length of the range.
   - **Impact**: This flaw means that the function may not identify the correct range to maximize the sum, leading to suboptimal or incorrect results.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Purpose**: To recursively generate operations for the range `[r, l]`.
   - **Flaw**: The function generates operations in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements. It appends the same operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, which is unnecessary and does not contribute to maximizing the sum.
   - **Impact**: This function can lead to an excessive number of operations being generated, potentially exceeding the allowed limit of \(5 \cdot 10^5\) operations.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - **Purpose**: To apply the operation to the range `[r, l]` and update the list `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
   - **Flaw**: The function appends multiple operations to `ops` without a clear rationale. It also sets the elements in the range `[r, l]` to the length of the range, which is not the correct MEX value.
   - **Impact**: This function does not correctly apply the operation as described in the problem, leading to incorrect modifications of the array and operations list.

4. **Main Program**:
   - **Flaw**: The main program uses `func_1` to find the optimal range and then repeatedly applies `func_3` until `r` equals `l`. However, since `func_1` and `func_3` are flawed, the main program does not correctly maximize the sum of the array.
   - **Impact**: The program may produce incorrect results and an excessive number of operations.

### Specific Case Analysis:
- **Input**:
  ```
  4
  1 100 2 1
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  105 2
  3 3
  3 4
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  - The program will likely produce a different output because `func_1` does not correctly compute the MEX value. The operations generated by `func_3` and `func_2` are also incorrect, leading to an incorrect final array and sum.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution to maximize the sum of the elements of the array using the given operation. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are flawed and do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
