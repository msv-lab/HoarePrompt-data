Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly follows the problem description and handles the input and output as specified. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n` from the input. It then processes each test case by reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If true, it prints 'STAIR'.
   - It checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If true, it prints 'PEAK'.
   - If neither condition is true, it prints 'NONE'.

3. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case as specified in the problem description.

4. **Loop Index**: The loop index `i` is used to iterate through the test cases and is correctly set to `n-1` after the loop completes, which is expected behavior for a `for` loop.

5. **Variable Scope**: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are redefined for each test case within the loop, which is appropriate for the problem.

Given the execution summary and the problem description, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
