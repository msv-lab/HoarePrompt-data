Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, the function receives three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each digit is an integer such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, the function receives three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each digit is an integer such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. `n` is an input integer. After the loop executes all the iterations, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are undefined (as they are reassigned in each iteration), and `i` is equal to `n-1` (the last index of the loop). The loop will have printed 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each iteration based on the conditions provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `n` is provided as input. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9). It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are undefined. The loop index `i` is equal to `n-1` after the loop completes.
