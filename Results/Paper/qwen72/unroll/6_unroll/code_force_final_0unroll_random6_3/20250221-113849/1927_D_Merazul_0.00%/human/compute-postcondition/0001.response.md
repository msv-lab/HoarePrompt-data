The code snippet `t, = R()` reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first (and only) integer to the variable `t`. The function `R()` is assumed to return an iterator of integers from the input line.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case contains `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) in an array `a`, and `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5) queries.
- Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n).
- The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
- `R` is a function that reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and returns an iterator of those integers.

After executing the code snippet:
- `t` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input line.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input line, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) in an array `a`, and `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5) queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
