### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a sequence where the first \( k \) people are numbered \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \), followed by the next \( k-2 \) people numbered \( k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \), and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) fit the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) received by Vasya.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The sequence repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), \( k \) must satisfy the conditions of the sequence.
   - The sequence can be broken down into two parts:
     - The first part: \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \)
     - The second part: \( k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \)

3. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - For the first part, if \( n \) is in the range \( [1, k] \), then \( x \) should be \( n \).
   - For the second part, if \( n \) is in the range \( [k+1, 2k-2] \), then \( x \) should be \( 2k - n \).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to find all divisors of a given number \( x \).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - \( (n + x - 2) \) is even.
     - \( (n - x) \) is even.
   - For each condition, it finds the divisors and checks if they fit the constraints \( k > 1 \) and \( k \geq x \).

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of \( x \) in a specific order.
   - It correctly finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a list.

6. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic checks if \( (n + x - 2) \) and \( (n - x) \) are even.
   - If they are, it finds the divisors and checks if they fit the constraints.
   - It then appends the valid \( k \) values to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the unique values in `output`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( (n + x - 2) \) and \( (n - x) \).
- It checks the conditions for valid \( k \) values and ensures \( k > 1 \) and \( k \geq x \).
- The logic for finding the divisors and checking the conditions is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description and constraints.
