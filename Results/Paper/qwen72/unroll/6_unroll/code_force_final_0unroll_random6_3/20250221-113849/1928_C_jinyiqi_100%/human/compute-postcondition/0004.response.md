The code snippet `output1.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `output1`. The initial state specifies that `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`. After reversing, the elements in `output1` will be in the opposite order. The variable `x` remains unchanged, and `output2` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, `output2` contains their corresponding complementary divisors, and `x` remains unchanged.**
