### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, but it does not consider the case where `a` is even and `b` is odd. To determine if Bob can form another rectangle, we need to consider the following:

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size `a/2 \times b`.
   - If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size `a \times b/2`.

2. **Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - After cutting, Bob can rotate and move the resulting rectangles to form a new rectangle.
   - For example, if `a` is even, cutting the rectangle into two `a/2 \times b` rectangles allows Bob to form a new rectangle of size `a \times b/2` by placing the two smaller rectangles side by side.
   - Similarly, if `b` is even, cutting the rectangle into two `a \times b/2` rectangles allows Bob to form a new rectangle of size `a/2 \times b` by placing the two smaller rectangles side by side.

3. **Checking for Different Rectangles:**
   - The new rectangle formed should be different from the original rectangle. This means that the dimensions of the new rectangle should not be the same as the original rectangle, considering that rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90Â° rotation.
   - For example, from a `2 \times 6` rectangle, Bob can cut it into two `2 \times 3` rectangles and form a `4 \times 3` rectangle, which is different from the original `2 \times 6` rectangle.
   - However, from a `6 \times 3` rectangle, Bob can cut it into two `3 \times 3` rectangles and form a `3 \times 6` rectangle, which is considered the same as the original `6 \times 3` rectangle.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

The original assessment correctly points out that the program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even and does not consider the case where `a` is even and `b` is odd. For example, for the input `6 3`, the program will output "no" because `b` is odd, but Bob can actually form another rectangle by cutting the `6x3` rectangle into two `3x3` rectangles and then forming a `3x6` rectangle, which is considered the same as the original `6x3` rectangle.

### Correct Solution:

To correctly solve the problem, the function should check if either `a` or `b` is even. If either dimension is even, Bob can form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The given program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly. The function `func_1` should check if either `a` or `b` is even, not just `b`.

Final: **False**
