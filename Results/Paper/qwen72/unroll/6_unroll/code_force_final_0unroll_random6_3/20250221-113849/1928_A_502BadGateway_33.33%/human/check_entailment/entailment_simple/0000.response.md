Reasoning:  
The program's logic is based on the condition that the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reformed into a different rectangle. The key observation is that if one of the sides of the original rectangle is even, then it can be cut into two equal parts, and these parts can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original, considering the problem's rule that rectangles differing only by a 90Â° rotation are considered the same.

However, the provided program only checks if `b` is even. This is not sufficient because the condition should apply to either `a` or `b`. For example, a 6x2 rectangle can also be cut into two 3x2 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 3x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 6x2 rectangle. Therefore, the program should return 'yes' if either `a` or `b` is even, not just `b`.

Given this, the program is incorrect because it does not account for the case where `a` is even and `b` is odd, or both are even, which would still allow Bob to form a different rectangle.

Correctness: **False**
