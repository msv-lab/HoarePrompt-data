Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating a threshold value `s` that Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee that he can reach any number of coins. However, the logic used to calculate `s` is flawed and does not correctly reflect the conditions of the problem.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `s`:**
   - The program calculates `s` by starting with `s = 1` and then iteratively adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` for `x` times. This calculation is incorrect because it does not properly account for the fact that Sasha can lose up to `x` times in a row and still recover.
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure that he can recover from `x` consecutive losses and still have at least one coin left to bet. This can be done by considering the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins once.

2. **Worst-Case Scenario:**
   - In the worst-case scenario, Sasha loses `x` times in a row. After `x` losses, he will have `a - y * x` coins left, where `y` is the bet amount. To ensure that he can recover, he should have enough coins to place a bet that, when won, will bring his total back to at least `a` coins.
   - The correct threshold should be calculated as `s = y * (k - 1) + y * x`, where `y` is the smallest bet amount that allows Sasha to recover from `x` consecutive losses.

3. **Bet Amount Strategy:**
   - The program does not consider the optimal bet amount strategy. Sasha should start with the smallest possible bet and increase it in a way that ensures he can recover from `x` consecutive losses.

### Correct Approach:

To determine if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins, we need to check if he can recover from `x` consecutive losses and still have enough coins to continue betting. The correct threshold `s` should be calculated as follows:

- Sasha starts with `a` coins.
- After `x` consecutive losses, he will have `a - y * x` coins left.
- To recover, he needs to have at least `y * (k - 1)` coins left after `x` losses, so he can place a bet that will bring his total back to at least `a` coins.
- Therefore, the correct threshold `s` should be `y * (k - 1) + y * x`, where `y` is the smallest bet amount that allows recovery.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        y = 1
        s = y * (k - 1) + y * x
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the threshold `s` and checks if Sasha's initial number of coins `a` is sufficient to guarantee that he can win any number of coins.
