The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input. It then calculates a value `s` starting from 1 and updates it in a loop that runs `x` times. The loop increments `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration. After the loop, the function prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, and the output for each test case is either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison.
