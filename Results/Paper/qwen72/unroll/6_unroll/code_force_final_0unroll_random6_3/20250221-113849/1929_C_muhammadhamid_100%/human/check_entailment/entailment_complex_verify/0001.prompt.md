You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES

    YES

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, k, x, and a are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
        
    #State: The value of `t` is unchanged, and for each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are unchanged. The variable `s` is updated to the final value calculated by the loop, and the output for each test case is 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `s`, otherwise 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input. It then calculates a value `s` starting from 1 and updates it in a loop that runs `x` times. The loop increments `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration. After the loop, the function prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, and the output for each test case is either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha wants to determine if he can place bets in such a way that he is guaranteed to have at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.
   - The casino rules are:
     - If he wins a bet of `y` coins, he gets `y * k` coins.
     - If he loses a bet of `y` coins, he loses `y` coins.
     - He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - Initially, Sasha has `a` coins.

2. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - To guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins, he needs to ensure that even after the maximum number of consecutive losses (`x` times), he still has enough coins to continue betting.
   - The key is to determine the minimum number of coins `s` that Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can always recover from `x` consecutive losses.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - If Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he will lose `y + y + ... + y` (x times) coins, which is `x * y` coins.
   - To recover from these losses, he needs to win at least once to gain `y * (k - 1)` coins.
   - The minimum bet `y` should be 1 to minimize the initial requirement.
   - After `x` consecutive losses, Sasha needs to have at least `x + 1` coins to place a bet of 1 coin and still have 1 coin left after the loss.

4. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program initializes `s` to 1, which is the minimum number of coins needed to start.
   - It then iterates `x` times, each time increasing `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1`.
     - `s // (k - 1)` represents the number of coins Sasha can win back from a single win.
     - Adding 1 ensures that Sasha can place a bet of 1 coin even after `x` consecutive losses.
   - After the loop, `s` represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to guarantee he can always recover from `x` consecutive losses.
   - If `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`, then Sasha can achieve any number of coins, and the program outputs "Yes". Otherwise, it outputs "No".

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins `s` needed to start with.
   - The logic of incrementing `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration ensures that Sasha can always recover from `x` consecutive losses.
   - The comparison `a >= s` correctly determines if Sasha can achieve any number of coins.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can guarantee having at least `n` coins for any integer `n` based on the given rules and constraints.
