Reasoning:

The program aims to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program reads the input and processes each test case by:
1. Creating a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array `arr`.
2. For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` to zero.
3. It then creates two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of elements based on their remainders when divided by \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.
4. It iterates through the array `arr` and for each element `num`:
   - It calculates the remainders `mod_x` and `mod_y` for \(-num\) and `num` respectively.
   - It adds the counts of elements that, when added to `num`, would result in a sum divisible by \(x\) and a difference divisible by \(y\) to `count`.
   - It updates the dictionaries with the remainders of `num` when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).

However, there is a logical error in the program:
- The condition for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful is that both \(a_i + a_j\) and \(a_i - a_j\) must be divisible by \(x\) and \(y\) respectively.
- The current implementation only checks if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\) for pairs where \(i < j\), but it does not ensure that both conditions are met simultaneously for the same pair.

To fix this, the program should:
- Check if both conditions are met simultaneously for each pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\).
- This can be done by iterating through the array and for each element `num`, checking the conditions with all subsequent elements.

Given the current implementation, the program will not correctly count the beautiful pairs as defined in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
