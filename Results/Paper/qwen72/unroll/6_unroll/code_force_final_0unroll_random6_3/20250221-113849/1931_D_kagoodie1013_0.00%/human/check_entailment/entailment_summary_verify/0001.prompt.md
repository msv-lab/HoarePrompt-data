You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing a list of integers `arr` and two integers `x` and `y`. It returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the count of pairs (i, j) in the respective test case's `arr` such that i < j and the sum (arr[i] + arr[j]) is divisible by `x` or `y`. The input `test_cases` list remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case.
   - This approach is efficient and appropriate for the given input format.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program extracts the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It initializes a `count` variable to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It also initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to store the counts of remainders when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

3. **Loop Through Array**:
   - The program iterates through each element `num` in the array `arr`.
   - For each `num`, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`:
     - `mod_x` is calculated as `-num % x`. This is because for `a_i + a_j` to be divisible by `x`, `a_i` and `a_j` must have the same remainder when negated and taken modulo `x`.
     - `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`. This is because for `a_i - a_j` to be divisible by `y`, `a_i` and `a_j` must have the same remainder when taken modulo `y`.
   - It then adds the counts of these remainders from the dictionaries to `count`:
     - `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` gives the count of elements in `arr` that have the same `mod_x` remainder.
     - `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` gives the count of elements in `arr` that have the same `mod_y` remainder.
   - It updates the dictionaries with the current element's remainders:
     - `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.
     - `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.
     - The counts of these remainders are incremented in the respective dictionaries.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in `arr`, the program appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

5. **Logical Errors**:
   - The program correctly calculates the remainders and updates the dictionaries.
   - However, there is a logical error in the way the program counts the beautiful pairs. The current implementation counts pairs where `a_i` and `a_j` have the same remainder when divided by `x` and `y`, but it does not ensure that `i < j`.

6. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly count the beautiful pairs, we need to ensure that each pair is counted only once and that `i < j`.
   - The current implementation counts each pair twice (once for `a_i` and once for `a_j`), and it does not check the order of indices.

Given the logical error in the way pairs are counted, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
