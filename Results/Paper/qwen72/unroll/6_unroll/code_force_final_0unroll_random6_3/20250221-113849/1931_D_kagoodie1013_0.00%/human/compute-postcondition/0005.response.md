Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing a list of integers `arr` and two integers `x` and `y`. It returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the count of pairs (i, j) in the respective test case's `arr` such that i < j and the sum (arr[i] + arr[j]) is divisible by `x` or `y`. The input `test_cases` list remains unchanged. **
