Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it counts the beautiful pairs. Specifically, the logic for counting pairs where both conditions are satisfied simultaneously is incorrect. The program is currently counting pairs based on the individual conditions for `a_i + a_j` being divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` being divisible by `y`, but it does not ensure that both conditions are met for the same pair of indices `(i, j)`.

To correctly count the beautiful pairs, you need to ensure that for each pair `(i, j)` where `i < j`, both conditions are satisfied:
1. `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))

results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (arr[i] + arr[j]) % x == 0 and (arr[i] - arr[j]) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This version iterates through all possible pairs `(i, j)` and checks both conditions for each pair, ensuring that only pairs that satisfy both conditions are counted. This approach, while straightforward, may not be the most efficient for large inputs, but it correctly implements the logic described in the problem.
