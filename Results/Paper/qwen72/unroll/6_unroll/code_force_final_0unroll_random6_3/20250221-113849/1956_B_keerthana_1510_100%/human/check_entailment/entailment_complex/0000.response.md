Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The function `func` reads input from the standard input and processes each test case, but it only counts the number of duplicate card values in the list `a` for each test case. This is not the correct approach to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, as it does not consider the strategic play of Nene or the sequence of turns.

The problem requires a more complex algorithm to simulate the game and determine the optimal strategy for both players. Specifically, the function should:
1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases `t`, the number of cards `n`, and the list of cards `a` for each test case.
2. For each test case, determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, considering that Nene will always play to maximize her score and minimize yours.

The current implementation simply counts the number of duplicates in the list `a`, which is not sufficient to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
