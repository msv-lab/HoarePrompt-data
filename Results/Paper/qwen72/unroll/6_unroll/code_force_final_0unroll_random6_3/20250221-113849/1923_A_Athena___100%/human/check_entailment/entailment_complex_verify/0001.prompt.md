You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) indicating the state of each cell. Each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip (a_i = 1).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The variable `t` is unchanged, and for each test case, the variable `res` holds the number of zeros between the first and last occurrence of a chip (`1`) in the list `a`. The list `a` is modified to only contain the elements between the first and last chip, inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) from the input. The function then processes each test case to count the number of zeros between the first and last occurrence of a chip (1) in the list. It prints this count for each test case. The function does not return any value. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list `a` is modified to only contain the elements between the first and last chip, inclusive, for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cells.

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros**: The program trims leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`. This is a crucial step because:
   - Leading zeros do not affect the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.
   - Trailing zeros also do not affect the minimum number of operations because they are to the right of the last chip.

3. **Counting Zeros in the Trimmed List**: After trimming, the program counts the number of zeros in the remaining list `a`. The idea here is that each zero represents a gap between chips that needs to be filled by moving chips to the left.

4. **Output**: The program prints the count of zeros, which is the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

Let's break down the reasoning with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - After trimming leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
  - Zeros in the trimmed list: 1
  - Minimum operations: 1 (move the chip from position 5 to position 4)

- **Example 2**: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - After trimming leading and trailing zeros: `1`
  - Zeros in the trimmed list: 0
  - Minimum operations: 0 (all chips are already in a single block)

- **Example 3**: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - After trimming leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Zeros in the trimmed list: 0
  - Minimum operations: 0 (all chips are already in a single block)

- **Example 4**: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - After trimming leading and trailing zeros: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - Zeros in the trimmed list: 2
  - Minimum operations: 2 (move the chips from positions 3 and 5 to positions 2 and 4)

- **Example 5**: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - After trimming leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
  - Zeros in the trimmed list: 3
  - Minimum operations: 3 (move the chips from positions 6, 7, and 8 to positions 3, 4, and 5)

The program's logic is sound and matches the problem's requirements. It correctly identifies the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips by counting the gaps (zeros) between the chips in the trimmed list.
