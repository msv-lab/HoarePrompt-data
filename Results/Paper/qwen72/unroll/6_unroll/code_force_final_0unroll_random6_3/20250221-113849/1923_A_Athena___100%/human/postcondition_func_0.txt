The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) from the input. The function then processes each test case to count the number of zeros between the first and last occurrence of a chip (1) in the list. It prints this count for each test case. The function does not return any value. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list `a` is modified to only contain the elements between the first and last chip, inclusive, for each test case.
