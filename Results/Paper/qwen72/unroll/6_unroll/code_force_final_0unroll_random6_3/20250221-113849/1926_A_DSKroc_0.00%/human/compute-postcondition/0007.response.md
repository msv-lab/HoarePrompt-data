Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive. `ac` and `bc` are both 0. The function `func` has read `t` lines from stdin, each containing a distinct string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. After the if-else block, if `ac` is greater than `bc`, the current value of `ac` remains greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is not greater than `bc`.***
