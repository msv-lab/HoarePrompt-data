Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it does not print the result for each test case individually. The `if ac > bc:` and `else:` blocks are outside the loop that iterates over the test cases. This means that the program will only print the result for the last test case after processing all the test cases. To fix this, the `if ac > bc:` and `else:` blocks should be indented to be inside the loop that iterates over the test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```

This version will correctly print the result for each test case as required.
