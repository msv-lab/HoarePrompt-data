Reasoning:  
The provided program checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by only considering the second-to-last character in the string `b` (i.e., `b[n-2]`). This approach is incorrect because it does not fully consider the movement rules and the interactions between the arrows in both rows.

To correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), we need to simulate the robot's movement according to the given rules:

1. The robot starts at (1, 1).
2. Every second, the robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

The program should check if the robot can navigate through the grid to reach (2, n) without getting stuck or moving outside the grid. The current implementation only checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row points to the left, which is not sufficient to determine the robot's ability to reach the target cell.

For example, consider the test case:
```
4
>><<
>>><
```
The program will print 'No' because `b[2]` (i.e., the third character in `b`) is '<'. However, the robot can still reach (2, 4) by following the path:
```
(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4)
```
This shows that the program's logic is flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the robot's movement through the grid and check if it can reach (2, n).

Correctness: **False**
