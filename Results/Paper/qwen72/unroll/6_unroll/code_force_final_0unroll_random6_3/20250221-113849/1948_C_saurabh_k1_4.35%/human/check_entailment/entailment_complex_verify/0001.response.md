### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves in two steps each second: first, it moves left, right, down, or up; then it follows the arrow in the current cell.
   - The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and each cell contains an arrow pointing either left (<) or right (>).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The robot must eventually move to the second row to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot can only move to the second row by moving down from the first row.
   - Once in the second row, the robot must move right to reach the end column n.
   - The robot can only reach cell (2, n) if it can move to the second row and then move right to the end.
   - Specifically, the robot must be able to move to the second row at some column \( i \) where \( 1 \le i < n \).
   - If the robot moves to the second row and finds an arrow pointing left (<) at column \( n-1 \), it will be unable to move to column \( n \).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size \( n \), the first row \( a \), and the second row \( b \).
   - The program checks if the arrow at column \( n-1 \) in the second row \( b \) is pointing left (<).
   - If it is, the program prints "No" because the robot cannot move to column \( n \) from column \( n-1 \).
   - If it is not, the program prints "Yes" because the robot can move to column \( n \) from column \( n-1 \).

4. **Edge Cases and General Validity**:
   - The program assumes that \( n \) is even and that the sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \), as per the problem constraints.
   - The program does not check if the robot can actually move to the second row from the first row. However, the problem guarantees that the robot can always move to the second row at some point, so this is not a concern.
   - The program correctly identifies that if the arrow at \( b[n-2] \) is "<", the robot cannot reach \( (2, n) \).

5. **Critical Flaw**:
   - The program checks the condition `b[n - 2] == '<'` to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n). However, this is incorrect because the robot needs to check the arrow at column \( n-1 \) (i.e., `b[n - 1]`), not column \( n-2 \).
   - The correct condition should be `b[n - 1] == '<'`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it checks the wrong column for the critical condition. It should check the arrow at column \( n-1 \) in the second row, not column \( n-2 \).

Final: **False**
