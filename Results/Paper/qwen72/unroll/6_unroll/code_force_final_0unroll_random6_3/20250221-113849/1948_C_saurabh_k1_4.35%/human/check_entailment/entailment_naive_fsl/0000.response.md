Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) points to the right (`'>'`). However, this is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
><<<
><<<
```
In this case, the robot starts at `(1, 1)` and the arrows are:
- First row: `><<<`
- Second row: `><<<`

The robot's movements would be:
1. Move right to `(1, 2)`.
2. Follow the arrow to `(2, 2)`.
3. Move right to `(2, 3)`.
4. Follow the arrow to `(1, 3)`.
5. Move right to `(1, 4)`.
6. Follow the arrow to `(2, 4)`.

The robot can reach the cell `(2, 4)`, but the program will output `No` because `b[n - 2]` (which is `b[2]` in this case) is `<`. This is incorrect, and thus the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
