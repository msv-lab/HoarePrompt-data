The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other states provided (t, n, and the list of tuples) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
