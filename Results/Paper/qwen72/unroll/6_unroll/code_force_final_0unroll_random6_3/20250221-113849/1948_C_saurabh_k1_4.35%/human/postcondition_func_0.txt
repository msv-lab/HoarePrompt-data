The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. It then checks if the second-to-last character in the string `b` is '<'. If it is, the function prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are reset for each test case, and their values are not retained between iterations.
