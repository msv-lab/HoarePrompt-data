Reasoning:

1. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - It reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - This part of the program is correct as it correctly handles the input for multiple test cases.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - It reads a binary string `s` from the input, converting it into a list of integers.
   - It initializes `n` to 0, which will keep track of the number of 1s encountered.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost to sort the string.
   - The function iterates over the list `s`:
     - If the current character is 1, it increments `n`.
     - If the current character is 0 and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm aims to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order.
   - The cost is calculated based on the number of 1s encountered before each 0. For each 0 encountered after a 1, the cost is `n + 1`, where `n` is the count of 1s seen so far.
   - This approach is correct because:
     - Each 0 encountered after a 1 indicates that a cyclic shift is needed to move the 1s to the left of the 0s.
     - The cost of each shift is the length of the substring being shifted, which is `n + 1` (the 0 plus the `n` 1s).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000"), the function correctly prints 0.
   - If the string has no 0s (e.g., "1111"), the function correctly prints 0 because no shifts are needed.
   - If the string has no 1s (e.g., "0000"), the function correctly prints 0 because no shifts are needed.

5. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then reading each binary string for each test case.
   - The output for each test case is printed correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
