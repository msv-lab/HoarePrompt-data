Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here's the analysis:

1. **Case \( k = n \)**:
   - The program correctly outputs an array of all 1s, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this array will be sorted.

2. **Case \( k = 1 \)**:
   - The program outputs a range of numbers from 0 to \( n-1 \). This is incorrect because the elements of the array must be between 1 and \( 10^9 \). Additionally, the range of numbers from 0 to \( n-1 \) does not necessarily ensure that exactly one cyclic shift is sorted. For example, if \( n = 3 \), the output `[0, 1, 2]` is not valid because the elements should be between 1 and \( 10^9 \).

3. **Case \( k \neq 1 \) and \( k \neq n \)**:
   - The program outputs `-1` for all other cases. This is incorrect because there can be valid arrays for \( k \) values other than 1 or \( n \). For example, for \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \), a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should handle all cases properly, including generating valid arrays for \( k \) values other than 1 or \( n \). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == n:
            res = [1] * n
        elif k == 1:
            res = list(range(1, n + 1))
        elif k > 1:
            res = [1] * (n - k + 1) + list(range(2, k + 1))
        else:
            res = [-1]
        print(*res)

func()
```

This corrected program:
- Handles the case \( k = n \) by outputting an array of all 1s.
- Handles the case \( k = 1 \) by outputting a strictly increasing sequence from 1 to \( n \).
- Handles the case \( k > 1 \) by creating an array with \( n - k + 1 \) ones followed by a strictly increasing sequence from 2 to \( k \), ensuring exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts.
- Outputs `-1` for invalid cases (though the problem guarantees valid inputs, this is a safeguard).
