### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^3`.

2. **Logic for Generating the Array**:
   - **Case 1: `k == n`**:
     - If `k` equals `n`, the array must be sorted in all its cyclic shifts. This is only possible if all elements in the array are the same. Hence, the function generates an array of `n` ones, which is correct.
   - **Case 2: `k == 1`**:
     - If `k` equals 1, the array must have exactly one sorted cyclic shift. This can be achieved by creating an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order except for one element that is out of place. The function generates a range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, which is correct because the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is sorted, and any other cyclic shift will not be sorted.
   - **Case 3: `k != 1` and `k != n`**:
     - If `k` is neither 1 nor `n`, it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for any array of length `n`. This is because:
       - If `k > 1`, the array must have more than one sorted cyclic shift, which is not possible with the constraints given (since having more than one sorted cyclic shift implies a pattern that would make more than `k` shifts sorted).
       - If `k < n` and `k > 1`, the array must have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts, which is not feasible with the constraints.
     - Therefore, the function correctly outputs `-1` for this case.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is either a list of `n` ones, a range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, or `-1` based on the logic described above.
