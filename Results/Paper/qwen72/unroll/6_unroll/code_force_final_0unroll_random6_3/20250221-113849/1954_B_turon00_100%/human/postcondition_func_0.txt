The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of consecutive elements in `a` that are the same as the first element of `a`. If the list `a` has only one element or all elements are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the calculated minimum number. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the state of the program is such that all input has been consumed and the results have been printed.
