The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take the values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n
- The array `a` is beautiful in every test case
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` to ensure it is at least 1. The placeholder `_` does not need to be adjusted, but it will start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0**
