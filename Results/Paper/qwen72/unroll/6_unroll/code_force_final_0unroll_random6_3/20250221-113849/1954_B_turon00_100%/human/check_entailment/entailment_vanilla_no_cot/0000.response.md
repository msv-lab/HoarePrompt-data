Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the function `func()` is attempting to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same, which is not the correct approach for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider the following:

1. If the array has only one element, it cannot be made non-beautiful, so the answer is `-1`.
2. If all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, so the answer is `-1`.
3. For other cases, you need to find the minimum number of elements to remove such that no more operations can be applied to make all elements the same. This involves checking the structure of the array and ensuring that there are no indices `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) where `a[i-1] = a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.

The provided solution does not handle these cases correctly. Specifically, it does not check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements, and it incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same is the answer.

A correct approach would involve more sophisticated logic to ensure that the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. Here is a more correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # If the array has only one element, it cannot be made non-beautiful
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # If all elements are the same, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful
        if len(set(a)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Initialize the answer to the length of the array
        ans = n
        
        # Check for the minimum number of elements to remove
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i-1] == a[i+1]:
                ans = min(ans, n - (i - 1 + (n - i - 1) + 1))
        
        # If no such index is found, the array is already non-beautiful
        if ans == n:
            print(0)
        else:
            print(ans)

# Example usage
func()
```

This implementation correctly handles the cases where the array has only one element or all elements are the same. It also checks for the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure that no more operations can be applied to make the array beautiful.
