### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - An array is "beautiful" if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) where \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful, or output -1 if it's impossible.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself \( a \).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and `cnt` to count the number of consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - It iterates through the array, counting the length of each segment of consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - It updates `ans` with the minimum length of these segments.
   - After the loop, it checks if the entire array is a single segment of the same element (i.e., `ans == n`).
   - If the array has only one element or if the entire array is a single segment of the same element, it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum segment length `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The program correctly handles this case by printing -1.
   - **Array with All Elements the Same**: The program correctly handles this case by printing -1.
   - **Array with Multiple Segments**: The program correctly finds the minimum segment length and prints it.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The program runs in \( O(n) \) time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

6. **Critical Analysis**:
   - The program's logic is based on finding the minimum length of consecutive segments that are equal to the first element of the array.
   - However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful, not just the minimum length of consecutive segments.
   - The current logic does not account for the possibility that the array might become non-beautiful by removing elements that are not part of the first element's segment.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The program will output 1, which is correct. But for the array `[1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]`, the program will output 1, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 2 because removing the two middle 2s will make the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, which is non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. It fails to consider the broader context of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements that are not necessarily part of the first element's segment.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
