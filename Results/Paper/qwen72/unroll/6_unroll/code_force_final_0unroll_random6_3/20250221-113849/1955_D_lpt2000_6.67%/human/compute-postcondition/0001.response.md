To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `_` and `nabors`. The loop will execute if `nabors` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function definition.
- The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `nabors` is an input integer.

To ensure the loop executes, `nabors` must be greater than 0. The other parameters and conditions mentioned in the problem description do not directly affect the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0**
