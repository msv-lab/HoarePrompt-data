The code snippet `nabors = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `nabors`. This means `nabors` will hold an integer value provided by the user. The initial state mentions the function `func` and the conditions it should satisfy, but the code snippet does not affect these conditions directly. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `nabors` and the unchanged conditions of the function.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of elements in array `a`), `m` (an integer representing the number of elements in array `b`), and `k` (an integer representing the required number of matching elements), followed by two lists `a` and `b` of integers. The parameters should satisfy the conditions: 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all i, and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6 for all i. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `nabors` is an input integer.**
