Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i] + ans[i]` correctly. Specifically, the condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]` and the subsequent while loop can lead to an infinite loop if `ans[i + 1]` is exactly equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Example Input:
```
1
3
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2 3 4
```

Actual Output:
The program will enter an infinite loop because `ans[1]` will be set to `1 + 2 = 3`, and then the condition `ans[1] <= arr[1]` will be true, causing the while loop to run indefinitely.

To fix this, the condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]` should be changed to `if ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`, and the while loop should be adjusted accordingly to avoid infinite loops.
