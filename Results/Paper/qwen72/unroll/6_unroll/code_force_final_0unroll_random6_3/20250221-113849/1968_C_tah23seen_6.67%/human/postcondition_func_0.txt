The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of `n` elements where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `1 <= i < n-1`) is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be obtained by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `arr[i]`, and the last element `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
