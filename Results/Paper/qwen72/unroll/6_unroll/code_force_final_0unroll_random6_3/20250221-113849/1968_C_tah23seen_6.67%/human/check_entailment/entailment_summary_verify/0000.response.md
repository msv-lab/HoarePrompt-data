### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function `func_1` based on the provided function summary and the original assessment.

#### Function Summary:
- `func_1` takes a list `arr` and an integer `n`.
- It initializes `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0.
- The first element `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`.
- For each subsequent element `ans[i]` (where `1 <= i < n-1`), it sets `ans[i]` to `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]` and then ensures that `ans[i]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i]` by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `ans[i]` until this condition is met.
- The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program can enter an infinite loop if `ans[i + 1]` is exactly equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
- This is due to the condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]` and the subsequent while loop.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Initialization and First Element:**
   - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` ensures that `ans[0]` is always greater than `arr[0]`.

2. **Subsequent Elements:**
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is set to `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`.
   - The condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]` checks if `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, the while loop `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` increments `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.

3. **Potential Infinite Loop:**
   - The original assessment points out that if `ans[i + 1]` is exactly equal to `arr[i + 1]`, the while loop `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` will run indefinitely.
   - This is because the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` will always be true, and `ans[i + 1]` will keep increasing by `ans[i]` without ever breaking the loop.

4. **Correct Condition:**
   - The correct condition should be `if ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` to ensure that the loop breaks when `ans[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

5. **Example Input:**
   - For the input `1 3 1 1`, the program will:
     - Set `ans[0] = 1 + 1 = 2`.
     - Set `ans[1] = 1 + 2 = 3`.
     - Check `if ans[1] < arr[1]` (which is `3 < 1`), this condition is false, so the while loop is not entered.
     - Set `ans[2] = 3 + 1 = 4`.
     - The final output is `2 3 4`, which is correct.

6. **Infinite Loop Example:**
   - For the input `1 3 1 1`, the program will:
     - Set `ans[0] = 1 + 1 = 2`.
     - Set `ans[1] = 1 + 2 = 3`.
     - Check `if ans[1] < arr[1]` (which is `3 < 1`), this condition is false, so the while loop is not entered.
     - Set `ans[2] = 3 + 1 = 4`.
     - The final output is `2 3 4`, which is correct.
   - However, if we change the input to `1 3 1 3`, the program will:
     - Set `ans[0] = 1 + 1 = 2`.
     - Set `ans[1] = 1 + 2 = 3`.
     - Check `if ans[1] < arr[1]` (which is `3 < 3`), this condition is false, so the while loop is not entered.
     - Set `ans[2] = 3 + 3 = 6`.
     - The final output is `2 3 6`, which is incorrect because `6 % 3` should be `0`, not `3`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program can indeed enter an infinite loop if `ans[i + 1]` is exactly equal to `arr[i + 1]`. The condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]` should be changed to `if ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` to avoid this issue.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
