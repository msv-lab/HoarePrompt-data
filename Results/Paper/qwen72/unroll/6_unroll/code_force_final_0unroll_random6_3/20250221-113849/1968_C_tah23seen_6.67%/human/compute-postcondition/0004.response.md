The code snippet `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]` updates the last element of the list `ans` to be the sum of the second-to-last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is a list of `n` elements.
- `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
- For each `1 <= i < n`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be obtained by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `arr[i-1]`.

The code updates `ans[-1]` (the last element of `ans`) to be `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

Output State: **`ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `1 <= i < n-1`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be obtained by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `arr[i-1]`. The last element `ans[-1]` is now `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
