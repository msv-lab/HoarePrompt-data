Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `1 <= i < n-1`) is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be obtained by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `arr[i-1]`, and the last element `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
