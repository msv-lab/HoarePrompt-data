### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` of length `n-1`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.

3. **First Element:**
   - The first element of `ans` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `a_2 % a_1 = arr[0]` because `a_2` will be `arr[0] + a_1`.

4. **Subsequent Elements:**
   - For each subsequent element `i` from 1 to `n-2`, the program sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - It then checks if `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`. If it is, it repeatedly adds `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that `a_{i+2} % a_{i+1} = arr[i + 1]`.

5. **Last Element:**
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = arr[-1]`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
- The logic ensures that for each `i` from 2 to `n`, `ans[i] % ans[i-1] = arr[i-1]`.
- The while loop in the function `func_1` ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is always greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, which is necessary to satisfy the modulo condition.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and satisfies the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
