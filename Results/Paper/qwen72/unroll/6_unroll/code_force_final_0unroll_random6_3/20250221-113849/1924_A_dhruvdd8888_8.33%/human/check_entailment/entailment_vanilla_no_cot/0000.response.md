Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called within the loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` before it is defined. This will result in a `NameError` because the function is not yet defined when it is called.

2. **Incorrect Subsequence Checking**: The program attempts to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets by using a sliding window approach. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly check all possible subsequences of length `n`.

3. **Incorrect Use of `win` Set**: The `win` set is used to track characters in the current window, but it is cleared once it reaches `k` unique characters. This does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are checked. Instead, it only ensures that a certain number of unique characters are present in the window, which is not the same as checking all possible subsequences.

4. **Incorrect Output for "NO" Case**: The program generates a string to print in the "NO" case by appending characters to `ans` and then adding a missing character and padding with 'a'. This approach does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, you need to:

1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the string.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(x, s):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    alphabets = [chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)]
    all_possible_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabets, repeat=n)]
    
    for possible_string in all_possible_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(possible_string, s):
            print('NO')
            print(possible_string)
            return
    print('YES')

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Generate All Possible Strings**: The `product` function from the `itertools` module is used to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. **Check Subsequence**: The `is_subsequence` function checks if a given string `x` is a subsequence of `s` by using an iterator and the `all` function.
3. **Test Each String**: For each test case, the program checks if each possible string is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not a subsequence, it prints "NO" and the string. If all strings are subsequences, it prints "YES".

This approach ensures that the program correctly checks all possible strings and handles the "NO" case appropriately.
