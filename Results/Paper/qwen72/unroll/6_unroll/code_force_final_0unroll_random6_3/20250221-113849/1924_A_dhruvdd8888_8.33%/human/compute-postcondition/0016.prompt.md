You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: n, k, and s. n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each complete set of the first `k` alphabets encountered in `s`, `ps` is the number of times a complete set of the first `k` alphabets was encountered in `s`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each complete set of the first `k` alphabets encountered in `s`, `ps` is the number of times a complete set of the first `k` alphabets was encountered in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: - The `print` statement will always output the string `'NO'`.
    #
    #Output:
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: The loop prints a string for each character in the set `us` that is not in `win`. Each string is composed of the characters in `ans` concatenated with the current character from `us` and then padded with 'a' characters to reach a total length of `n`. The variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `s`. It prints 'YES' and returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program prints 'YES' and returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
