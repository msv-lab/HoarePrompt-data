The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `s` from the input. It processes the string `s` to find sequences of characters that form a complete set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If the function finds at least `n` such complete sets, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After printing 'NO', the function prints a string for each character in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that was not part of any complete set found in `s`. Each string is composed of the characters in `ans` (the last character of each complete set found), concatenated with the current character from the set, and then padded with 'a' characters to reach a total length of `n`. The function returns `None` in all cases.
