### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros. This is to handle 1-based indexing for the friends.
   - It then reads the list of best friends and appends it to `v` starting from index 1. This is correct and ensures that the list `v` is properly indexed.

3. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends:**
   - The program iterates over each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself (`v[v[i]] == i`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints 2 and returns immediately. This is correct because if `i` and `v[i]` are mutual best friends, inviting both of them will ensure that both come to the party.

4. **Default Case:**
   - If no mutual best friends are found, the program prints 3.
   - This assumption is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. Here, no mutual best friends are found, but inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party, which is the minimum number of invitations required.
   - The program fails to consider other configurations where fewer than 3 invitations might be needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Mutual Best Friends Check:**
  - The check `v[v[i]] == i` correctly identifies pairs of mutual best friends.
  - If such a pair is found, the program correctly prints 2 and returns, as inviting both friends in the pair will ensure they both come to the party.

- **Default Case:**
  - The program assumes that if no mutual best friends are found, the minimum number of invitations required is 3.
  - This assumption is not always correct. For example, in the case where `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, the correct minimum number of invitations is 2, not 3. Inviting friends 1 and 2 will ensure that both 1 and 2 come to the party because 1's best friend is 2, and 2's best friend is 3, who will also have an invitation.

### Conclusion:
- The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider cases where the minimum number of invitations required is 2 even if there are no mutual best friends.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
