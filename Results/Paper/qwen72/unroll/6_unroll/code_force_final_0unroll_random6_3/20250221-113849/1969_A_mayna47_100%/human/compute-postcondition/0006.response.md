The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it is expected to operate within a loop that iterates over a list of test cases. Each test case is a list containing an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct). The function is expected to process these test cases and return a result based on the input values.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n`. It returns a result based on the values of `n` and the list of integers, ensuring that `n` is between 2 and 50, and each `p_i` is a distinct integer between 1 and `n` and not equal to `i`.**
