You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates over a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct).
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
        
    #State: The loop does not modify the values of `n` or `v`. The loop will either print `2` and return if the condition `v[v[i]] == i` is met for any `i` in the range `1` to `n`, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything if the condition is never met.
    print(3)
    #This is printed: 3
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n`. It returns a result based on the values of `n` and the list of integers, ensuring that `n` is between 2 and 50, and each `p_i` is a distinct integer between 1 and `n` and not equal to `i`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
