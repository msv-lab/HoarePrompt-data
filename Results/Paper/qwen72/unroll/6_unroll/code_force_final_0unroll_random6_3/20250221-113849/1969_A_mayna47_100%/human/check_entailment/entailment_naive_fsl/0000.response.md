Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it assumes that if there is at least one pair of friends who are each other's best friends, then the minimum number of invitations needed is 2. However, this is not always true. Consider the following case:

Input:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

In this case, the friends form a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1. To ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to 3 friends, not just 2. The program incorrectly prints 2, which is not the correct minimum number of invitations needed.
