The provided `print` statement is simply printing the integer `3`. The initial state describes a loop that either prints `2` and returns if a certain condition is met, or completes all iterations without printing anything if the condition is never met. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is outside of this loop and will always execute after the loop, regardless of the loop's behavior.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **3**
