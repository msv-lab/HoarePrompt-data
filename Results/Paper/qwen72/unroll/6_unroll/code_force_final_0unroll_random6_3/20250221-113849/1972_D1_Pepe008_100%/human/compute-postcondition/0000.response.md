Output State: **`T` is an input integer, where 1 <= `T` <= 10^4. The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6. The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `T` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 10^4. For each test case, the function calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).**
