Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Initialization**: It initializes a variable `suma` to 0, which will store the count of valid pairs.

3. **Loop for \(b\)**: The program iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(b\).

4. **Calculation of \(x\)**: For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula:
   \[
   x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1
   \]
   This formula is intended to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\).

5. **Condition Check**: It checks if \(x\) is greater than 0 and adds \(x\) to `suma`.

6. **Additional Condition**: It checks if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\). If both conditions are true, it adds 1 to `suma`.

7. **Output**: Finally, it prints `suma - 2` for each test case.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used to calculate \(x\) is not correct. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not accurately captured by the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\).

2. **Additional Condition**: The additional condition \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is also incorrect. The second condition \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is always false for \(i > 1\) because \(i \cdot (i - 1)\) is not divisible by \(i^2\) for \(i > 1\).

3. **Subtraction of 2**: The subtraction of 2 from `suma` is arbitrary and does not seem to be justified by the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach to solve this problem involves understanding the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be simplified using the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD).

For a given \(b\), the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[
a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
\]
for some integer \(k\). This simplifies to:
\[
a = (k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b)
\]
or:
\[
a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
\]

Given that \(a\) must be in the range \([1, n]\), we need to count the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The formula and conditions used are incorrect, and the arbitrary subtraction of 2 is not justified.

Correctness: **False**
