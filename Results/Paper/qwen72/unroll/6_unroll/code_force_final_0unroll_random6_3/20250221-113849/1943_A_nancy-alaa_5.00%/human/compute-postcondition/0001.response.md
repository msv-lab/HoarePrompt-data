Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the first integer `i` that is either not present in the list `arr` or is present exactly once and is the first such integer encountered. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The internal variables `mpp` and `first` are reset for each test case.**
