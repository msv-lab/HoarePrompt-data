### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move given the current state of the game.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to exclude as many small integers as possible from `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always pick the smallest integer that is available in `a` and has not been picked yet.
   - Bob will always pick the smallest integer that is available in `a` and has not been picked yet, unless it is the only occurrence of that integer, in which case he will pick the next smallest integer.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the range from 0 to `n-1` to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in `a` or has only one occurrence and is picked by Bob.
   - The variable `first` is used to track whether Alice has picked the first unique integer.

5. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - **Counting Occurrences:**
     - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - **Finding MEX:**
     - It iterates through the range from 0 to `n-1`:
       - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it means `i` is not in the array `a`, and the MEX is `i`.
       - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and has only one occurrence, and `first` is `True`, it means Bob has already picked the first unique integer, so the MEX is `i`.
       - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and has only one occurrence, it sets `first` to `True` to indicate that Alice has picked the first unique integer.

6. **Optimality Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not in the array or has only one occurrence and is picked by Bob.
   - It ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by following the described strategy.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob, and it correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` based on the given problem description.

**Correctness: True**
