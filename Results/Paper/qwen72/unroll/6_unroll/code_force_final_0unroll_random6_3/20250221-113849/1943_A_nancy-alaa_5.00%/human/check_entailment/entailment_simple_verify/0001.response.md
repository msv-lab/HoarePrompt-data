### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob alternately pick elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c` and deletes it from `a`.
   - Bob deletes the picked element from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score of the game is the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to remove elements that would otherwise be included by Alice, especially those that are unique and small.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range `0` to `n-1` to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` that is not in `arr` or is unique and has been picked by Alice.

4. **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - **Counting Elements:**
     - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - **Finding the MEX:**
     - It initializes a variable `first` to `False` to track if Alice has picked a unique element.
     - It iterates through the range `0` to `n-1`:
       - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This means `i` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `arr`, which is the MEX.
       - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and has a count of 1, and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This means Alice has already picked a unique element, and Bob will pick the next unique element, making `i` the MEX.
       - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and has a count of 1, it sets `first` to `True`. This means Alice will pick this unique element on her next turn.

5. **Optimality Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `arr` or is unique and has been picked by Alice.
   - However, the logic for handling unique elements is flawed. The program assumes that if a unique element is found and `first` is `True`, then `i` is the MEX. This is not always correct because Bob can also pick unique elements, and the MEX should be determined based on the final state of `c` after all elements are picked.

6. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `[0, 0, 1, 1]`:
     - The program correctly identifies that `2` is the MEX because `0` and `1` are both present in `arr`.
   - For the input `[0, 1, 2, 3]`:
     - The program correctly identifies that `1` is the MEX because `0` is the first unique element picked by Alice, and Bob will pick the next unique element, which is `1`.
   - For the input `[1, 1]`:
     - The program correctly identifies that `0` is the MEX because `0` is not present in `arr`.

7. **Flaw in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where Bob can also pick unique elements. The MEX should be determined based on the final state of `c` after all elements are picked, not just by checking the presence of unique elements in `arr`.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is incorrect because it does not fully account for the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob, especially in scenarios where Bob can pick unique elements. The MEX should be determined based on the final state of `c` after all elements are picked, not just by checking the presence of unique elements in `arr`.

Final: **False**
