You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then prints the first integer `i` that is either not present in `arr` or is present exactly once and is the first such integer encountered. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not modified within the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they alternately pick elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c` and deletes it from `a`.
   - Bob deletes the picked element from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score of the game is the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to remove elements that would otherwise be included by Alice, especially those that are unique and small.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range `0` to `n-1` to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` that is not in `arr` or is unique and has been picked by Alice.

4. **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - **Counting Elements:**
     - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - **Finding the MEX:**
     - It initializes a variable `first` to `False` to track if Alice has picked a unique element.
     - It iterates through the range `0` to `n-1`:
       - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This means `i` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `arr`, which is the MEX.
       - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and has a count of 1, and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This means Alice has already picked a unique element, and Bob will pick the next unique element, making `i` the MEX.
       - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and has a count of 1, it sets `first` to `True`. This means Alice will pick this unique element on her next turn.

5. **Optimality Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `arr` or is unique and has been picked by Alice.
   - It ensures that Alice picks unique elements first, and Bob picks the next unique elements, which is the optimal strategy for both players.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob and correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Correctness:
**True**
