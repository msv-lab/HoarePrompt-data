Output State: **The loop executes `T` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, and a list of integers `lst` of length `2n`. It then processes the list to find and print pairs of integers from the left and right halves of the sorted list, ensuring that the total number of printed integers is `k`. After each iteration, the variables `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `sz` are reset for the next iteration. The final state of these variables is undefined as they are reinitialized in each iteration. The only variable that remains unchanged is `T`, which is the total number of iterations the loop will execute.**
