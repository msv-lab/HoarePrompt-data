Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it processes the input to determine if Dmitry's favorite cube can remain after removing `k` cubes. The variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are reinitialized at the start of each iteration based on the input, and the loop prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each iteration. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` will be in their final state as determined by the last iteration's input, but the overall state of the program will depend on the sequence of inputs provided.**
