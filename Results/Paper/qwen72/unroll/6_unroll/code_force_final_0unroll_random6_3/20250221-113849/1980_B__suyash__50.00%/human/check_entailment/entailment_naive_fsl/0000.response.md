Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes, and the position of the favorite cube after sorting is not correctly determined. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the index of the favorite cube in the sorted list is the only factor to consider. However, it should also account for the possibility that multiple cubes with the same value could be removed or not removed based on the value of `k`.

Example case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 2 2
  4 3 3 2 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  MAYBE
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

The program incorrectly prints "NO" because it does not correctly handle the scenario where the favorite cube (with value 3) could be in the first or second position after sorting, leading to it being removed or not removed depending on the order of the cubes with the same value.
