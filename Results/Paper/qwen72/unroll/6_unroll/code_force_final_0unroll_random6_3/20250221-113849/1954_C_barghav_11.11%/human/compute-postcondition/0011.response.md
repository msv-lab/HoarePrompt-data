The function `func_1` is described with the following parameters and constraints: It accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same number of digits. Additionally, the function handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.

However, the function signature provided does not include these parameters. Assuming the function signature is actually `def func_1(t, x, y):`, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 <= `t` <= 1000. `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same number of digits. The function returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.**
