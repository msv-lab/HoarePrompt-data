Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, the first half of the list `a` will contain the maximum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, while the second half of the list `a` will contain the minimum values. Conversely, the first half of the list `b` will contain the minimum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, while the second half of the list `b` will contain the maximum values. The length of `a` and `b` remains the same, and the number of test cases `t` is unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` remain the same as they were in the initial state. 

**Example:**
- If `a = ['3', '5', '2', '8']` and `b = ['4', '1', '9', '7']`, after the loop:
  - `a` will be `['4', '5', '2', '7']`
  - `b` will be `['3', '1', '9', '8']`
