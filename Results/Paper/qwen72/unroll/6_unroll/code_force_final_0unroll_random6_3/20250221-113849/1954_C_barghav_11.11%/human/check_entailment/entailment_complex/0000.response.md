### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over them using a for loop.
   - However, the function `func_1` is called without any parameters, which is incorrect because it should be passed the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without any parameters, which means it cannot access the values of `x` and `y` that are read from the input.
   - Inside the function, `a` and `b` are read as lists of characters from the input, which is correct for the problem's requirements.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The function attempts to maximize the product by swapping the digits in the first half of the lists and minimizing the product in the second half.
   - The logic for swapping is flawed. The goal is to maximize the product of `x` and `y`, but the current implementation only swaps the digits in the first half to be the maximum and the digits in the second half to be the minimum. This does not necessarily maximize the product.

4. **Output:**
   - The function correctly prints the modified lists `a` and `b` after the operations.
   - However, the output is not guaranteed to be the correct solution because the swapping logic is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not handle the input parameters correctly, and the logic for maximizing the product is flawed. The correct approach would involve comparing and swapping digits in a way that maximizes the product of the two numbers.

### Correctness: **False**
