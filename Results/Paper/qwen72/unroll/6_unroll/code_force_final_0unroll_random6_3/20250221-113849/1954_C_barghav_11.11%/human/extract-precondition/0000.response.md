Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters, x and y, which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same number of digits. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, the integers `x` and `y`. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def maximize_product(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `x` and `y`.

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of length t, where each element is a tuple (x, y) with x and y being integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and having the same number of digits.**
