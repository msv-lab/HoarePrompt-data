Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads two lines of input, each representing a list of digits (1-9) of the same length. The function then modifies these lists such that the first half of the first list contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the two lists, and the second half contains the minimum values. Conversely, the first half of the second list contains the minimum values, and the second half contains the maximum values. After processing, the function prints the modified first list, followed by a blank line, and then the modified second list, each on a new line. The number of test cases `t` is not handled within this function. **
