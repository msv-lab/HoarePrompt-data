Output State: **The first half of the list `a` will contain the maximum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, while the second half of the list `a` will contain the minimum values. Conversely, the first half of the list `b` will contain the minimum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, while the second half of the list `b` will contain the maximum values. The length of both lists remains the same, and the number of test cases `t` is unchanged.**
