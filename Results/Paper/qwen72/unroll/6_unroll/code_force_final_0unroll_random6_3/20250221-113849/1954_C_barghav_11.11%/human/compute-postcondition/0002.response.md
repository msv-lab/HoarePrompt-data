To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element, and `i` will start at 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `a` is a list of characters from the input string.
- `b` is a list of characters from the new input string.
- The function should accept two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same number of digits.
- The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.

For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(len(a))`.

State: **`a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is 0**
