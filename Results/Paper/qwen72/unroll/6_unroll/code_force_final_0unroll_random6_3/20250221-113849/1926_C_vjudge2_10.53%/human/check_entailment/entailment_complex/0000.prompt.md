Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes.
def func_1():

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the last integer input between 1 and 2 · 10^5, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each between 1 and 2 · 10^5.

        values[i] = i
        
        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` remains the last integer input between 1 and 2 · 10^5, `numbers` remains a list containing `t` integers, each between 1 and 2 · 10^5, `values` is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], `sum_values` is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45], and `total` is 45.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` remains the last integer input between 1 and 2 · 10^5, `numbers` remains a list containing `t` integers, each between 1 and 2 · 10^5, `values` is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and the subsequent elements up to index `n` are filled according to the loop logic, `sum_values` is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45] and the subsequent elements up to index `n` are filled according to the loop logic, and `total` is 45.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: The `sum_values` list is accessed and printed for each integer in the `numbers` list. The values of `t`, `n`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `total` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number. It then calculates a cumulative sum of values for numbers up to the largest `n` across all test cases, where each value is determined by the sum of the values of its last digit and the remaining part of the number. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum for each `n` in the test cases. The function does not return any value; it only performs input and output operations.
