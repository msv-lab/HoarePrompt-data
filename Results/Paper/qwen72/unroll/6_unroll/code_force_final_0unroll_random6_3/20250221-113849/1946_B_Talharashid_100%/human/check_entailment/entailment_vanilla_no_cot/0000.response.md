Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly address the problem. The logic used to calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - The code attempts to find the maximum subarray sum using a sliding window approach, but it does not correctly handle the case where the maximum subarray sum can be the sum of the entire array. The logic to reset `c` to 0 when encountering a negative number is not appropriate for this problem.

2. **Incorrect Final Calculation**:
   - The final calculation `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is incorrect. The idea of multiplying the maximum subarray sum by `2 ** k` and then subtracting `maxi` and adding the sum of the array is not a valid approach to solve the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following:

1. **Sum of the Array**:
   - Calculate the sum of the entire array, `total_sum`.

2. **Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum, `max_subarray_sum`.

3. **Handling Negative Sums**:
   - If the sum of the array is negative, the best strategy is to insert the sum of the maximum subarray repeatedly. This is because inserting the sum of the entire array would only decrease the total sum.

4. **Handling Non-Negative Sums**:
   - If the sum of the array is non-negative, the best strategy is to insert the sum of the entire array repeatedly. This is because the sum of the entire array is already the maximum possible sum.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - If `total_sum` is non-negative, the maximum sum after `k` operations is `total_sum * (k + 1) % 1000000007`.
   - If `total_sum` is negative, the maximum sum after `k` operations is `max_subarray_sum * (k + 1) % 1000000007`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        total_sum = sum(l)
        max_subarray_sum = float('-inf')
        current_sum = 0
        
        for ele in l:
            current_sum = max(ele, current_sum + ele)
            max_subarray_sum = max(max_subarray_sum, current_sum)
        
        if total_sum >= 0:
            result = (total_sum * (k + 1)) % MOD
        else:
            result = (max_subarray_sum * (k + 1)) % MOD
        
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected code uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and correctly handles the cases where the sum of the array is negative or non-negative. It then calculates the maximum possible sum after `k` operations and prints the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
