The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be a positive integer. This result is the total number of test cases `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Given that the function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, and the total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
