The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `l`. It then counts the number of elements in `l` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements in `l`. The function prints this count for each test case. The variables `a` and `b` are used to track the smallest and second smallest elements, but their final values are not part of the output.
