#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`. The specific integer value returned depends on the implementation of `func_1()`, which is not provided. The function does not modify any external state or variables.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts no parameters but internally uses `n`, `m`, and `x` which are integers such that `2 <= n <= 1000`, `1 <= m <= 1000`, and `1 <= x <= n`. It generates a set `ans` of unique values by repeatedly adding or subtracting a value `r` (obtained from `func_1`) to the initial value `x` (or any subsequent values in `ans`), and taking the result modulo `n`. If the value `0` is present in `ans` at the end, it is replaced by `n`. The function then prints the number of unique values in `ans` and the sorted list of these unique values. The function does not return any value.
