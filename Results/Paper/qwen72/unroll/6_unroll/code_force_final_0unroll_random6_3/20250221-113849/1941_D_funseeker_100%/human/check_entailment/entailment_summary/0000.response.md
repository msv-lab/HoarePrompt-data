### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This is a common utility function for reading input.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer.
   - `func_3` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part to an integer, returning a list of integers. This is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.

2. **Game Simulation:**
   - `func_4` is the main function that simulates the game for each test case.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` from the input.
   - It then updates the set `ans` by considering both possible directions (clockwise and counterclockwise) if the direction is unknown (`?`), or only the specified direction if known (`0` or `1`).
   - The set `ans` is updated by adding the new positions to a temporary set `temp` and then setting `ans` to `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - After all throws, if `0` is in the set `ans`, it is replaced by `n` to handle the modulo operation correctly (since player `0` is not valid, and player `n` is the same as player `0` in a circular arrangement).

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the number of players who could have the ball and the sorted list of these players.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem.
- The game simulation logic is implemented correctly:
  - It uses a set to keep track of all possible positions of the ball.
  - It correctly updates the set by considering both directions when the direction is unknown.
  - It handles the circular nature of the game by using modulo `n`.
  - It correctly replaces `0` with `n` to handle the edge case where the ball could end up at position `0`.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the problem description and handles all the required cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
