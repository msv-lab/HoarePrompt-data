### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This function is used to read the input for each test case.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer.
   - `func_3` reads a line from standard input, splits it into parts, and converts each part to an integer. This function is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `func_4` processes each test case. It reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` using `func_1`.
   - Depending on the direction `c`, it updates the set `ans` by adding the possible positions the ball could be in after the throw. If the direction is unknown (`?`), it considers both clockwise and counterclockwise throws.
   - The set `ans` is updated to include all possible positions after each throw.
   - After all throws, if `0` is in the set `ans`, it is replaced by `n` to handle the circular nature of the game.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique positions in `ans` and the sorted list of these positions.

3. **Handling Circular Nature:**
   - The use of modulo `n` ensures that the positions wrap around correctly in a circular manner.
   - The check and replacement of `0` with `n` ensures that the positions are correctly represented as player numbers (1 to `n`).

4. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The logic for updating the set `ans` based on the direction `c` is correct. It considers both possible directions when `c` is `?`.
   - The set `ans` is used to keep track of all possible positions of the ball, which is appropriate given the problem constraints.
   - The final output correctly prints the number of possible positions and the sorted list of these positions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct results for the positions of the ball after `m` throws.

**Correctness: True**
