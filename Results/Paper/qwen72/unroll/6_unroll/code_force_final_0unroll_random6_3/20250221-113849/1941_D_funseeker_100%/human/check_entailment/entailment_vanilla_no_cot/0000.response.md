Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each throw according to the rules, and outputs the correct number of players who could have the ball at the end of the game, along with their numbers in increasing order. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()` reads an integer from a line.
   - `func_3()` reads a line and splits it into a list of integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions if `c` is '?'.
   - The program correctly handles the circular nature of the game by using modulo `n` operations.

3. **Output**:
   - If the set `ans` contains `0`, it is replaced with `n` to account for the circular nature of the player numbering.
   - The program prints the number of players in `ans` and then the sorted list of player numbers.

The program handles all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description, and it produces the correct output for the given example. Therefore, the program is correct.
