To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, let's break down the loop and its operations step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for _ in range(m):
    r, c = func_1().split()
    r = int(r)
    temp = set()
    for q in ans:
        if c == '0' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q + r) % n)
        if c == '1' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q - r) % n)
    ans = temp
```

### Explanation:
1. The loop runs `m` times.
2. In each iteration, `func_1()` returns a string that is split into `r` and `c`.
3. `r` is converted to an integer.
4. A new set `temp` is initialized.
5. For each element `q` in the set `ans`:
   - If `c` is '0' or '?', `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.
   - If `c` is '1' or '?', `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.
6. After processing all elements in `ans`, `ans` is updated to `temp`.

### Output State:
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `ans` will be a set containing all possible values of `q` after `m` iterations, where each iteration can either add `r` or subtract `r` from `q` and take the result modulo `n`.

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop finishes executing, the set `ans` will contain all unique values that can be generated by adding or subtracting `r` (from `func_1()`) to the initial value `x` (or any subsequent values in `ans`), and taking the result modulo `n`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` will remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, `ans` is a set containing all unique values generated by adding or subtracting `r` to the initial value `x` (or any subsequent values in `ans`), and taking the result modulo `n`.**
