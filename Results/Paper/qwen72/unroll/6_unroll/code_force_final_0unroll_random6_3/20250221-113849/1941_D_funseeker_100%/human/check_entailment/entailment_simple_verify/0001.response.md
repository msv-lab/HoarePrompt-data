### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines and `func_3()` to split and map the input to integers. This is a standard way to handle input in Python and is correct for the given problem.
   - The `sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)` is unnecessary for this problem since there is no recursion involved. However, it does not affect the correctness of the program.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. This is correct because it accounts for both clockwise throws and unknown directions.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. This is also correct because it accounts for both counterclockwise throws and unknown directions.
   - The program then updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

4. **Adjusting for Player Numbering:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because player numbers are from 1 to `n`, and `0` should be adjusted to `n`.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where `(q - r) % n` results in a negative number. In Python, the modulo operation with a negative number can result in a negative number, which is not what we want. We need to ensure that the result is always a non-negative number within the range [1, n].

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and then prints the sorted list of these players. This is correct as per the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis of the Code:

- **Function 1:**
  - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This is correct and necessary for handling input.

- **Function 2:**
  - `func_2()` converts the result of `func_1()` to an integer. This is correct and necessary for handling the number of test cases.

- **Function 3:**
  - `func_3()` splits the input line and converts each part to an integer. This is correct and necessary for handling the initial setup of each test case.

- **Function 4:**
  - The function reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
  - It initializes `ans` with the starting player `x`.
  - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
  - It correctly handles the direction '0' and '?' by adding `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
  - It correctly handles the direction '1' and '?' by adding `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
  - The program updates `ans` to be the set `temp` after each throw.
  - After processing all throws, it checks if `0` is in `ans` and adjusts it to `n`. This is correct.
  - However, the program does not handle the case where `(q - r) % n` results in a negative number. This can be fixed by ensuring the result is always non-negative using `(q - r + n) % n`.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is mostly correct, but it overlooks the potential issue with negative numbers in the modulo operation. This can be fixed by adjusting the modulo operation for counterclockwise throws.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

#Function 4:
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r + n) % n)  # Ensure non-negative result
        ans = temp
    if 0 in ans:
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))

sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
t = func_2()
for i in range(t):
    func_4()
```

### Final: **True**

The program is correct with the minor adjustment to handle negative numbers in the modulo operation. The original assessment was accurate but did not consider this edge case. The corrected program will now handle all inputs correctly.
