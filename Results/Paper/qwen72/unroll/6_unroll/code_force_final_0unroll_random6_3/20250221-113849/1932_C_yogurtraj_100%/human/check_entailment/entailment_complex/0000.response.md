### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the list `a`, and the string `s` as required.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `l` to the count of 'L' commands in the string `s`.
   - It initializes `k` to the remainder of the product of the array `a` after the first command is processed.
   - The variables `q1` and `q2` are used to track the indices of the elements to be removed from the array `a` based on the commands 'L' and 'R'.

3. **Initial Command Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles the last command in the string `s` to initialize `k` and set the initial indices `q1` and `q2`.

4. **Loop for Processing Commands**:
   - The function iterates through the commands in reverse order (from `n-2` to `0`).
   - For each command, it updates `k` by multiplying it with the appropriate element from `a` and taking the result modulo `m`.
   - It correctly updates the indices `q1` and `q2` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each test case as a space-separated list of integers.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Initial Command Handling**:
  - The initial handling of the last command in the string `s` is incorrect. The function should compute the product of all elements in `a` and take the remainder modulo `m` before processing any commands.
  - The initial value of `k` should be the product of all elements in `a` modulo `m`, not just the last element based on the command.

- **Incorrect Index Management**:
  - The indices `q1` and `q2` are not correctly managed. The function should use a single index to track the current state of the array `a` and update it based on the commands.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        t = input()
        
        # Compute the initial product modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        y = [0] * n
        
        # Process commands from left to right
        for i in range(n):
            y[i] = product
            if t[i] == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[i], -1, m)) % m
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[n - 1 - i], -1, m)) % m
        
        print(*y)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Product Calculation**:
  - The product of all elements in `a` is computed and taken modulo `m` before processing any commands.
- **Command Processing**:
  - For each command, the current product is stored in `y`.
  - The product is updated by dividing it by the element to be removed. This is done using the modular inverse (`pow(a[i], -1, m)`) to ensure the result is correct modulo `m`.

### Correctness:
- The original program does not correctly handle the initial product and the indices for removing elements. Therefore, it will produce incorrect results.

**Correctness: **False****

The corrected program should be used to ensure the correct behavior as per the problem description.
