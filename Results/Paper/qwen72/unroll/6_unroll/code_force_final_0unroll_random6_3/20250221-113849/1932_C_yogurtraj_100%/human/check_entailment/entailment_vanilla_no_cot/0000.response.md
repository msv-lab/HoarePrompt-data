Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly process the commands as described in the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `q1` and `q2`:**
   - The variables `q1` and `q2` are used to track the indices of the elements to be multiplied, but they are initialized incorrectly. The program assumes that the number of 'L' commands is the same as the number of elements to be removed from the left, which is not always true.

2. **Incorrect Handling of 'L' and 'R' Commands:**
   - The program attempts to update `k` by multiplying it with elements from `a` using `q1` and `q2`. However, the logic for updating these indices is flawed. For example, if the last command is 'L', the program incorrectly sets `k` to `a[l - 1] % m` and `q1` to `l - 2`, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Incorrect Product Calculation:**
   - The program does not correctly calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array after each command. It should maintain the product of the current state of the array and update it accordingly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
- Maintain the product of the current state of the array.
- Update the product by removing the appropriate element based on the command.
- Output the remainder of the product after each command.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        t = input()
        
        # Initialize the product of all elements
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        # Output the initial product
        results = [product]
        
        # Process each command
        for i in range(n):
            if t[i] == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[i], -1, m)) % m
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[n - 1 - i], -1, m)) % m
            results.append(product)
        
        # Print the results
        print(*results[:-1])

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Product Initialization:**
  - The product of all elements in the array is calculated and taken modulo `m`.
- **Command Processing:**
  - For each command, the product is updated by removing the appropriate element. This is done using the modular inverse of the element to be removed, which is calculated using `pow(a[i], -1, m)`.
- **Output:**
  - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, excluding the last element which is an extra result due to the loop structure.

This approach ensures that the product is correctly updated and the commands are processed in the correct order.
