Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `m`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters 'L' and 'R'. It computes a list `y` of `n` integers where each element is derived based on the characters in `s` and the values in `a`, modulo `m`. The function prints the list `y` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution, and the program ends. **
