### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initial Setup:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the length of the array and the modulus value.
   - It then reads the array `a` and the command string `t`.

2. **Counting 'L' Commands:**
   - The variable `l` is used to count the number of 'L' commands in the string `t`.

3. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The variable `k` is initialized to the remainder of the product of the array elements when divided by `m`.
   - The initial value of `k` is set based on the last command in `t`:
     - If the last command is 'L', `k` is set to `a[l - 1] % m`.
     - If the last command is 'R', `k` is set to `a[l] % m`.

4. **Indices for Array Elements:**
   - The variables `q1` and `q2` are used to track the indices of the array elements that are being considered for the product calculation.
   - `q1` is initialized to `l - 2` if the last command is 'L', otherwise to `l - 1`.
   - `q2` is initialized to `l` if the last command is 'L', otherwise to `l + 1`.

5. **Output Array Initialization:**
   - The array `y` is initialized to store the results of the product modulo `m` for each command.

6. **Processing Commands:**
   - The loop starts from the second last command and goes to the first command.
   - For each command:
     - If the command is 'R', `k` is updated by multiplying it with the element at index `q2` and taking the result modulo `m`, then `q2` is incremented.
     - If the command is 'L', `k` is updated by multiplying it with the element at index `q1` and taking the result modulo `m`, then `q1` is decremented.
   - The updated value of `k` is stored in the corresponding position in `y`.

7. **Output:**
   - The results in `y` are printed for each test case.

### Issues and Corrections:

1. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The initial product calculation is incorrect. The product of all elements should be calculated first, and then the remainder should be taken.
   - The current implementation only sets `k` based on the last command, which is not correct.

2. **Indices for Array Elements:**
   - The indices `q1` and `q2` are not correctly set up to track the elements being removed from the array.
   - `q1` should start from the leftmost element and `q2` from the rightmost element.

3. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The product of all elements should be calculated first.
   - The product should be updated correctly based on the command being 'L' or 'R'.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        t = input()
        
        # Calculate the initial product modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        # Initialize the output array
        y = [0] * n
        y[0] = product
        
        # Process the commands
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if t[i] == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[i], m - 2, m)) % m
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[n - 1 - i], m - 2, m)) % m
            y[i + 1] = product
        
        print(*y)
```

### Explanation of Corrections:
- **Initial Product Calculation:**
  - The initial product is calculated by iterating through the array and taking the product modulo `m`.
- **Modular Inverse:**
  - When an element is removed, the product needs to be divided by that element. To handle this in modular arithmetic, we use the modular inverse of the element, which is calculated using `pow(a[i], m - 2, m)` (Fermat's Little Theorem for modular inverse when `m` is prime).
- **Correct Indices:**
  - The indices for removing elements are correctly set to `a[i]` for 'L' and `a[n - 1 - i]` for 'R'.

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program does not correctly handle the product calculation and the removal of elements based on the commands. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly.
