The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it is expected to be called within a context that provides the necessary inputs through standard input or a similar mechanism. These inputs consist of multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `m`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given inputs. The specific output for each test case is not described, but it is implied that the function will return a value or a list of values corresponding to the processing of each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two integers `n` and `m`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and a string `s` of length `n` with characters 'L' and 'R'. It returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
