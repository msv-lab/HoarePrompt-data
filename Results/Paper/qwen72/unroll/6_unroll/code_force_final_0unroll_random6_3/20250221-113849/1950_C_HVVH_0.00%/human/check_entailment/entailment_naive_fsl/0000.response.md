Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles the transition between AM and PM. Specifically, for times between 01:00 and 11:59, the program incorrectly sets the time to PM. For example, for the input "09:41", the program will output "09:41 PM" instead of "09:41 AM". This is because the `else` block incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' before checking if `h` is 12. The correct logic should set `day` to 'AM' for hours between 00 and 11, and to 'PM' for hours between 12 and 23.
