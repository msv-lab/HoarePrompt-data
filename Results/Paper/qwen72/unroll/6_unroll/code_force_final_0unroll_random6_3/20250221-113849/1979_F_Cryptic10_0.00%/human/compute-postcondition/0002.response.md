The only object in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `remaining_vertices` is non-empty. Right before the loop, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. Since `remaining_vertices` is already non-empty (it contains at least the integers from 1 to n), the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive**
