The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be within this range, it is non-zero and the loop can certainly execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3**
