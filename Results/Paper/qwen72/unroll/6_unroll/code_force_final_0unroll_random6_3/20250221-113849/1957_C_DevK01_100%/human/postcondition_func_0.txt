The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the size of a chessboard. It computes a sequence of values based on a specific formula and returns the last computed value of this sequence. The sequence is calculated using dynamic programming, and the function ensures that only the last two computed values are stored in the list `dp` at any point. After the function concludes, the list `dp` contains the last two values of the sequence, but only the last computed value (the first element of `dp`) is returned.
