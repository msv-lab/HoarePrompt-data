Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the chessboard size `n` is 1 and `k` is 0. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1 and `k` is 0, there should be exactly one possible final configuration, which is the empty board. However, the function `func_1` in the program will return 1, which is correct, but the logic for handling the input and processing the moves is flawed. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that if `n` is 1 and `k` is 0, the board is already in its final configuration with no moves made. The program should directly return 1 in such a case without calling `func_1`.

Example Input:
```
1
1 0
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

However, the program's logic is not robust enough to handle this edge case explicitly, and it relies on the function `func_1` to return the correct result, which is not a reliable approach for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
