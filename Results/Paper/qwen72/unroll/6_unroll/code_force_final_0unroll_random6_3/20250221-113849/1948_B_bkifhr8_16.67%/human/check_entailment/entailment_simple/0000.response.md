### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program iterates through the array to check if any element is out of order (`list1[p - 1] > list1[p]`).
   - If an element is out of order and greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the array at the appropriate positions.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After attempting to split elements, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function compares the original list `lst` with its sorted version `sorted_lst` and returns `True` if they are the same (i.e., the list is sorted).

4. **Flaw in the Logic:**
   - The program only performs the split operation once for each out-of-order element. However, the problem description allows for multiple operations to be performed until the array is sorted.
   - The program does not account for the possibility that splitting an element might still leave the array unsorted, and further operations might be necessary.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. After splitting `12` into `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, the array is still unsorted. The program does not continue to split `28` into `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]` to check if the array can be sorted.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints `Yes` if the array is sorted after the operations and `No` otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the possibility of performing multiple operations to sort the array. It only performs a single split operation for each out-of-order element, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be sorted as required by the problem description.

### Correctness:
**False**
