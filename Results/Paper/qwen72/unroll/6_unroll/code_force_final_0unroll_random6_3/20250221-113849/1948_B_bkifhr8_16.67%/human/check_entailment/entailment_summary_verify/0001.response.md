### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Operation Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the array `list1` and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if it is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it performs the operation of splitting the current element into its digits and inserting them back into the array.

3. **Splitting Logic**:
   - The program correctly splits the element `a` into its tens and units digits using `a // 10` and `a % 10`.
   - It then removes the original element and inserts the tens digit at the same position and the units digit at the next position.

4. **Sorting Check**:
   - After performing the operations, the program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function compares the original array with its sorted version and returns `True` if they are the same, indicating the array is sorted.

5. **Single Pass Through the Array**:
   - The program only performs the operation once for each element in the array. This is incorrect because the operation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array.
   - For example, in the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the first pass will split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but the array is not yet sorted. Another pass is needed to split `45` into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.

6. **Inefficient Sorting Check**:
   - The program checks if the array is sorted after each operation, which is inefficient. It should check if the array is sorted only once after all necessary operations are performed.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split in a single pass. For example, in the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, both `12` and `45` need to be split to achieve a sorted array.
   - Additionally, the program does not handle cases where the array might become sorted after multiple passes through the array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it only performs the operation once for each element and does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split in a single pass to achieve a sorted array. Additionally, the sorting check is performed inefficiently.

Final: **False**
