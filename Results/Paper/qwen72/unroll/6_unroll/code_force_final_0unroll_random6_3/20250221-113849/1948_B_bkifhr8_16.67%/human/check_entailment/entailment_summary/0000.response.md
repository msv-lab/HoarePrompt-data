Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if it is possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program only splits the first element it finds that is greater than the next element and is also greater than 10. This is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted. The correct approach would be to split all elements that are greater than 10 and then check if the resulting array is sorted.

2. **Single Pass Through the Array**: The program only makes a single pass through the array and splits the first element that meets the criteria. This might not be enough to fully transform the array into a sorted state, especially if multiple elements need to be split.

3. **Checking Sorted Condition**: The function `func_1` correctly checks if the array is sorted, but it is called after only one potential split. This means that if the array needs more than one split to become sorted, the program will not detect it.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Split all elements that are greater than 10 into their digits.
- After splitting, check if the resulting array is sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Split all elements that are greater than 10
    new_list = []
    for num in list1:
        if num >= 10:
            for digit in str(num):
                new_list.append(int(digit))
        else:
            new_list.append(num)
    
    # Check if the resulting array is sorted
    if func_1(new_list):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
```

Given the current implementation, the program will not always correctly determine if the array can be sorted. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
