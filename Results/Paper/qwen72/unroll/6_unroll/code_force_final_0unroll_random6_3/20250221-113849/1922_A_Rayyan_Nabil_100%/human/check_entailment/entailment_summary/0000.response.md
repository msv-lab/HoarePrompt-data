Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The conditions for a string to match the template are:
1. If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be the same as the i-th letter of the template.
2. If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th letter of the template.

The function `func_1` checks if there is at least one index `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index exists, it returns 'YES', indicating that a template can be constructed where `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not. If no such index exists, it returns 'NO'.

However, this approach is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly. The function `func_1` only checks if there is an index where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, but it does not ensure that the template can be constructed such that both `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that for each position `i`:
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template must have that same lowercase letter at position `i`.
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template can have any uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

Additionally, for each position `i`, `c[i]` must not match the template:
- If the template has a lowercase letter at position `i`, `c[i]` must be different.
- If the template has an uppercase letter at position `i`, `c[i]` must be the same as the lowercase version of the template.

The function `func_1` does not perform these checks. It only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` at any position, which is not enough to ensure the existence of a valid template.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
