### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if there exists a template `t` such that:
     - `a` and `b` match the template.
     - `c` does not match the template.
   - A string `s` matches the template `t` if:
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is lowercase, `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is uppercase, `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function iterates over each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If this condition is true for any position `i`, it returns 'YES'.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a position, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the list.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Function 1**:
     - The logic in `func_1` is correct. If there exists any position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, we can construct a template `t` where `t[i]` is the uppercase version of `c[i]`. This ensures that `a` and `b` match the template, but `c` does not.
     - However, the function only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. It does not check if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same as each other, which is a necessary condition for them to match the template.
     - For example, if `a = "abc"`, `b = "def"`, and `c = "ghi"`, the function will return 'YES' because `a[0] != c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]`. However, this is incorrect because `a` and `b` do not match the same template at position 0.
     - Therefore, the function `func_1` is incomplete and does not fully capture the conditions required for the template.

   - **Function 2**:
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
     - It prints the results in the correct format.

5. **Annotated Code Review**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - However, the annotations do not highlight the missing condition in `func_1` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be the same for the template to be valid.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is missing a crucial check to ensure that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same at positions where they differ from `c[i]`. Therefore, the program can produce incorrect results in some cases.

### Final:
**False**
