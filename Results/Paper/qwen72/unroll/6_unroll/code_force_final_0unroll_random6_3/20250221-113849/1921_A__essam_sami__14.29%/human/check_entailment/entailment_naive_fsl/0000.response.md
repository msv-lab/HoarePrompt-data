Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for every potential case. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the side length of the square. The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and then returns the smaller of the two distances as the area. However, this approach does not guarantee that the correct side length is being used, especially when the points are not in a specific order.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
0 0
0 1
1 0
1 1
```
The program will calculate:
- `n = (0 - 1) * (0 - 1) + (0 - 0) * (0 - 0) = 1`
- `x = (0 - 1) * (0 - 1) + (1 - 1) * (1 - 1) = 1`

Since both `n` and `x` are equal, the program will print `1`, which is incorrect because the area of the square is `1 * 1 = 1`, but the program should return `1` as the area, not the side length squared.

The correct approach would be to identify the side length by finding the minimum distance between any two points in the x or y direction and then squaring this distance to get the area.
