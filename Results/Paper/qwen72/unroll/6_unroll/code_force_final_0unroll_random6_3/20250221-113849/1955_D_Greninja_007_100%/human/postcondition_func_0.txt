The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the number of sublists of length `m` in the list `a` that have a sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements with the list `b` greater than or equal to `k`. The function does not modify the input lists `a` and `b`.
