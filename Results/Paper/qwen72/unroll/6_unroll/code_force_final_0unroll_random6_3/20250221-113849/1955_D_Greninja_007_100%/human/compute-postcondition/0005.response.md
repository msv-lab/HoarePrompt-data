The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`, `ans` is 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between the sorted sublist `a[:m]` and the sorted list `b`, and the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
