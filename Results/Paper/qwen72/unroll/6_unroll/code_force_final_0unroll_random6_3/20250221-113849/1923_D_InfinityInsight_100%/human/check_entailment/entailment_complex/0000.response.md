### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report -1 if it is impossible.
   - The process involves slimes eating their neighbors if they are strictly larger, and this continues until no more slimes can eat their neighbors.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is used to find the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.
   - If `x` is found in the list, it returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` plus 1.
   - If `x` is not found, it returns the index `inx` where `a[inx]` is the smallest element greater than `x`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the list `a` to determine the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.
   - It maintains a cumulative sum list `left` and a list `last` to track the last occurrence of each value before a different value appears.
   - For each slime, if it is smaller than its previous neighbor, it is marked as being eaten in 1 second.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum time by using `func_1` to find the closest previous slime that can eat it.

4. **Main Program:**
   - The main program reads multiple test cases and processes each one.
   - It calls `func_2` on the original list and the reversed list to handle both left and right neighbors.
   - It combines the results to ensure the minimum time is reported for each slime.

5. **Verification:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first element greater than or equal to `x` or returns -1 if `x` is less than 0.
   - The function `func_2` correctly updates the `ans` list based on the conditions provided.
   - The main program correctly combines the results from both directions to ensure the minimum time is reported.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the edge cases and the main logic as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: **True****
