Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. Here are the reasons:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or determining if it is impossible.
   - The process involves slimes eating their neighbors if they are strictly larger, and this continues until no more slimes can eat their neighbors.

2. **Issues with the Program**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function is intended to find the index of the smallest element in the prefix sum array that is greater than or equal to a given value `x`.
     - However, it does not correctly handle the case where `x` is not found in the array. It returns `inx + 1` which is not always the correct index.
     - Additionally, the function does not consider the scenario where the slime cannot be eaten because there is no larger neighbor.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - The function maintains a `left` array which is the prefix sum of the sizes of the slimes.
     - The `last` array is intended to keep track of the last index where the size of the slime is different from the previous one.
     - The logic for updating `ans` is flawed. It only considers the left neighbor and does not handle the right neighbor correctly.
     - The program does not correctly simulate the process of slimes eating each other. It only checks the immediate left neighbor and does not consider the possibility of the slime being eaten by a right neighbor or the combined effect of multiple slimes.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, you need to simulate the process of slimes eating each other.
   - For each slime, you need to check both its left and right neighbors to determine the minimum time it can be eaten.
   - You should also handle the case where a slime cannot be eaten by any other slime.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_time_to_be_eaten(a):
    n = len(a)
    ans = [-1] * n
    left = [0] * n
    right = [0] * n
    
    # Calculate the minimum time to be eaten from the left
    stack = []
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and a[stack[-1]] < a[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            left[i] = i - stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)
    
    # Calculate the minimum time to be eaten from the right
    stack = []
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        while stack and a[stack[-1]] < a[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            right[i] = stack[-1] - i
        stack.append(i)
    
    # Determine the minimum time to be eaten
    for i in range(n):
        if left[i] > 0 and right[i] > 0:
            ans[i] = min(left[i], right[i])
        elif left[i] > 0:
            ans[i] = left[i]
        elif right[i] > 0:
            ans[i] = right[i]
    
    return ans

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def solve(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = test_cases[_][0]
        a = test_cases[_][1]
        results.append(min_time_to_be_eaten(a))
    return results

# Example usage
t = 4
test_cases = [
    (4, [3, 2, 4, 2]),
    (3, [1, 2, 3]),
    (5, [2, 2, 3, 1, 1]),
    (7, [4, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 8])
]

results = solve(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(*result)
```

This corrected version uses a stack to efficiently calculate the minimum time for each slime to be eaten from both the left and the right. It then combines these results to determine the overall minimum time for each slime to be eaten.
