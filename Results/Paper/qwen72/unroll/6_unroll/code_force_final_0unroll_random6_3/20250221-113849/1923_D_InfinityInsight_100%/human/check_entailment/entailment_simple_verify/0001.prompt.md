You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a line of slimes, each with a specific size.
   - Every second, a slime can eat one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger than the neighbor.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes a list `a` and an integer `x`.
     - It returns the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x` using binary search (`bisect_left`).
     - If `x` is not found in `a`, it returns the index where `x` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
     - The function then adjusts the index by 1 to account for the 0-based indexing and returns it.
     - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function takes a list `a` and an integer `n`.
     - It initializes `left` and `last` lists to keep track of cumulative sums and the last index of a different size slime, respectively.
     - It also initializes `ans` with -1 for each slime, indicating that initially, all slimes are assumed to be impossible to be eaten.
     - It iterates through the slimes to update the `last` list, which keeps track of the last index of a slime with a different size.
     - It then iterates through the slimes again to calculate the minimum time each slime can be eaten:
       - If the current slime `a[i]` is smaller than the previous slime `a[i-1]`, it sets `ans[i]` to 1 because the previous slime can eat it immediately.
       - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the cumulative sum of sizes up to the current slime minus the size of the current slime minus 1.
       - It uses `func_1` to find the index `inx` of the first slime that has a cumulative sum greater than or equal to `x`.
       - It also uses `last` to find the index `inx2` of the last slime with a different size before the current slime.
       - If `inx2` is less than `inx`, it updates `inx` to `inx2`.
       - If `inx` is valid (not -1), it updates `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where a slime is immediately eaten by a larger neighbor.
   - The use of cumulative sums and binary search helps in efficiently finding the minimum time a slime can be eaten.
   - The `last` list ensures that the program considers the last slime with a different size, which is crucial for the correct calculation of the minimum time.
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where it is impossible for a slime to be eaten.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given problem description and constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
