Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` which is updated based on the conditions: for each index `i` where `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1; for each index `i` where `a[i] >= a[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the minimum of `func_1(left, x)` and `last[i - 1]`, and `inx` is non-negative.**
