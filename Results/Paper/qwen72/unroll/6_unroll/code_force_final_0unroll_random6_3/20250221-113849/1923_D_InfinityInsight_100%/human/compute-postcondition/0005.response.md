The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` is not empty (i.e., it contains at least one element), the loop will execute. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `a` during the first iteration.

State: **`a` must be a non-empty list, `i` is the first element in `a`, `n` remains unchanged, `left` remains a list containing the integer 0, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the value `a[i]` before a different value appears, `ans` remains a list of length `n` where each element is -1**
