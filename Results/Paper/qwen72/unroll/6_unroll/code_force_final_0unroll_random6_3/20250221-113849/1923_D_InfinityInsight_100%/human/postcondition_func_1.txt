The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of the same length as `a`, where each element `ans[i]` is determined as follows: If `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, then `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the minimum of the index returned by `func_1(left, x)` and the last occurrence index of `a[i - 1]` before a different value appears in `a`. If `inx` is negative, `ans[i]` remains -1. The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `n`.
