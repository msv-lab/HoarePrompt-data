### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` and then reads the `n` rows of the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is responsible for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It initializes the first element of the row to 1 and adds 2 to the first `d` elements (excluding the first element).
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within a sliding window of size `d`.
   - For each element from `d` to the end of the row, it updates the cost of installing a support based on the minimum cost in the heap and the current depth of the cell.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell in the row, which is the total cost of installing supports for that row.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the entire grid for a single test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of installing supports for that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost of installing `k` consecutive bridges by summing up the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum of these total costs.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints, such as the first and last columns being 0.
   - The sliding window mechanism ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm for `func_1` ensures that the cost of installing supports is minimized by always choosing the minimum cost within the sliding window.
   - The algorithm for `func_2` correctly sums the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the use of a min-heap ensures that the minimum cost is always chosen for the sliding window mechanism.

### Correctness:
**True**
