Functionality: **The function does not take any parameters but reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, where `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges, and `d` is the maximum distance between supports. The function also reads `n` rows of `m` integers each, forming a 2D list `rows` where each element `rows[i][j]` represents the depth of the river cell. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.**
