To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to run.

### Loop Head Analysis:
The loop head is:
```
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
```
- `i` is the loop variable.
- `len(costs)` is the length of the `costs` list.
- `k` is a specific integer provided by the input.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute if `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is greater than 0.
- This can be simplified to `len(costs) >= k`.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are specific integers provided by the input.
- `rows` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns.
- `rows[i][1]` and `rows[i][m]` are 0 for all `i` in the range [0, n-1].
- `costs` is a list of integers where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to each row of `rows` with the argument `d`.
- `total_costs` is an empty list.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0.

### Final State:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain as specific integers provided by the input.
- `rows` remains a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns.
- `rows[i][1]` and `rows[i][m]` are 0 for all `i` in the range [0, n-1].
- `costs` must have at least `k` elements.
- `i` is 0.
- `total_costs` remains an empty list.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are specific integers provided by the input, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `rows[i][1]` and `rows[i][m]` are 0 for all `i` in the range [0, n-1], `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, `i` is 0, `total_costs` is an empty list**
