You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

#Function 1:

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, where `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges, and `d` is the maximum distance between supports. It then reads `n` rows of `m` integers each, forming a 2D list `rows` where each element `rows[i][j]` represents the depth of the river cell. The function computes the cost for each row using the function `func_1` and stores these costs in a list `costs`. It calculates the sum of `k` consecutive costs for all possible segments in `costs` and stores these sums in a list `total_costs`. Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than d.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell (i, j) is \(a_{i,j} + 1\).

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports for a single row.
   - It initializes the first cell with a cost of 1 (since \(a_{i,1} = 0\)).
   - It then iterates through the first d cells, setting their costs to \(a_{i,j} + 2\) (since the first support is already placed at the first column).
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within the last d+1 cells.
   - For each cell beyond the first d cells, it pops the minimum cost from the heap that is within the valid range (i.e., the distance from the current cell is no more than d).
   - It updates the cost of the current cell by adding the minimum cost from the heap and the cost of the current cell plus 1.
   - It pushes the updated cost and the current cell index back into the heap.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the minimum cost to install supports for the entire row.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input for each test case, including the dimensions of the grid (n, m), the number of bridges (k), and the maximum distance between supports (d).
   - It reads the grid values for each row.
   - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building k consecutive bridges by summing the costs of k consecutive rows.
   - It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of k consecutive rows.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the installation of supports for a single row, ensuring that the first and last columns always have supports.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and calculates the minimum total cost for k consecutive bridges.
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the algorithm efficiently finds the minimum cost for each cell, considering the constraint on the maximum distance between supports.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity for `func_1` is \(O(m \log d)\), where m is the number of columns and d is the maximum distance between supports.
   - The time complexity for `func_2` is \(O(t \cdot n \cdot m \log d)\), where t is the number of test cases, n is the number of rows, and m is the number of columns.
   - This complexity is efficient given the constraints.
