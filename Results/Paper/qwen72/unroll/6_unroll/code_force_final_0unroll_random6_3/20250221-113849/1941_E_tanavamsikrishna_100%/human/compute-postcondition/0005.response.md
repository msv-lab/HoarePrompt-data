Output State: **`total_costs` is a list of integers where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, starting from the first element up to the element that allows `k` consecutive elements to be summed. The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs` remain unchanged.**
