### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct or not.

#### Function 1: `func_1(row, d)`
1. **Initialization:**
   - `row[0] = 1`: This sets the cost of the first support to 1.
   - `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2`: This adds 2 to the cost of each cell from index 1 to `d-1` to account for the support cost and the depth.

2. **Min-Heap Construction:**
   - `min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]`: This creates a min-heap of the first `d` elements of the row.
   - `heapify(min_heap)`: This converts the list into a min-heap.

3. **Dynamic Programming with Min-Heap:**
   - `for i in range(d, len(row))`: This loop iterates over the remaining elements of the row.
   - `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`: This removes elements from the heap that are no longer within the valid window of `d` elements.
   - `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`: This updates the cost of the current cell `i` by adding the minimum cost from the heap, the depth of the current cell, and 1 for the support.
   - `heappush(min_heap, e)`: This re-inserts the minimum element back into the heap.
   - `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))`: This adds the updated cost of the current cell to the heap.

4. **Return Value:**
   - `return row[-1]`: This returns the cost of the last support, which is the total cost for the row.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
1. **Input Reading:**
   - `n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))`: This reads the number of rows, columns, bridges, and maximum distance.
   - `rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]`: This reads the grid of depths.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - `costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]`: This calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - `total_costs = []`: This initializes a list to store the total costs for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`: This iterates over the possible starting rows for the bridges.
   - `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))`: This calculates the total cost for `k` consecutive rows and appends it to `total_costs`.

4. **Output:**
   - `print(min(total_costs))`: This prints the minimum total cost from `total_costs`.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where `d` is greater than or equal to `m`. According to the problem description, the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`, and the distance between supports `(i, j1)` and `(i, j2)` is `|j1 - j2| - 1`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program should still be able to place supports only at the river banks and calculate the correct cost.

### Analysis:
1. **Handling `d >= m`:**
   - When `d` is greater than or equal to `m`, the distance between the first and last support is `m - 2`, which is always less than or equal to `d` (since `d >= m` and `m - 2 <= m - 1 <= d`).
   - In this case, the program should place supports only at the river banks (first and last columns) and calculate the cost accordingly.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not explicitly handle this case, but it does not need to because the loop `for i in range(d, len(row))` will not run if `d >= m` (since `d` is the starting index and `len(row)` is `m`).

2. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly initializes the first support cost and updates the costs for the first `d` elements.
   - The min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost within the window of `d` elements.
   - The dynamic programming approach ensures that the cost of each support is minimized based on the previous supports.

3. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function reads the input correctly.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the case where `d` is greater than or equal to `m` because the loop in `func_1` that updates the costs for the remaining elements does not run in this case. The program will place supports only at the river banks and calculate the correct cost.

Therefore, the original assessment is **inaccurate**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
