Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user. It modifies `a` by incrementing each element `a[i]` by `i + 1`. The function then ensures that the final list `ans` has exactly `n` elements, where the elements are the unique, sorted (in descending order) modified elements of `a`, along with additional elements added to fill the list to length `n`. These additional elements are consecutive integers, each one less than the previous, starting from the last element of the sorted list minus one. The function prints the final list `ans` and does not return any value. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the function execution. **
