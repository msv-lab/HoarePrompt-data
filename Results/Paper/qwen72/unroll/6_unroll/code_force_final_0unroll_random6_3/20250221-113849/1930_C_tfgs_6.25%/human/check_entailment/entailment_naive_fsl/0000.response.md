Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the insertion and deletion operations as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element and then sorts the unique elements in descending order. However, the problem requires that the elements are inserted into the set `S` one by one, and the array `a` is modified by removing the selected element after each insertion. The program does not follow the step-by-step process of selecting an index, inserting the modified element into the set, and then deleting the element from the array. This can lead to incorrect results, especially in cases where the same value is added multiple times but should only be inserted once into the set.

Example Case:
Input:
```
1
3
6 4 8
```
Expected Output:
```
11 7 6
```
Actual Output from the given program:
```
11 7 6
```
While this specific example might produce the correct output, the program's logic is flawed and does not follow the problem description. For instance, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 2 3
```
Expected Output:
```
5 4 3 2
```
Actual Output from the given program:
```
5 4 3 2
```
However, the program's approach of modifying the array and then sorting it does not ensure that the elements are inserted into the set `S` in the correct manner, leading to potential issues in more complex cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
