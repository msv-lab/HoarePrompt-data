### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling the function `func_1()` for each one. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the array itself.
   - It then modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]`. This step is correct as it follows the operation described in the problem.

3. **Handling Unique Elements:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each element in the modified array `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the set in descending order. This step is necessary to ensure that the elements in `b` are unique and sorted in decreasing order.

4. **Constructing the Lexicographically Largest Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes `cnt` to `n - len(a)`, which represents the number of elements that need to be added to `ans` to make its length equal to `n`.
   - It iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a` and adds elements to `ans` to ensure the final length is `n`:
     - If the current element is not the first, it calculates the number of elements (`adv`) that can be added between the current and the previous element to maximize the lexicographical order.
     - It then adds these elements to `ans` and updates `cnt` and the `counter` accordingly.
     - Finally, it appends the current element to `ans`.

5. **Filling Remaining Elements:**
   - After processing all unique elements, the program appends the remaining elements to `ans` by decrementing the last element in `ans` and adding it to the list. This ensures that `ans` has exactly `n` elements.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` in the required format.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The algorithm correctly modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element.
- It ensures that the set `S` contains unique elements and constructs the array `b` by sorting these unique elements in descending order.
- The additional elements added to `ans` are calculated to maximize the lexicographical order of `b`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where the same element is added multiple times to the set `S` due to the `i + 1` operation. However, the use of a set and the `Counter` ensures that duplicates are handled correctly.
- The program correctly fills the remaining elements to ensure the final length of `ans` is `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It ensures that the final array `b` is lexicographically largest and contains exactly `n` elements.
