You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user. It modifies `a` by incrementing each element `a[i]` by `i + 1`. The function then ensures that the final list `ans` has exactly `n` elements, where the elements are the unique, sorted (in descending order) modified elements of `a`, along with additional elements added to fill the list to length `n`. These additional elements are consecutive integers, each one less than the previous, starting from the last element of the sorted list minus one. The function prints the final list `ans` and does not return any value. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Operation Simulation**:
   - The program simulates the operation of adding `a[i] + i + 1` to the set `S` for each element in the array `a`.
   - This is done by iterating over the array and modifying each element in place: `a[i] += i + 1`.

3. **Set and Counter**:
   - The modified array `a` is then converted to a set to ensure all elements are unique.
   - A `Counter` is used to keep track of the frequency of each element in the modified array.

4. **Sorting and Lexicographical Construction**:
   - The unique elements are sorted in descending order to form the array `b`.
   - The program then constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` by:
     - Iterating over the sorted unique elements.
     - For each element, it tries to add as many elements as possible that are just below the current element but not already in the set.
     - This is done using the `adv` variable, which calculates the number of such elements that can be added.
     - The elements are added to the `ans` list and the `Counter` is updated accordingly.

5. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After processing all unique elements, if there are still elements left to be added (tracked by `cnt`), the program adds the remaining elements in decreasing order starting from the last element in `ans`.

6. **Output**:
   - The constructed array `b` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Operation Simulation**:
  - The operation `a[i] += i + 1` is correctly applied to each element of the array.
  - This ensures that the elements inserted into the set `S` are unique and correctly calculated.

- **Set and Counter Usage**:
  - Using a set to ensure uniqueness and a `Counter` to track frequencies is appropriate for this problem.
  - The set conversion and sorting are done correctly.

- **Lexicographical Construction**:
  - The program correctly aims to construct the lexicographically largest array by trying to add as many elements as possible just below the current element.
  - The use of `adv` to calculate the number of such elements is logical and ensures that the array is constructed in the desired order.

- **Final Adjustments**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where there are still elements left to be added after processing all unique elements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem and construct the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning steps outlined above.
