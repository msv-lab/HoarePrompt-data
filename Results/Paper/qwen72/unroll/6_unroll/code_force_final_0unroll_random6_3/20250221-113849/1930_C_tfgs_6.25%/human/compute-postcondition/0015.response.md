To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations that lead to the final state of `ans`.

### Initial State:
1. **List `a`**: This list remains sorted in descending order.
2. **Values of `t` and `n`**: These values remain unchanged.
3. **Counter `counter`**: This contains the updated frequency count of the unique elements in the modified list `a` (with some elements possibly being reduced).
4. **Variable `cnt`**: This is equal to `n - len(a) - total number of elements added to `ans` that were not originally in `a`.
5. **List `ans`**: This list contains the original elements of `a` along with additional elements that were added to ensure the final length of `ans` is `n`. The additional elements appended to `ans` are consecutive integers, each one less than the previous, starting from the last element of `ans` minus one.

### Steps to Determine the Output:
1. **Original Elements of `a`**: The list `a` is sorted in descending order, so the elements in `a` are in decreasing order.
2. **Additional Elements**: The additional elements are added to `ans` to ensure its final length is `n`. These elements are consecutive integers, each one less than the previous, starting from the last element of `ans` minus one.
3. **Final Length of `ans`**: The length of `ans` is `n`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some concrete values to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `a = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` (sorted in descending order).
- Suppose `n = 10`.

Since `a` has 5 elements, we need to add 5 more elements to `ans` to make its length 10. The additional elements will be consecutive integers, each one less than the previous, starting from the last element of `a` minus one, which is `0`.

So, `ans` will be:
- Original elements: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
- Additional elements: `[0, -1, -2, -3, -4]`

Thus, `ans` will be `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4]`.

### General Case:
- The original elements of `a` are in descending order.
- The additional elements are consecutive integers, each one less than the previous, starting from the last element of `a` minus one.
- The final length of `ans` is `n`.

### Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` in a single line, separated by spaces. The elements will be the original elements of `a` followed by the additional consecutive integers.

Output: **[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4] (where the original elements of `a` are in descending order, and the additional elements are consecutive integers starting from the last element of `a` minus one, ensuring the final length of `ans` is `n`)**

If you provide specific values for `a` and `n`, I can give you a more precise output. However, based on the general description, the output will be as described above.
