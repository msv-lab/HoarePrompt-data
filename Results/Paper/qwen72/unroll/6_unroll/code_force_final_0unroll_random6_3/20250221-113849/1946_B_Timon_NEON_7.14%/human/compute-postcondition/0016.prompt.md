You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a list `total_max_segment` containing the sum of all positive integers in `arr`, the index of the last positive integer in `arr`, and `len(arr) - 1` if the length of `total_max_segment` is not 1. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, it returns `[-1]`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `total_max_segment` which contains the sum of all positive integers in `arr`, the index of the last positive integer in `arr`, and `len(arr) - 1` if the length of `total_max_segment` is not 1. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, it returns `[-1]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
