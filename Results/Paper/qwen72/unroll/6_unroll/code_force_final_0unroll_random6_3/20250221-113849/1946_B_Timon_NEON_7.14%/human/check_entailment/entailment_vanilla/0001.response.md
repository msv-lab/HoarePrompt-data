### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and an integer `k`.
   - We need to perform exactly `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, summing it, and inserting the sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - It is a simple and correct implementation for the modulo operation.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - However, there are several issues:
       - The `new_segment` list is initialized as an empty list, but it is used as if it were a list with two elements.
       - The `max_segment` list is initialized as `[0, 0]`, but it is updated in a way that does not always maintain the correct structure.
       - The `segments_variants` list is used to store potential segments, but it is not clear how these segments are used to determine the maximum sum.
       - The function returns a segment, but the problem requires the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, not a segment.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - This function is supposed to calculate the final answer based on the maximum sum of a subarray and the number of operations `k`.
     - However, the function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations.

3. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program as provided does not correctly solve the problem.
   - The `func_2` function is flawed and does not correctly identify the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - The `func_3` function is incomplete and does not perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The `func_2` function is incorrect, and the `func_3` function is incomplete. A correct solution would need to properly identify the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and then use this information to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.
