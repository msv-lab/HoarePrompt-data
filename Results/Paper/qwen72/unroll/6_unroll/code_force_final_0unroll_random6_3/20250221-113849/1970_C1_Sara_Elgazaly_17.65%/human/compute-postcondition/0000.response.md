Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` and `y` are input integers.** 

The tree is represented by a list of edges (u, v) and has exactly two leaves. The values of `x` and `y` are now integers provided by the user input.
