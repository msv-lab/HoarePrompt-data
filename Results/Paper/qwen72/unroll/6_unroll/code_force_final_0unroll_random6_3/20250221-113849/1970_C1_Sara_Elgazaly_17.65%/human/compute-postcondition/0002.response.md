The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x - 1` is greater than 0, which means `x` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it starts at 0 by default in the context of `range`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an input integer, `lst` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `_` is 0**
