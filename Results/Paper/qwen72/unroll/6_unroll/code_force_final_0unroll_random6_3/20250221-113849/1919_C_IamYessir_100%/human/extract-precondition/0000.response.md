Precondition: **The function `func` is intended to solve a problem with multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of the array a, and the array a itself, which contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
