Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards (`n`), the number of coins (`k`), and a list of integers (`a`) representing the number of cards of each type. For each test case, it calculates the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by spending the given number of coins and stores these results in a list `ans_list`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `ans_list` to the console, one per line. The final state of the program is that `ans_list` remains unchanged, and the values in `ans_list` have been printed to the console. **
