To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `t > 0`. The state right before the loop includes the following:

- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.
- The current working directory contains subdirectories with numeric names.
- `t` is an input integer.

The only variable in the loop head is `t`, and the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that it is positive for the loop to run at least once.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, the current working directory contains subdirectories with numeric names, and `t` must be greater than 0**
