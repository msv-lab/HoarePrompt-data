Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the placement of the condition that checks whether the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. This check should be performed inside the loop for each test case, but in the given program, it is placed outside the loop, causing it to only evaluate the last test case. This means that for all test cases except the last one, the program does not output any result, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the output format is incorrect. The program should print "Alice" or "Bob" (without the extra spaces) for each test case, but it prints "bob  " or "alice" with extra spaces.

To fix these issues, the condition should be moved inside the loop, and the output format should be corrected to match the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
