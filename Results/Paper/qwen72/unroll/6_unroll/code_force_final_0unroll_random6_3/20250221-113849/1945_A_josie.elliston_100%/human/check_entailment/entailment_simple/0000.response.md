### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Each introvert needs a tent by themselves.
   - Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (1, 2, or 3).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for calculating the minimum number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, we need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
   - If the remainder of `extroverts % 3` plus the number of `universals` is less than 3, it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts, and the function returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, the function returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents required.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is responsible for the overall calculation, including introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts, and `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` to get the total number of tents required.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `1 2 3`
     - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 2 (needs 1 tent with 1 universal)
     - Universals: 3 (2 used, 1 left)
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts + 1 universal) + 1 (remaining 2 universals) = 3
   - **Test Case 2**: `1 4 1`
     - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (needs 2 tents, but 1 extrovert will be left without 2 others)
     - Universals: 1 (not enough to fill the remaining spot)
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible)
   - **Test Case 3**: `1 4 2`
     - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (needs 2 tents, 2 extroverts + 1 universal in one tent, 1 extrovert + 1 universal in another tent)
     - Universals: 2 (both used)
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts + universals) = 3
   - **Test Case 4**: `1 1 1`
     - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 1 (needs 1 tent, but 2 others are required)
     - Universals: 1 (not enough to fill the remaining spots)
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible)
   - **Test Case 5**: `1 3 2`
     - Introverts: 1 (needs 1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 3 (needs 1 tent with 3 people)
     - Universals: 2 (2 left)
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts) + 1 (remaining 2 universals) = 3
   - **Test Case 6**: `19 7 18`
     - Introverts: 19 (needs 19 tents)
     - Extroverts: 7 (needs 3 tents, 2 extroverts + 1 universal in one tent, 2 extroverts + 1 universal in another tent, 2 extroverts + 1 universal in the third tent, 1 extrovert left)
     - Universals: 18 (3 used, 15 left)
     - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 3 (extroverts + universals) + 5 (remaining 15 universals) = 27
   - **Test Case 7**: `0 0 0`
     - No participants, so no tents are needed.
     - Total tents: 0
   - **Test Case 8**: `7 0 0`
     - Introverts: 7 (needs 7 tents)
     - Extroverts: 0 (no tents needed)
     - Universals: 0 (no tents needed)
     - Total tents: 7
   - **Test Case 9**: `0 24 0`
     - Introverts: 0 (no tents needed)
     - Extroverts: 24 (needs 8 tents)
     - Universals: 0 (no tents needed)
     - Total tents: 8
   - **Test Case 10**: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
     - Introverts: 1000000000 (needs 1000000000 tents)
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 (needs 333333334 tents)
     - Universals: 1000000000 (enough to fill the remaining spots)
     - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 333333334 (extroverts + universals) = 1333333334

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.
- The logic for determining the number of tents required for extroverts and universals is sound.
- The program correctly returns -1 when it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences.

**Correctness: **True****
