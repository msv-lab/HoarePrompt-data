Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a logical error in the way it determines the winner. The game is more complex than the program suggests, and the logic needs to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of coins in both wallets, as well as the number of moves each player can make.

Here is the correct logic to determine the winner:

1. **If both wallets have the same number of coins (`a == b`)**:
   - The player who starts (Alice) will always lose because the opponent can mirror the moves. After each turn, the number of coins in both wallets will be the same, and eventually, both will have 0 coins, and the starting player will be unable to make a move.

2. **If one wallet has 1 coin (`a == 1` or `b == 1`)**:
   - The player with 1 coin will always lose because they can only remove the coin and then the other player will have a non-empty wallet and can continue playing.

3. **If both wallets have more than 1 coin**:
   - The player with the even number of coins will always win if the other player has an odd number of coins. This is because the player with the even number of coins can always force the game into a state where the opponent has 1 coin, and then the opponent will lose.
   - If both players have an even number of coins, the player with the smaller number of coins will lose because the opponent can always mirror the moves until the smaller player is forced to have 1 coin.
   - If both players have an odd number of coins, the player with the larger number of coins will lose because the opponent can always force the game into a state where the larger player has 1 coin.

Let's correct the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1:
            if a > b:
                print('Bob')
            else:
                print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            if a > b:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')

```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **If `a == b`**: Bob wins because Alice will be forced to make a move that results in both wallets having 0 coins.
- **If `a == 1`**: Bob wins because Alice can only remove the coin and then Bob will have a non-empty wallet.
- **If `b == 1`**: Alice wins because Bob can only remove the coin and then Alice will have a non-empty wallet.
- **If both `a` and `b` are odd**:
  - The player with the larger number of coins will lose because the opponent can force the game into a state where the larger player has 1 coin.
- **If both `a` and `b` are even**:
  - The player with the smaller number of coins will lose because the opponent can mirror the moves until the smaller player is forced to have 1 coin.
- **If `a` is even and `b` is odd**:
  - Alice wins because she can always force Bob to have 1 coin.
- **If `a` is odd and `b` is even**:
  - Bob wins because he can always force Alice to have 1 coin.

This corrected program should now produce the correct output for the given problem.
