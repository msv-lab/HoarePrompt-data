**Reasoning:**

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array` and processes them.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program counts the total number of digits in the list of integers using `total_digits += len(item)`.
   - It uses `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in each integer and stores these counts in the `zeros` list.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It then calculates the total number of trailing zeros that can be subtracted from the total digit count by summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` list.
   - The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is used to determine if Sasha wins. This condition checks if the remaining number of digits after removing the trailing zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of an integer.
   - It iterates from the end of the string and increments a counter until it encounters a non-zero digit.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

**Issues:**
- The function `func_1` is called with a string representation of the integer, which is correct.
- The logic for determining the winner is based on the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros. However, the logic might be flawed because it does not consider the actual values of the integers after Anna's move and how they can be concatenated by Sasha.

**Correctness:**
- The program's logic for counting digits and trailing zeros is correct.
- However, the condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` might not accurately determine the winner in all cases. The game's rules involve reversing digits and concatenating integers, which can significantly change the values and the outcome.

Given the provided execution summary and the problem description, the program's logic for determining the winner is not entirely correct. The program does not account for the actual values of the integers after Anna's move and how they can be concatenated by Sasha.

**Correctness: False**
