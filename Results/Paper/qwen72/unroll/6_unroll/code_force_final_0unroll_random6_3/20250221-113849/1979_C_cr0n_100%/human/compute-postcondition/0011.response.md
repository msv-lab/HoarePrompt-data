Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. **N**: This is a variable that remains the same, but its value is not explicitly provided.
2. **vals**: This is a list of integers that remains the same, but its exact values are not provided.
3. **den**: This is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`.
4. **vprod**: This is a list where each element is the result of the original `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
5. **den**: It is stated that `den` is greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `vprod`**:
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is calculated as `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - For example, if `vals = [a, b, c]`, then `vprod = [den // a, den // b, den // c]`.

2. **Understanding `den`**:
   - `den` is the GCD of all the integers in `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`.
   - Let's denote the GCD of `vals` as `gcd_vals`.
   - Then, `den = gcd_vals - sum(vprod)`.

3. **Calculating `vprod`**:
   - Each element in `vprod` is `den // vals[i]`.
   - Since `den` is derived from `gcd_vals` and `sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0, the elements in `vprod` will be integers.

4. **Formatting the Output**:
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of `vprod` into a single string, with each element converted to a string and separated by a space.
   - For example, if `vprod = [1, 2, 3]`, the output will be `"1 2 3"`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the elements of the list `vprod`, each converted to a string and separated by a space. The elements of `vprod` are calculated as `den // vals[i]` for each element `vals[i]` in the list `vals`.

Since the exact values of `vals` and `den` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **" ".join([str(den // vals[i]) for i in range(len(vals))])** (where `den` is the GCD of all elements in `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`, and `vprod` is a list where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`).
