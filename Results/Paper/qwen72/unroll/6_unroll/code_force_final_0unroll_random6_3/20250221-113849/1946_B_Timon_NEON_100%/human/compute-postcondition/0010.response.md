Output State: `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments, and now includes an additional segment which is `max_segment` with the end index `len(arr) - 1` appended to it, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is the segment from `segments_variants` with the smallest starting index and length greater than 1.
