The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers, where each integer in the list satisfies the constraint -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr). The function returns a segment from `segments_variants` with the smallest starting index that is greater than the starting index of the current `total_max_segment` and has a length greater than 1. If no such segment exists, the function returns `[-1]`.
