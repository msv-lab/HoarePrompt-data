The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should operate with two positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. Since the output is not specified, we can infer that the function might return a value or values based on these parameters, but without further details, we cannot determine the exact return value.

Functionality: **The function operates with two positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, but the specific return value is not provided.**
