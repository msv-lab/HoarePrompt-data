You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation. The number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: The function `func` will have processed all test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed a permutation of the integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the permutation for that test case. The permutation is constructed such that the even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...) are filled with the largest odd numbers in descending order, and the odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...) are filled with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order. The loop variable `i` in the outer loop will have completed all iterations from 0 to t-1, and the inner loop variables `i` and `ind` will have completed their respective iterations for each test case. The variable `p` will have been reset to a new permutation for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided `n` values, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
