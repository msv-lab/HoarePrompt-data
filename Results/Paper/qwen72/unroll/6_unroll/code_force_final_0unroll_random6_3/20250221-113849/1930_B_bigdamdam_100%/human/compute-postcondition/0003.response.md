Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and prints a permutation of the integers from 1 to n. The permutation is constructed such that even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...) are filled with the largest odd numbers in descending order, and odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...) are filled with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state includes the printed permutations for each test case. The function does not return any value. **
