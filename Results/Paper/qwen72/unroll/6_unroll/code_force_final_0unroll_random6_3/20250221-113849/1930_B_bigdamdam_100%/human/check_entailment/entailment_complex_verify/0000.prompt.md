You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation. The number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: The function `func` will have processed all test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed a permutation of the integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the permutation for that test case. The permutation is constructed such that the even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...) are filled with the largest odd numbers in descending order, and the odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...) are filled with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order. The loop variable `i` in the outer loop will have completed all iterations from 0 to t-1, and the inner loop variables `i` and `ind` will have completed their respective iterations for each test case. The variable `p` will have been reset to a new permutation for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and prints a permutation of the integers from 1 to n. The permutation is constructed such that even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...) are filled with the largest odd numbers in descending order, and odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...) are filled with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state includes the printed permutations for each test case. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case when \( n \) is odd correctly. Specifically, the second loop that fills the odd indices does not start with the correct value for \( ind \). 

For example, consider \( n = 5 \):
- The first loop will set `p` to `[5, 0, 3, 0, 1]`.
- The second loop will start with `ind = 1 + 5 % 2`, which is `2`. It will then set `p` to `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

However, the correct permutation for \( n = 5 \) should be something like `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]` to ensure that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) satisfy \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

The issue lies in the initialization of `ind` in the second loop. It should be initialized to `1` if \( n \) is odd, and to `2` if \( n \) is even. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to potential invalid permutations for odd \( n \).
