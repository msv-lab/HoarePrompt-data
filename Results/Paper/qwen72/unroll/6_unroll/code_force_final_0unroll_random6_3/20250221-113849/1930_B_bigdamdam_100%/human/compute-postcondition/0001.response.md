Output State: **The function `func` will have processed all test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed a permutation of the integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the permutation for that test case. The permutation is constructed such that the even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...) are filled with the largest odd numbers in descending order, and the odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...) are filled with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order. The loop variable `i` in the outer loop will have completed all iterations from 0 to t-1, and the inner loop variables `i` and `ind` will have completed their respective iterations for each test case. The variable `p` will have been reset to a new permutation for each test case.**
