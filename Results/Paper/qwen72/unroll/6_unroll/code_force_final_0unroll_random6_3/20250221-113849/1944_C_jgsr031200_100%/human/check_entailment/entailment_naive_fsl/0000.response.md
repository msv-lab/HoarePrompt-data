Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, it does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, nor does it ensure that Alice and Bob are playing optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively. Instead, the program simply counts the number of unique elements in the array `arr` and prints the first index where the frequency of an element is either 0 or 1, which does not align with the game's rules.

A potential case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  0 1 2 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  4
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly prints 4, which is the MEX of the array `[0, 1, 2, 3]` after all elements have been added to `c`. However, the optimal play would result in a MEX of 1, as Alice and Bob would remove elements in such a way that the smallest non-negative integer missing from `c` is 1.
