The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 0 \le a_i < n \), and `n` is the length of the list `arr`. `freq` is a list of zeros with length \( n + 1 \). For the loop to be executed, `arr` must have at least one element, and `i` will be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 0 \le a_i < n \) and must have at least one element, `freq` is a list of zeros with length \( n + 1 \), `i` is the first element of `arr`**
