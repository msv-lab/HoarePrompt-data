Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem by calculating the MEX of the array `c` that is formed by Alice and Bob playing optimally. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` is called for each test case. Inside `func_1`, the program initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.

3. **Optimal Play Analysis**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The key observation is that if an element appears at least twice in `arr`, it can be ignored because Alice can always pick it on her turn, and Bob will pick the other instance on his turn, ensuring that it does not affect the MEX of `c`.
   - The program iterates through the frequency array `freq` to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once. If `freq[i]` is 0, it means `i` is not in `arr`, and if `freq[i]` is 1, it means `i` appears exactly once.

4. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The variable `cou` is used to count the number of unique elements that have appeared exactly once in `arr`.
   - The loop continues until `cou` reaches 2 (indicating that two unique elements have been found) or until a missing element (MEX) is found.
   - When `cou` reaches 2 or a missing element is found, the program prints the current index `i` as the MEX and breaks out of the loop.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally:
- Alice will always pick the smallest unique element that can help maximize the MEX.
- Bob will always pick the smallest unique element that can help minimize the MEX.

The program efficiently handles the constraints and correctly calculates the MEX for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
