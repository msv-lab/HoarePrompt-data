The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` where each integer is between 0 and the length of the list minus one, inclusive. It does not return a value. Instead, it prints the first index \( i \) where either the count of unique integers in `arr` reaches 2 or the frequency of the integer \( i \) is 0. If the loop completes without finding such an index, no output is produced.
