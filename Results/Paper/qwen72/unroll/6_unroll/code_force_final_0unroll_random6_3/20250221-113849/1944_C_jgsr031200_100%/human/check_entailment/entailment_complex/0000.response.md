Reasoning:

The problem statement requires us to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array `c`. The given program, however, does not directly simulate the game but instead tries to determine the MEX based on the frequencies of elements in the initial array `arr`.

Let's break down the logic in the function `func_1`:

1. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The program creates a frequency list `freq` where `freq[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`.
   - This is correct and necessary to understand the distribution of elements.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the indices from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
   - It counts the number of unique elements (`cou`) that appear exactly once in `arr`.
   - If `cou` reaches 2 or if `freq[i]` is 0, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

The logic of the program is flawed because it does not consider the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Specifically:

- **Optimal Strategy**:
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she will try to include as many distinct integers as possible in `c`.
  - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to prevent Alice from including certain integers in `c`.

- **Program's Logic**:
  - The program simply counts the number of unique elements and prints the first index where `cou` reaches 2 or `freq[i]` is 0.
  - This does not account for the strategic choices of Alice and Bob.

For example, consider the input `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`:
- The program will set `freq = [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]`.
- It will then iterate and print `2` because `freq[2]` is 0.
- However, the optimal game would result in `c = [0, 1]` with a MEX of 2, which is correct in this case, but the program's logic is not general enough to handle all cases.

Another example, consider the input `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`:
- The program will set `freq = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]`.
- It will then iterate and print `1` because `cou` reaches 2 at `i = 1`.
- However, the optimal game would result in `c = [0, 1, 2, 3]` with a MEX of 4, which is incorrect.

The program does not correctly simulate the game or consider the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
