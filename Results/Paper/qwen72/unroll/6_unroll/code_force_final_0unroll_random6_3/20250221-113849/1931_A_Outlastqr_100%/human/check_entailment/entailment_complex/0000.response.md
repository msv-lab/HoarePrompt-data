### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the encoded word.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The function uses a series of conditional statements to determine the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded to `n`.
   - The conditions are:
     - If `n > 52`, the word is constructed as the `(n-53)`-th letter of the alphabet followed by "zz".
     - If `27 < n <= 52`, the word is constructed as "a" followed by the `(n-28)`-th letter of the alphabet and "z".
     - If `n == 27`, the word is "aay".
     - Otherwise, the word is constructed as "aa" followed by the `(n-3)`-th letter of the alphabet.

3. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - The conditions are designed to handle the range of possible `n` values (3 to 78) and ensure that the word is lexicographically smallest.
   - For `n > 52`, the word is constructed to be the smallest possible word that sums to `n` by using the largest possible third letter "z" and the largest possible second letter "z".
   - For `27 < n <= 52`, the word is constructed to be the smallest possible word by using "a" as the first letter and the largest possible third letter "z".
   - For `n == 27`, the word "aay" is the smallest possible word that sums to 27.
   - For `n <= 27`, the word is constructed to be the smallest possible word by using "aa" as the first two letters and the `(n-3)`-th letter as the third letter.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the decoded word for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement. The decoding logic is also correct and ensures that the lexicographically smallest word is produced for each `n` value within the specified range.

Correctness: **True**
