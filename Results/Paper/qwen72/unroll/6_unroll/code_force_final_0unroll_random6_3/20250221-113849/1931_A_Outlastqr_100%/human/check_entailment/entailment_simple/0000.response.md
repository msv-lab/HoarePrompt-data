### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` is defined to handle the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading an integer `n` for each test case.

2. **Alphabet String:**
   - The `alphabet` string is correctly initialized to contain all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'.

3. **Word Construction Logic:**
   - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest word based on the value of `n` is as follows:
     - If `n > 52`, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This is because the maximum sum of indices for a word of the form `aXz` (where `X` is any letter) is 52 (26 + 26 + 1 - 1 = 52). Therefore, any `n` greater than 52 must be of the form `Xzz` where `X` is the letter corresponding to `n - 52`.
     - If `n > 27`, the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This is because the maximum sum of indices for a word of the form `aaX` (where `X` is any letter) is 27 (26 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 27). Therefore, any `n` greater than 27 but less than or equal to 52 must be of the form `aXz` where `X` is the letter corresponding to `n - 27`.
     - If `n == 27`, the word is constructed as `'aay'`. This is the special case where the sum of indices is exactly 27, and the smallest lexicographical word is `aay`.
     - If `n <= 26`, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. This is because the smallest possible sum of indices for a word of the form `aaX` is 3 (1 + 1 + 1 = 3). Therefore, any `n` less than or equal to 26 must be of the form `aaX` where `X` is the letter corresponding to `n - 2`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the constructed word for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `24`
  - Expected Output: `aav`
  - Calculation: `24 - 3 = 21`, which corresponds to the letter 'v'. Therefore, the word is `aav`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `70`
  - Expected Output: `rzz`
  - Calculation: `70 - 52 = 18`, which corresponds to the letter 'r'. Therefore, the word is `rzz`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3`
  - Expected Output: `aaa`
  - Calculation: `3 - 3 = 0`, which corresponds to the letter 'a'. Therefore, the word is `aaa`.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `55`
  - Expected Output: `czz`
  - Calculation: `55 - 52 = 3`, which corresponds to the letter 'c'. Therefore, the word is `czz`.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `48`
  - Expected Output: `auz`
  - Calculation: `48 - 27 = 21`, which corresponds to the letter 'u'. Therefore, the word is `auz`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest word for each given `n` within the specified range. The logic and conditions are appropriate and handle all edge cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
