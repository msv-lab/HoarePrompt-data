Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Case for \( n > 52 \)**:
   - The solution assumes that if \( n > 52 \), the word should be in the form of `Xzz`, where `X` is the letter at position \( n - 53 \). However, this is not always the smallest lexicographically. For example, if \( n = 70 \), the solution outputs `rzz`, but the correct smallest word is `qzz` (since \( 17 + 26 + 26 = 69 \) and \( 17 + 26 + 27 = 70 \)).

2. **Case for \( 27 < n \leq 52 \)**:
   - The solution assumes that if \( 27 < n \leq 52 \), the word should be in the form of `aXz`, where `X` is the letter at position \( n - 28 \). This is not always correct. For example, if \( n = 52 \), the solution outputs `azx`, but the correct smallest word is `ayz` (since \( 1 + 25 + 26 = 52 \)).

3. **Case for \( n = 27 \)**:
   - The solution correctly handles this case by outputting `aay`.

4. **Case for \( n \leq 27 \)**:
   - The solution assumes that if \( n \leq 27 \), the word should be in the form of `aaX`, where `X` is the letter at position \( n - 3 \). This is not always correct. For example, if \( n = 26 \), the solution outputs `aaz`, but the correct smallest word is `ayy` (since \( 1 + 25 + 26 = 52 \)).

To correctly solve this problem, a more systematic approach is needed to find the lexicographically smallest word. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import string

def smallest_word(n):
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    word = ''
    
    # Start from the smallest possible values for the three letters
    for i in range(26, 0, -1):
        for j in range(26, 0, -1):
            for k in range(26, 0, -1):
                if i + j + k == n:
                    word = alphabet[i-1] + alphabet[j-1] + alphabet[k-1]
                    return word

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(smallest_word(n))

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible combinations of three letters in reverse order to find the lexicographically smallest combination that sums to \( n \). This ensures that the smallest possible word is found for each test case.
