You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) representing the number of boxes, a string s of n characters where each character is '0' or '1' representing the initial state of the boxes, and a string f of n characters where each character is '0' or '1' representing the desired state of the boxes. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s1 = input()
        
        s2 = input()
        
        a1 = s1.count('1')
        
        a2 = s2.count('1')
        
        hd = a1 - a2
        
        res = abs(a1 - a2)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if hd > 0:
                hd -= 1
                continue
            if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The loop iterates t times, where t is the number of test cases. For each test case, the output is the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (s1) to the desired state (s2). The operations involve flipping a '1' to a '0' or a '0' to a '1'. The variable `res` holds this minimum number of operations for each test case, and it is printed after each iteration. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^5) representing the number of boxes, a string `s` of `n` characters ('0' or '1') representing the initial state of the boxes, and a string `f` of `n` characters ('0' or '1') representing the desired state of the boxes. It returns the number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` into the desired state `f` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
