Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^5) representing the number of boxes, a string `s1` of `n` characters ('0' or '1') representing the initial state of the boxes, and a string `s2` of `n` characters ('0' or '1') representing the desired state of the boxes. The function calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the desired state `s2` for each test case. The operations involve flipping a '1' to a '0' or a '0' to a '1'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
