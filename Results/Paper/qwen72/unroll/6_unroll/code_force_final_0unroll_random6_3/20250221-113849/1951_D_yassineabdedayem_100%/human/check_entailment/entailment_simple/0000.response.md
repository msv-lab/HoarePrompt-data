Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Base Case (n == k)**: 
   - If `n` equals `k`, the program correctly prints "YES" and then "1" followed by "1". This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall with price 1, and she will be left with 0 coins, which is a valid scenario.

3. **Special Case (n + 2 > k * 2)**:
   - If `n + 2 > k * 2`, the program prints "YES" and then "2" followed by `n - k + 1` and `1`. This condition is derived from the inequality `n + 2 > 2k`, which simplifies to `n > 2k - 2`. 
   - In this case, Bob can set up two stalls:
     - The first stall with price `n - k + 1` will allow Alice to buy exactly `k - 1` jewels, leaving her with `k - 1` coins.
     - The second stall with price `1` will allow Alice to buy the remaining `1` jewel, making the total `k` jewels.
   - This is a valid solution because it ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and the number of stalls is within the limit of 60.

4. **General Case (n + 2 <= k * 2)**:
   - If `n + 2 <= k * 2`, the program prints "NO". This condition is derived from the inequality `n + 2 <= 2k`, which simplifies to `n <= 2k - 2`.
   - In this case, it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints. If `n` is less than or equal to `2k - 2`, Alice cannot buy `k` jewels even if she buys the maximum number of jewels from the first stall and then buys one jewel from each subsequent stall.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly prints "YES" or "NO" followed by the required number of stalls and their prices in the specified format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as `n == k` and `n + 2 > k * 2` correctly.
   - It also correctly identifies when it is impossible to set up the stalls to meet the requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and handles all the specified cases as required.

Correctness: **True**
