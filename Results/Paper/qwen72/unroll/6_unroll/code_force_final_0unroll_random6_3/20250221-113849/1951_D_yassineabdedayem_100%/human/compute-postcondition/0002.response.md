Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged. The loop has printed 'YES' followed by 1 and 1 if `n` equals `k`, or 'YES' followed by 2 and the values of `n - k + 1` and 1 if `n + 2 > k * 2`, or 'NO' if neither condition is met, for each of the `t` test cases.**
