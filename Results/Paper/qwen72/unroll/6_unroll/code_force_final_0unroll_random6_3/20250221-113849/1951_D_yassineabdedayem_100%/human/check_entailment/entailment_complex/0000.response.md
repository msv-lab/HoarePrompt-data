Reasoning:

The program attempts to solve the problem by considering a few specific cases where Bob can set up stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly handles the requirements:

1. **Case 1: `n == k`**  
   - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
   - The program correctly prints "YES" followed by 1 (the number of stalls) and 1 (the price per jewel for that stall).

2. **Case 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**  
   - This condition simplifies to `n > 2k - 2`.
   - If this condition is true, the program sets up two stalls: one with a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel and another with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall (since she has `n` coins and the price is `n - k + 1`, she can buy `k - 1` jewels and will be left with `k - 1` coins).
   - Then, she will buy 1 jewel from the second stall (since the price is 1 coin per jewel, she can buy 1 jewel with the remaining `k - 1` coins).
   - This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels in total.
   - The program correctly prints "YES" followed by 2 (the number of stalls) and the prices `n - k + 1` and 1.

3. **Case 3: Neither of the above conditions is true**  
   - If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2 <= k * 2`, the program prints "NO".
   - This condition implies that `n <= 2k - 2`.
   - If `n <= 2k - 2`, it is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels because even if Bob sets up the most expensive stall possible (with a price of `n` coins per jewel), Alice would still have more than `k - 1` coins left, which would allow her to buy more than `k` jewels.

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **Example 1: `n = 7`, `k = 3`**  
  - `n == k` is false.
  - `n + 2 > k * 2` is true (7 + 2 > 3 * 2).
  - The program prints "YES" followed by 2 and the prices `5` and `1`.
  - Alice buys 1 jewel from the first stall (7 - 5 = 2 coins left) and 2 jewels from the second stall (2 - 1 * 2 = 0 coins left).
  - Alice buys exactly 3 jewels, which is correct.

- **Example 2: `n = 6`, `k = 4`**  
  - `n == k` is false.
  - `n + 2 > k * 2` is false (6 + 2 <= 4 * 2).
  - The program prints "NO".
  - This is correct because Alice cannot buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins under the given constraints.

- **Example 3: `n = 255`, `k = 8`**  
  - `n == k` is false.
  - `n + 2 > k * 2` is true (255 + 2 > 8 * 2).
  - The program prints "YES" followed by 2 and the prices `248` and `1`.
  - Alice buys 1 jewel from the first stall (255 - 248 = 7 coins left) and 7 jewels from the second stall (7 - 1 * 7 = 0 coins left).
  - Alice buys exactly 8 jewels, which is correct.

The program correctly handles all the given examples and the conditions specified in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
