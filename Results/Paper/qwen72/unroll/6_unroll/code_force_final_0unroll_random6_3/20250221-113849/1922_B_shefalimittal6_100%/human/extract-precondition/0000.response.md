Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, the number of sticks `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the exponents of the stick lengths. The inputs should satisfy the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with the additional constraint that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.**

For a more accurate function definition, it should look like this:
```
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    # t is the number of test cases
    # test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains n and a list of integers a
```
