### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the formation of non-degenerate triangles correctly. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` reads all input at once and processes it in a loop. This is generally fine for the given constraints.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - The program uses a list `v` to count the occurrences of each exponent `a_i`. This is a valid approach for counting the number of sticks of each length.

3. **Triangle Formation Logic**:
   - The program only considers combinations where the same stick length is used multiple times. Specifically, it counts:
     - The number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length.
     - The number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length.
   - However, this logic is insufficient to form a non-degenerate triangle. For a triangle to be non-degenerate, the lengths of the sticks must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem: the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - **First Test Case**: All sticks have the same length `2^1 = 2`. Any three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle, so the output `35` is correct.
   - **Second Test Case**: The stick lengths are `2^3 = 8`, `2^2 = 4`, `2^1 = 2`, and `2^3 = 8`. The program correctly identifies that the combinations `(8, 4, 8)` and `(8, 2, 8)` can form a non-degenerate triangle, so the output `2` is correct.
   - **Third Test Case**: The stick lengths are `2^1 = 2`, `2^2 = 4`, and `2^3 = 8`. The program outputs `0` because it does not consider the combination `(2, 4, 8)`, which cannot form a non-degenerate triangle. However, the correct approach should also consider other combinations, such as `(2, 2, 3)`, which are not possible with the given lengths.
   - **Fourth Test Case**: Only one stick of length `2^1 = 2`. The program correctly outputs `0` because it is impossible to form a triangle with a single stick.

5. **Missing Logic**:
   - The program does not consider combinations of different stick lengths. For example, in the third test case, the program should check if any combination of three different stick lengths can form a non-degenerate triangle. The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible combinations of three different exponents and checking the triangle inequality theorem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it only counts combinations where the same stick length is used multiple times, which is not sufficient to form a non-degenerate triangle. The correct approach should consider all possible combinations of three sticks and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.
