You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case. The loop has finished executing, and the values of `t` and `n` are unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required.

2. **Special Character Check**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2:`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters must come in pairs (e.g., "AA", "BB").
   - If `n` is even, it proceeds to construct the string.

3. **String Construction**:
   - The program constructs the string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors (the other 'A' in the pair "AA").
   - The length of the string `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for `1 <= n <= 50` because the maximum value of `n` is 50, and `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`.
   - Since the length of `s` is always less than 200 for the given constraints, the program will always print 'YES' and the string `s` when `n` is even.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the constraints and problem requirements. It ensures that the string has exactly `n` special characters and that the length of the string is within the allowed limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
