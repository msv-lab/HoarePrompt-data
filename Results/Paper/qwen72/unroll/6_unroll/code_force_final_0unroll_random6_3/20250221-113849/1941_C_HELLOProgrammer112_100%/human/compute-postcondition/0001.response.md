Output State: **The loop will execute t times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer a and a string s from the input. The variables x, y, and z will be calculated as the counts of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in s, respectively. The loop will print the value of x + y - z for each test case. After all iterations, the values of t and s_list will remain unchanged, and the variables a, s, x, y, and z will be undefined or reset for each new test case.**
