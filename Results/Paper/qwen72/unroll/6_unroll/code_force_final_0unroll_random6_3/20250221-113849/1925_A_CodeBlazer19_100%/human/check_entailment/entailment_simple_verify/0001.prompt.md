You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has read a pair of integers `n` and `k` from the input, and printed the first `k` letters of the English alphabet repeated `n` times. The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values of the last pair of integers read from the input. The variable `t` will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. The goal is to find the shortest possible string `s` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `k`.

3. **String Construction**:
   - The program constructs the string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - For example, if `k = 3` and `n = 2`, the program will generate the string `'abcbac'`.

4. **Subsequence Verification**:
   - The constructed string `s` is of the form `('a' to 'k') * n`.
   - This means that `s` will contain each of the first `k` characters repeated `n` times.
   - Any string of length `n` using the first `k` characters can be formed as a subsequence by selecting the appropriate characters from the repeated blocks.

5. **Shortest String**:
   - The length of the constructed string `s` is `k * n`.
   - This length is the smallest possible length that can contain all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters as subsequences.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`, the string `s` will be the first `k` characters repeated once, which is the correct and shortest possible string.
   - For `k = 1`, the string `s` will be the same character repeated `n` times, which is the correct and shortest possible string.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `s` will be `'abab'`, which is a valid and shortest possible string containing all subsequences of length 2 using the first 2 characters.

7. **General Case**:
   - For any `n` and `k`, the string `s` will be of the form `('a' to 'k') * n`, which ensures that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters are subsequences of `s`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by generating the shortest possible string `s` that contains all required subsequences.
