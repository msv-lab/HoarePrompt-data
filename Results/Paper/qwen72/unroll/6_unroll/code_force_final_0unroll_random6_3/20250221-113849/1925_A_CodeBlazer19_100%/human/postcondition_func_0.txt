The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`. The function then prints a string consisting of the first `k` letters of the English alphabet repeated `n` times for each test case. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variables `n` and `k` will hold the values of the last pair of integers read from the input.
