Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the way it calculates the minimum cost when the number of yogurts `A` is odd. Specifically, the program prints the value of `X` (which is `A // 2`) and then calculates the cost as `X * C + B`. This is incorrect because it should directly print the total cost without printing `X`.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

This version correctly calculates the minimum cost for both even and odd values of `A`. For odd values of `A`, it calculates the cost for `A // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and adds the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price.
