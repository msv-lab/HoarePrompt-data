Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `x` from the input, where `2 <= x <= 1000`. It then calculates `x - 1` and prints this value. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values `t` and `x` are no longer relevant, and the program has printed `t` lines, each containing the value of `x - 1` for the corresponding test case. **
