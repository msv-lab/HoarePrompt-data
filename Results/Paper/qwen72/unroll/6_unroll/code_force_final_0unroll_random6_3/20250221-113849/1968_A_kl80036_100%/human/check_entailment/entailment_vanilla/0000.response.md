### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an integer \( x \) and need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function \( \gcd(x, y) \) is the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The greatest common divisor \( \gcd(x, y) \) of two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) is at most \( y \) when \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).
   - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \( \gcd(x, y) \) is either 1 (if \( x \) is prime or \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are coprime) or a small number (if \( x \) and \( x-1 \) share a common divisor).
   - In either case, \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) will be maximized when \( y = x - 1 \) because \( y \) is the largest possible value less than \( x \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \).
   - Finally, it prints \( y \).

4. **Verification:**
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 9 \) and \( \gcd(10, 9) = 1 \). So, \( \gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 6 \) and \( \gcd(7, 6) = 1 \). So, \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 20 \) and \( \gcd(21, 20) = 1 \). So, \( \gcd(21, 20) + 20 = 1 + 20 = 21 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 99 \) and \( \gcd(100, 99) = 1 \). So, \( \gcd(100, 99) + 99 = 1 + 99 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \) and \( \gcd(2, 1) = 1 \). So, \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 999 \) and \( \gcd(1000, 999) = 1 \). So, \( \gcd(1000, 999) + 999 = 1 + 999 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 5 \) and \( \gcd(6, 5) = 1 \). So, \( \gcd(6, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6 \).

   In all these cases, the program correctly outputs \( y = x - 1 \), which maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it always outputs \( y = x - 1 \), which is the optimal solution for maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

Correctness: **True**
