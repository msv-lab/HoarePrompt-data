Correctness: **True**

**Explanation:**

The given program attempts to solve the problem by choosing \( y = x - 1 \) for each test case. Let's analyze why this choice is correct:

1. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) where \( y = x - 1 \) is always 1. This is because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and the GCD of any two consecutive integers is 1.

2. **Expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\):**
   - Since \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) when \( y = x - 1 \), the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) simplifies to \(1 + (x - 1) = x\).

3. **Maximizing the Expression:**
   - The goal is to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Given that \( y \) must be in the range \(1 \le y < x\), the maximum value of \( y \) is \( x - 1 \). Therefore, the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is \( x \), which is achieved when \( y = x - 1 \).

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs \( y = x - 1 \) for each test case, which is a valid and optimal solution.

Thus, the program is correct and satisfies the problem requirements.
