To determine what will be printed by the `print(pergunta)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `pergunta` is the minimum value between the initial `pergunta` and the sum of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`.
   - `x` is the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

2. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - First, we need to calculate `x`.
     - `x` is the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
     - This means for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, we take the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and then sum these minimum values.
   - Next, we calculate the sum of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`.
     - This means for each index `i` from `0` to `m-1`, we add `x` to `a[i]` and then sum these results.
   - Finally, `pergunta` is the minimum value between the initial `pergunta` and the sum calculated in the previous step.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The exact value of `pergunta` depends on the initial value of `pergunta` and the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`.
   - Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `pergunta`.
   - However, we can describe the value of `pergunta` in terms of the given variables and conditions.

Output: **pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value between the initial pergunta and the sum of x + a[i] for all i < m, and x is the sum of the minimum values between a[i] and b[i] for all i from n-1 to 0)**
