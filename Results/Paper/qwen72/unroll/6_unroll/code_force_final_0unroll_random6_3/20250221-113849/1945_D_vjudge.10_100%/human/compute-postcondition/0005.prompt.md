You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a and b are lists of integers of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), where each element a_i and b_i satisfies (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), and n and m are integers such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: pergunta is the minimum value between the initial pergunta and the sum of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`. `x` is the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`. The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value between the initial pergunta and the sum of x + a[i] for all i < m, and x is the sum of the minimum values between a[i] and b[i] for all i from n-1 to 0)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `pergunta` representing the number of test cases, two lists of integers `a` and `b` of length `n`, and two integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. The function returns a result based on the input parameters and the constraints provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
