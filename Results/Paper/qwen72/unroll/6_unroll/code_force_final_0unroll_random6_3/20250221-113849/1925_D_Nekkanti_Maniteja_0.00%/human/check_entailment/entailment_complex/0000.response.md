### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively.
   - It initializes `M` to \(10^9 + 7\) for the modulo operation.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct because \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) is the number of possible pairs of children, and `c` is used to normalize the probability of selecting a pair.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The function reads `m` lines of input, each containing the indices of a pair of friends and their initial friendship value `f_i`.
   - It sums up all the initial friendship values `f_i` into the variable `a`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The function then iterates `k` times to simulate each excursion.
   - For each excursion, it updates `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` is intended to account for the increase in friendship value for each pair of friends selected in the current excursion. However, this term is incorrect because it does not correctly model the expected increase in friendship value.
   - The term `c * a` correctly accounts for the initial friendship values of the pairs of friends.

4. **Expected Value Formula:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen over `k` excursions can be derived as follows:
     - The probability of selecting any specific pair of friends is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
     - The expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends in each excursion is \( \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
     - The total expected increase in friendship value for all pairs of friends in each excursion is \( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \).
     - The total expected increase over `k` excursions is \( k \cdot \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \).
     - The initial sum of friendship values is `a`.
     - Therefore, the total expected value is \( a + k \cdot \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \).

5. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The function correctly uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within the constraints.
   - The final result is printed as `s % M`.

### Correctness:
The function is **incorrect** because the term `c * i * c * m` in the loop does not correctly model the expected increase in friendship value. The correct term should be `c * 2 * m * k` to account for the total expected increase over `k` excursions.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        a = 0
        
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        s = a + c * 2 * m * k
        
        print(s % M)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
