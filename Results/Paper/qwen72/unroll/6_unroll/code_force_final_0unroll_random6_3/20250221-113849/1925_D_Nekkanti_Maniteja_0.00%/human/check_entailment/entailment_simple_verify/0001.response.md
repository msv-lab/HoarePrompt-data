### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of pairs chosen over `k` excursions.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value of a pair of friends chosen in each excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs plus the expected increase due to the chosen pairs.
   - The expected increase in the sum of friendship values for each excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times (i + a)\), where `i` is the current excursion number and `a` is the sum of initial friendship values.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - We need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) is used to compute the probability.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It calculates the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`.
   - It initializes `s` to store the expected sum and `a` to store the sum of initial friendship values.
   - It reads the initial friendship values and adds them to `a`.
   - It iterates over `k` excursions, updating the expected sum `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion.
   - Finally, it prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The calculation of the modular inverse is correct.
   - The expected increase in friendship values is correctly calculated as \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times (i + a)\).
   - However, the program has a logical error in the way it updates the expected sum `s`. Specifically, the term `c * i * c * m` is incorrect. The expected increase should be \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times (i + a)\), which simplifies to `c * (i + a) * m`.

7. **Corrected Calculation:**
   - The correct update for `s` should be:
     ```python
     s = s + c * (i + a) * m
     ```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identified the logical error in the program. The term `c * i * c * m` should indeed be `c * (i + a) * m` to correctly calculate the expected increase in friendship values.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
