Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**:
   - The probability of selecting a specific pair of friends is not correctly calculated. The program uses `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`, which is incorrect. The correct probability should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`, since there are `n * (n - 1) // 2` possible pairs of children.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The expected value calculation is flawed. The program uses `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, which is incorrect. The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship values due to the excursions.
   - The expected increase in friendship values for each excursion should be `c * m` (the probability of selecting a friend pair) multiplied by the number of excursions, not `c * i * c * m`.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is applied incorrectly. The expected value should be computed in a way that ensures the final result is correct modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        expected_increase = (c * m * k) % M
        total_expected_value = (a + expected_increase) % M
        print(total_expected_value)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the probability of selecting a friend pair and the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion. It also ensures that the final result is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
