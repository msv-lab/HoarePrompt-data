Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the variables `n` and `q` have been updated with new values from the input, `operations` has been updated with a new list of `n` operations, and `queries` has been updated with a new list of `q` queries. The `result` variable has been updated with the output of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` for each iteration, and the results have been printed. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` is reset for each iteration, so the final state of these variables is undefined after the loop completes.**
