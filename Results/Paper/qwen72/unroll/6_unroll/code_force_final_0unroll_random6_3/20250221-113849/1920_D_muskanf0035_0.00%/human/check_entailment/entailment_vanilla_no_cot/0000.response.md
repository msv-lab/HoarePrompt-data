Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the second type of operation (`b=2`) efficiently. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` in `func_1` will cause the program to run very slowly and potentially exceed memory limits for large values of `x` (up to \(10^9\)).

### Issues:
1. **Memory and Time Efficiency**: The program constructs the entire array `a` for each test case, which is not feasible for large values of `x` in the second type of operation. The array can grow exponentially, leading to memory and time constraints being exceeded.

2. **Handling Large Queries**: The program does not handle the large queries efficiently. For example, if `k` is very large (up to \(10^{18}\)), the program will not be able to access the `k`-th element directly from the array because the array will not be constructed to that size.

### Correct Approach:
To handle the problem efficiently, we need to simulate the operations without constructing the entire array. We can keep track of the size of the array and the elements added in a more compact form. For the second type of operation, we can use modular arithmetic to determine the position of the element in the repeated subarray.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    size = 0
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append((size, value))
            size += 1
        else:
            size *= value
        if size > 10**18:  # To prevent overflow
            size = 10**18

    for k in queries:
        k -= 1  # Convert to 0-indexed
        for (start, value) in reversed(array):
            if k < size:
                result.append(value)
                break
            else:
                k %= size
                size = start + 1
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Array Representation**: We store the operations in a list of tuples `(start, value)`, where `start` is the size of the array before the operation and `value` is the element added or the number of copies.
2. **Size Tracking**: We keep track of the size of the array after each operation.
3. **Query Handling**: For each query, we use modular arithmetic to find the correct element in the array. We iterate through the operations in reverse to determine the position of the element.

This approach ensures that we can handle large values of `x` and `k` efficiently without constructing the entire array.
