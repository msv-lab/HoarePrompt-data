### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `array` and an empty list `result`.
   - **Processing Operations**:
     - For each operation, if the operation type `op_type` is 1, it appends the integer `value` to the `array`.
     - If the operation type `op_type` is 2, it appends `x` copies of the current `array` to itself. This is done by extending the `array` with a list comprehension that iterates over the current `array` and appends each element `x` times.
   - **Handling Queries**:
     - For each query `k`, it appends the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the `result` list. This is because the array is cyclic, and the modulo operation ensures that the index wraps around if `k` exceeds the length of the array.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Reading Input**:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
     - It reads the operations and queries for each test case.
   - **Calling `func_1`**:
     - It calls `func_1` with the number of operations, the list of operations, and the list of queries.
   - **Printing Results**:
     - It prints the results of each test case.

### Issues:
- **Efficiency**:
  - The current implementation of `func_1` is inefficient for large values of `x` in the second type of operation. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is repeated `x` times, which can lead to a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case. This is not suitable for the constraints where `x` can be up to \(10^9\).
  - The array can grow very large, potentially exceeding memory limits.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **Initialization**:
  - The initial state of the program is correctly described. `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples, and `queries` is a list of positive integers.
- **Processing Operations**:
  - The first type of operation (appending an integer) is correctly implemented.
  - The second type of operation (appending `x` copies of the array) is implemented but is highly inefficient and can lead to memory issues.
- **Handling Queries**:
  - The queries are handled correctly using the modulo operation to ensure cyclic behavior.

### Correctness:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the inefficiency and potential memory issues with the original implementation of `func_1`.
- The revised function provided in the original assessment is a more efficient and correct approach to handle the problem within the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** for the original program.

Final: **False**
