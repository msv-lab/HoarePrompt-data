Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs the array `a` based on the operations provided.
   - For each operation of type 1, it appends the value to the array.
   - For each operation of type 2, it duplicates the array by extending it with its current elements, repeated `x` times.
   - After constructing the array, it processes the queries by returning the element at the position `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query `k`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the operations and queries.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the results.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly appends values for type 1 operations.
   - The function correctly duplicates the array for type 2 operations, but it only extends the array with its current elements once, not `x` times as required by the problem description.
   - The function processes the queries correctly by using the modulo operation to handle large indices.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the results.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The main issue is in `func_1` where the type 2 operations are not correctly implemented. The array should be extended `x` times, but the current implementation only extends it once.
   - This incorrect implementation will lead to incorrect results for test cases involving type 2 operations with `x > 1`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of type 2 operations in `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**
