Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the array are the same, but the array length is greater than 1. According to the problem description, if all elements are already the same, the cost should be 0. However, the program will output a non-zero value in this case because it does not properly account for the scenario where the entire array is already equal.

Example case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
5
2 2 2 2 2

Expected Output:
0

Actual Output:
3
```

In this case, the array is already equal, so no operation is needed, and the cost should be 0. However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 3.
