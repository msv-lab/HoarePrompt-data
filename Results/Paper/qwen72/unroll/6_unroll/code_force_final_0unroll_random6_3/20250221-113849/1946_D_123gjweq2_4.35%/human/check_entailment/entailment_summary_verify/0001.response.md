### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_k, r_k]` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of each segment is less than or equal to `x`.
   - The constraints and the bitwise operations suggest a bit-by-bit processing approach.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(arr, x)`**:
   - This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`.
   - The choice of `31` as the initial bit is appropriate because the highest bit we need to consider is the 30th bit (0-indexed), and starting from 31 ensures that all bits are processed.

3. **Function 2: `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
   - **Base Case**:
     - If `bit == -1`, it means we have processed all bits, and the length of `cur_arr` is returned as the result. This is correct because if all bits have been processed, the number of valid segments is the length of the array.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - Initialize `new_arr` to store the XOR results of segments.
     - Initialize `xor` to 0 to keep track of the current XOR segment.
     - Initialize `thing1` to 0 to store the result of the current bit processing.
     - Iterate through each element `i` in `cur_arr`:
       - Update `xor` with the current element.
       - Check if the current bit in `xor` is 0 (`if not xor >> bit & 1`):
         - If true, append `xor` to `new_arr` and reset `xor` to 0.
     - After the loop, check if the current bit in `xor` is 1:
       - If true, set `thing1` to -1 (indicating that the current segment cannot be split further).
       - If false, recursively call `find_max` on `new_arr` with the next bit (`bit - 1`).
     - Finally, check if the current bit in `x` is 1:
       - If true, return the maximum of the recursive call on the original array with the next bit and the length of `new_arr`.
       - If false, return `thing1`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `find_max` processes the array by splitting it into segments where the XOR of the segment does not set the current bit. This ensures that the segments are valid for the current bit.
   - It recursively processes the array bit by bit, ensuring that the XOR results of the segments are considered in decreasing order of significance.
   - The base case correctly returns the length of the array when all bits have been processed.
   - The recursive case correctly handles the splitting of segments and the comparison with the target `x`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is 0, the function correctly handles the case where no segments can be formed if any element in the array is non-zero. This is because the XOR of any non-zero element will set some bit, and the function will return -1 if any bit in the XOR result is 1.
   - If `x` is a large number, the function correctly processes all bits and ensures that the maximum number of segments is found.

6. **Function Summary Verification**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `find_max`. It correctly states that the function returns the length of `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1, processes the array to create `new_arr`, and handles the recursive calls and comparisons with `x` appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of each segment is less than or equal to `x`. The recursive approach ensures that the problem is solved bit by bit, and the base case and recursive calls are handled appropriately.

Final: **True**
