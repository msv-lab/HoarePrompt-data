Output State: **new_arr is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of elements in cur_arr until the bit position specified by bit is 0, xor is 0, and `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`. The bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the result of the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` to the variable `thing1`. The other variables (`new_arr`, `xor`, and `bit`) remain unchanged. The bit at position `bit` in `xor` is still 0.
