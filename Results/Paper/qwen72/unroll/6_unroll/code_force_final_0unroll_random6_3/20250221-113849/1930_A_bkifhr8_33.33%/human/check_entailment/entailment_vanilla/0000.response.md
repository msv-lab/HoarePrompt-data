### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers `lst`.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes the score `ans` to 0 for each test case.
   - It then reads the list of integers and splits it into a list `lst`.
   - The program iterates `n * 2` times, which is incorrect. It should iterate `n` times because each move involves selecting and removing two integers, and there are `2n` integers in total.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to add the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` to the score `ans`.
   - It then removes the first two elements from `lst` using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`. This is incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, respectively, which do not correctly index the elements to be removed.
   - The correct way to remove the first two elements is to use `lst.pop(0)` and `lst.pop(0)`.

4. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The program has a special case check `if len(lst) != 2:` which is unnecessary and incorrect. The loop should always handle the case where there are exactly two elements left.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly appends the final score `ans` to the list `ans_f` and prints the results for all test cases at the end.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        lst = [int(x) for x in lst]  # Convert the list of strings to a list of integers
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to ensure we always pick the smallest elements
        for i in range(n):
            ans += lst[0]  # Add the smallest element to the score
            lst.pop(0)  # Remove the smallest element
            lst.pop(0)  # Remove the next smallest element
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sorting**: By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest elements are always at the beginning. This allows us to always pick the smallest two elements in each move, which maximizes the score.
- **Correct Loop**: The loop now iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it adds the smallest element to the score and removes the first two elements from the list.
- **Conversion to Integers**: The list of integers is converted to integers before sorting and processing.

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical and indexing errors that prevent it from correctly calculating the maximum score.
- The corrected program addresses these issues and follows the correct approach to maximize the score.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
