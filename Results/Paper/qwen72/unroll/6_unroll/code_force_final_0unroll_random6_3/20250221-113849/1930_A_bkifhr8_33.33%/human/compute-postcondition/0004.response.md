The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `ans_f`. For the loop to execute, `ans_f` must be a non-empty list. The state of `i` will be automatically adjusted by the loop as it iterates over the elements of `ans_f`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 5000
- `n` is the last input integer where 1 <= n <= 50
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7
- `ans_f` is a list of `t` integers, each representing the sum of the minimum values of pairs from the corresponding input list `a`

To ensure the loop can execute, `ans_f` must have at least one element. Since `t` is the length of `ans_f` and `t` is at least 1, `ans_f` will have at least one element. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `ans_f` to ensure the loop can execute. However, we need to specify the state of `i` at the start of the loop, which will be the first element of `ans_f`.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the last input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is a list of `t` integers, each representing the sum of the minimum values of pairs from the corresponding input list `a`, `i` is the first element of `ans_f`**
