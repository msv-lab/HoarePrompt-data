You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers from the input. It then calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from the list and appends this sum to a list `ans_f`. After processing all test cases, it prints each integer in `ans_f`, where each integer represents the sum of the minimum values of pairs from the corresponding input list. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers `lst`.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes the score `ans` to 0 for each test case.
   - It then reads the list of integers and splits it into a list `lst`.
   - The program iterates `n * 2` times, which is incorrect. It should iterate `n` times because each move involves selecting and removing two integers, and there are `2n` integers in total.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to add the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` to the score `ans`.
   - It then removes the first two elements from `lst` using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`. This is incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, respectively, which do not correctly index the elements to be removed.
   - The correct way to remove the first two elements is to use `lst.pop(0)` and `lst.pop(0)`.

4. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The program has a special case check `if len(lst) != 2:` which is unnecessary and incorrect. The loop should always handle the case where there are exactly two elements left.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly appends the final score `ans` to the list `ans_f` and prints the results for all test cases at the end.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        lst = [int(x) for x in lst]  # Convert the list of strings to a list of integers
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to ensure we always pick the smallest elements
        for i in range(n):
            ans += lst[0]  # Add the smallest element to the score
            lst.pop(0)  # Remove the smallest element
            lst.pop(0)  # Remove the next smallest element
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sorting**: By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest elements are always at the beginning. This allows us to always pick the smallest two elements in each move, which maximizes the score.
- **Correct Loop**: The loop now iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it adds the smallest element to the score and removes the first two elements from the list.
- **Conversion to Integers**: The list of integers is converted to integers before sorting and processing.

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical and indexing errors that prevent it from correctly calculating the maximum score.
- The corrected program addresses these issues and follows the correct approach to maximize the score.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
