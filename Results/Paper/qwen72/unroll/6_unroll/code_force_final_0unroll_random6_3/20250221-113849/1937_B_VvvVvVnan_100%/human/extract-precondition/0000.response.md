Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input through a method that is not defined in the function signature, such as reading from standard input or a file. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of columns in a 2 × n grid, followed by two binary strings of length n, representing the values in the first and second row of the grid, respectively. The total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is provided at the beginning of the input, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
