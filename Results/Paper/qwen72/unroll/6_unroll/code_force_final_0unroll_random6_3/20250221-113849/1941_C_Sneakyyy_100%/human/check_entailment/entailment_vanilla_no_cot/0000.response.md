Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to count the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the program increments `i` by 3 whenever it encounters a substring "map" or "pie", and it increments `ans` by 1. This approach is incorrect because:

1. **Incrementing `ans` by 1**: When a substring "map" or "pie" is found, the program should increment `ans` by the number of characters that need to be deleted to remove the substring. However, the program only increments `ans` by 1, which is incorrect. For example, if the string is "mmapnapie", the program will output 2, but the correct answer should be 2 because you need to delete 2 characters to remove both "map" and "pie".

2. **Handling Overlapping Substrings**: The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "ppiepieeee", the program will only find "pie" once and increment `ans` by 1, but the correct answer should be 2 because you need to delete 2 characters to remove both "pie" substrings.

3. **Incorrect Increment of `i`**: Incrementing `i` by 3 when a substring is found skips over potential overlapping substrings. For example, in the string "mappppie", the program will only find "map" once and skip over the "ppp" part, missing the second "pie" substring.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you should:

- Use a more sophisticated approach to find and handle overlapping substrings.
- Count the number of characters that need to be deleted to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            if a[i:i+3] == 'map' or a[i:i+3] == 'pie':
                ans += 2  # Delete 2 characters to remove the substring
                i += 2    # Move to the next character after the deleted substring
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version increments `ans` by 2 whenever a substring "map" or "pie" is found, and it moves the index `i` by 2 to handle overlapping substrings correctly.
