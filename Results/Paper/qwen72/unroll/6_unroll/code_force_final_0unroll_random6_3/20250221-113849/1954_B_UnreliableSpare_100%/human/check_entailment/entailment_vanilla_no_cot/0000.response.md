Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling All Identical Elements**: The program correctly identifies when all elements are identical and prints `-1` in that case. However, the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove when the array is not all identical is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removals**: The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element (`arr[0]`). This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the broader requirement of making the array non-beautiful. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will incorrectly output `1` because it only checks the count of consecutive `1`s, but removing any single element from this array will still leave it beautiful.

3. **General Approach**: To make an array non-beautiful, you need to ensure that no valid operation can be performed. This means you need to break the pattern where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` for any `i` in the range `2 \le i \le n-1`. The program does not implement this logic correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if all elements are the same
    if len(set(arr)) == 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful
    min_removals = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if arr[i - 1] == arr[i + 1]:
            # Count the number of elements to remove to break this pattern
            removals = 0
            j = i
            while j < n - 1 and arr[j - 1] == arr[j + 1]:
                removals += 1
                j += 1
            min_removals = min(min_removals, removals)
    
    # If no pattern was found, the array is already non-beautiful
    if min_removals == float('inf'):
        print(0)
    else:
        print(min_removals)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
```

This corrected version:
- Checks if all elements are the same and prints `-1` if they are.
- Iterates through the array to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the pattern where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
- If no such pattern is found, it prints `0` because the array is already non-beautiful.
