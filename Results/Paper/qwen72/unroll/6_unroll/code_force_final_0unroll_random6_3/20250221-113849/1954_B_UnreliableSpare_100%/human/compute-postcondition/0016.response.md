The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts two parameters for each test case: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is a beautiful array as defined in the problem, and the constraints are `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Additionally, the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.

The function returns the result of processing each test case based on the provided list `a` and its length `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. For each test case, it processes the list `a` and returns the result of this processing.**
