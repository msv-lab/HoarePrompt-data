The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an integer input by the user, but it does not specify that `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
