The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, and then processes `t` strings, each of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. For each string `s`, if `s` contains more than one unique character, it prints 'YES' followed by a modified version of `s` (either the second half concatenated with the first half, the reverse of `s`, or a combination of the second half and the first character of the first half, depending on which modification is different from the original `s`). If `s` contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` strings, the function concludes. The function does not return any value.
