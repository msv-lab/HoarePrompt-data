The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and the array `a`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
