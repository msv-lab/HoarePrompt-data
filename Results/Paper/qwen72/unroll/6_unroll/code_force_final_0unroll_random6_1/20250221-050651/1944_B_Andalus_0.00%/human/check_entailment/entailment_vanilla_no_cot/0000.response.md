Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct in all cases:

1. **Handling of Single Occurrences in `lft` and `rgt`:**
   - The program incorrectly handles single occurrences of elements in the `lft` and `rgt` arrays. It appends elements to `sng` only if they are not equal to the next element and are not at the last position. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly identify all single occurrences.

2. **Output of Elements:**
   - The program prints elements directly without ensuring that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. It simply prints pairs of elements from `ldb` and `sng` without checking the XOR condition.

3. **Incorrect XOR Calculation:**
   - The program does not calculate the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` to ensure they are equal. It just prints elements based on the presence in `ldb` and `sng`.

4. **Potential Off-by-One Errors:**
   - The loop conditions and the way elements are added to `ldb` and `sng` might lead to off-by-one errors, especially when handling the last element in the sorted arrays.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you need to ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. One way to achieve this is to pair elements in `l` and `r` such that the XOR of each pair is zero. This can be done by selecting pairs of the same element from both `lft` and `rgt`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lft = lst[:n]
        rgt = lst[n:]
        
        # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each element in lft and rgt
        lft_count = {}
        rgt_count = {}
        
        for elem in lft:
            if elem in lft_count:
                lft_count[elem] += 1
            else:
                lft_count[elem] = 1
        
        for elem in rgt:
            if elem in rgt_count:
                rgt_count[elem] += 1
            else:
                rgt_count[elem] = 1
        
        l = []
        r = []
        
        # Pair elements that appear in both lft and rgt
        for elem in range(1, n + 1):
            if lft_count.get(elem, 0) > 0 and rgt_count.get(elem, 0) > 0:
                for _ in range(min(lft_count[elem], rgt_count[elem], 2)):
                    l.append(elem)
                    r.append(elem)
                    k -= 1
                    if k == 0:
                        break
            if k == 0:
                break
        
        # If k > 0, we need to find pairs of elements that can be XORed to zero
        if k > 0:
            for elem in range(1, n + 1):
                if lft_count.get(elem, 0) > 0 and rgt_count.get(elem, 0) > 0:
                    l.append(elem)
                    r.append(elem)
                    k -= 1
                    if k == 0:
                        break
        
        print(*l)
        print(*r)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Count Occurrences:**
   - We use dictionaries `lft_count` and `rgt_count` to count the occurrences of each element in `lft` and `rgt`.

2. **Pair Elements:**
   - We iterate through the elements from 1 to n and try to pair elements that appear in both `lft` and `rgt`. We ensure that we only pair up to 2k elements.

3. **Ensure XOR is Zero:**
   - If we still need more pairs (i.e., k > 0), we can pair elements that appear in both arrays to ensure the XOR condition is met.

This approach ensures that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal and that the elements are correctly selected from the given arrays.
