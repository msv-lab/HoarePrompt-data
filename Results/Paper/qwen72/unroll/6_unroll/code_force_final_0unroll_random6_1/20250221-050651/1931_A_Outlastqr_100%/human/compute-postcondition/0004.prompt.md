You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of integers, each representing the encoded word for a test case.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints a word based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 52, the word is the character at position `n - 53` in the alphabet string followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), the word is 'a' followed by the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet string and then 'z'. If `n` is 27, the word is 'aay'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), the word is 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet string. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it processes the corresponding `n` from the `test_cases` list and prints the resulting word. The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. It returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to an encoded word `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) from the `test_cases` list.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
