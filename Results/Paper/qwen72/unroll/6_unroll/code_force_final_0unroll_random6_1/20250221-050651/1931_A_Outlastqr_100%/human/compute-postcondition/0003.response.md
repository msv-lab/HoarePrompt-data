The function `func` should accept two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer represents the encoded word for a test case. The function returns a list of results corresponding to each test case, where each result is based on the encoded word `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. It returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to an encoded word `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) from the `test_cases` list.**
