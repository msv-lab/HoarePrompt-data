Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums to a given integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).
   - The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26.
   - The sum of the indices of the letters in the word should equal `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a 3-letter word based on the value of `n`.

3. **Breaking Down the Cases**:
   - **Case 1: `n > 52`**:
     - If `n` is greater than 52, the program constructs the word by adding the letter corresponding to `n - 53` to the string, followed by "zz".
     - This is because the maximum sum of two letters is 52 (26 + 26), so if `n` is greater than 52, the first letter must be at least `n - 52` to make up the difference.
     - For example, if `n = 70`, the first letter is `alphabet[70 - 53] = alphabet[17] = 'r'`, and the word is "rzz".

   - **Case 2: `n > 27`**:
     - If `n` is between 28 and 52, the program constructs the word by adding "a" as the first letter, the letter corresponding to `n - 28` as the second letter, and "z" as the third letter.
     - This is because the maximum sum of the first letter "a" (1) and the third letter "z" (26) is 27, so the second letter must be at least `n - 27` to make up the difference.
     - For example, if `n = 55`, the second letter is `alphabet[55 - 28] = alphabet[27] = 'c'`, and the word is "czz".

   - **Case 3: `n == 27`**:
     - If `n` is exactly 27, the program constructs the word "aay".
     - This is because the sum of "a" (1), "a" (1), and "y" (25) is 27, and "aay" is the lexicographically smallest word that can be formed.

   - **Case 4: `n < 27`**:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to 26, the program constructs the word by adding "aa" as the first two letters and the letter corresponding to `n - 3` as the third letter.
     - This is because the sum of "a" (1) and "a" (1) is 2, so the third letter must be `n - 2` to make up the difference.
     - For example, if `n = 3`, the third letter is `alphabet[3 - 3] = alphabet[0] = 'a'`, and the word is "aaa".

4. **Checking the Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 3 (smallest possible sum) and 78 (largest possible sum).
   - For `n = 3`, the word is "aaa".
   - For `n = 78`, the word is "zzz".

5. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program ensures that the constructed word is lexicographically smallest by always starting with "a" when possible and using the smallest possible letters to make up the remaining sum.

6. **Verification**:
   - The program's logic aligns with the problem requirements and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
