Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already not beautiful. For example, consider the input:

```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

The array [1, 2, 3, 4] is not beautiful because there are no indices \(i\) (2 ≤ \(i\) ≤ 3) such that \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\). According to the problem description, the output should be -1, but the program will output 1, which is incorrect. The program assumes that the array is always beautiful and tries to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make it not beautiful, without checking if it is already not beautiful.
