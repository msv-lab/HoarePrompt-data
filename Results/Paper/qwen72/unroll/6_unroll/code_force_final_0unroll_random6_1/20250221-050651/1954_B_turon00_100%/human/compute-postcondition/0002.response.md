Output State: The loop iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array `a` and stores this value in `ans`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` equals `n`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the value of `ans`. After all iterations, the final output state includes the results printed for each test case, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` are reset or updated for each test case as described in the loop. The loop completes execution after processing all `t` test cases.
