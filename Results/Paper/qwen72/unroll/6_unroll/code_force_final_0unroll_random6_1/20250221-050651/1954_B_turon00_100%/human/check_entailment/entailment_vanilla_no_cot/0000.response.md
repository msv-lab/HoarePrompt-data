Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func` is flawed as it tries to find the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element in the array. However, the problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, which involves a different approach.

A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly applying the operation described. To break this property, you need to ensure that no such operation can make all elements the same. This means you need to remove elements in such a way that the remaining array cannot be made uniform by the given operation.

Here is a corrected approach:

1. If the array has only one element, it is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so the answer is -1.
2. If the array has all elements the same, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, so the answer is -1.
3. Otherwise, the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is 1, because removing any element will break the pattern that allows the array to be beautiful.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(a)) == 1:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(1)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This code correctly handles the cases where the array is beautiful and determines the minimum number of elements to remove to make it non-beautiful.
