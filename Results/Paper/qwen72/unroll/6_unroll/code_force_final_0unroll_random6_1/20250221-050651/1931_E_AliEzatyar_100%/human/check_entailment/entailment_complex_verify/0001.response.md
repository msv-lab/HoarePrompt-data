### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It reads the list of integers `array` and splits it into individual strings.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to count the total number of digits in the list.
   - It also initializes an array `zeros` to store the number of trailing zeros for each integer.
   - For each integer in the list, it adds the length of the integer to `total_digits`.
   - It calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in the integer and appends the result to `zeros`.

3. **Trailing Zeros Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given string representation of an integer.
   - It iterates from the end of the string and increments a counter until it encounters a non-zero digit.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` array in descending order.
   - It calculates `subtract_zero` by summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` array (starting from the first element).
   - The idea behind this is to simulate Anna's optimal play, where she reverses the digits of the integers with the most trailing zeros first, which can potentially reduce the number of digits in the final concatenated number.
   - However, this strategy is not entirely correct. Anna's optimal play should be to reverse the digits of the integers in such a way that minimizes the number of digits in the final concatenated number. Summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` array does not necessarily achieve this goal.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1`, it means that the final number can be made to have at least `m + 1` digits, which would make Sasha win.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins.

6. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Optimal Play Strategy:
- **Anna's Strategy:**
  - Anna should reverse the digits of the integers in such a way that the resulting integers have the smallest possible number of digits. This means she should prioritize reversing integers with the most trailing zeros, but the current implementation of summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` array does not necessarily achieve this.
  - For example, consider the list `[100, 10, 1]`. The trailing zeros are `[3, 1, 0]`. If Anna reverses `100` to `1`, `10` to `1`, and `1` remains `1`, the total number of digits is reduced to 3. However, the current implementation might not always achieve this optimal reduction.

- **Sasha's Strategy:**
  - Sasha should concatenate the integers in such a way that the resulting number has the maximum possible number of digits. This means he should concatenate the largest integers first, but the current implementation does not explicitly handle this.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic for counting digits and trailing zeros is correct.
- However, the strategy for determining the winner based on the sum of every second element in the sorted `zeros` array is not optimal and may lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Example Counterexample:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  3 5
  100 10 1
  ```
  - The trailing zeros are `[3, 1, 0]`.
  - The program will sort `zeros` to `[3, 1, 0]` and sum every second element: `3 + 0 = 3`.
  - The total number of digits is `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`.
  - The program will check `abs(6 - 3) >= 5 + 1`, which is `3 >= 6`, and conclude that Anna wins.
  - However, if Anna reverses `100` to `1`, `10` to `1`, and `1` remains `1`, the total number of digits is reduced to `3`, and Sasha can concatenate `1` and `1` to get `11`, which is less than `10^5`. Therefore, Anna should win, but the program might incorrectly conclude that Sasha wins.

### Final Evaluation:
The program's strategy for determining the winner is not optimal and can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
