To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized in the loop head with the value `len(num) - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must start at a value that is greater than or equal to 0. This means `len(num) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which implies `len(num)` must be greater than 0.

2. **List `num`**: The list `num` must have at least one element for the loop to execute. If `num` is empty, `len(num)` would be 0, and `i` would start at -1, which would not enter the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(num) <= 2 * 10^5, and each integer in num is within the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
- `counter` is 0.

We need to ensure that `num` has at least one element, and `i` is initialized to `len(num) - 1`.

State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(num) <= 2 * 10^5, and each integer in num is within the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, and `len(num)` must be greater than 0**
