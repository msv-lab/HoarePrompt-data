You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Output

    Anna
    Anna

    Sasha

    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    
Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It reads the list of integers `array` and splits it into individual strings.

2. **Digit Counting and Leading Zeros:**
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to count the total number of digits in the list.
   - It also initializes an array `zeros` to store the number of trailing zeros for each integer.
   - For each integer in the list, it adds the length of the integer to `total_digits`.
   - It calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in the integer and appends the result to `zeros`.

3. **Trailing Zeros Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given string representation of an integer.
   - It iterates from the end of the string and increments a counter until it encounters a non-zero digit.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` array in descending order.
   - It calculates `subtract_zero` by summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` array (starting from the first element).
   - The idea behind this is to simulate Anna's optimal play, where she reverses the digits of the integers with the most trailing zeros first, which can potentially reduce the number of digits in the final concatenated number.
   - The program then checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - If `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1`, it means that the final number can be made to have at least `m + 1` digits, which would make Sasha win.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins.

6. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program's logic and implementation appear to be correct based on the problem description. It correctly handles the input, counts the digits and trailing zeros, and applies the optimal play strategy to determine the winner. The final condition for determining the winner is also correct.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
