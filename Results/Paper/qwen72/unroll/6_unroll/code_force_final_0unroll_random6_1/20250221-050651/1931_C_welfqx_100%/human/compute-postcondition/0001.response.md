The only objects in the loop head are the variables `r` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `r` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0**
