#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters `n`, `k`, and `s` to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us` remain unchanged; `win` is an empty set; `ans` contains the characters that were added when `win` reached the size `k`; `ps` is the number of times `win` reached the size `k`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: *`n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us` remain unchanged; `win` is an empty set; `ans` contains the characters that were added when `win` reached the size `k`; `ps` is the number of times `win` reached the size `k`. `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us` remain unchanged; `win` is an empty set; `ans` contains the characters that were added when `win` reached the size `k`; `ps` is still less than `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input, followed by a string `s`. It then processes `s` to find sequences of `k` unique characters and counts how many such sequences it can form (`ps`). If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string by appending a character from the set of the first `k` lowercase letters that is not in the current sequence, followed by `n - ps - 1` 'a' characters, and prints this string. The variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `us` remain unchanged, `win` is an empty set, and `ans` contains the characters that were added when `win` reached the size `k`.
