Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `p` from the user. It checks if there exists any index `i` in the list `p` such that `p[p[i]] == i`. If such an index is found, the function prints `2` and returns immediately. If no such index is found, the function prints `3` and returns. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it affects the program state by printing either `2` or `3` based on the input. **
