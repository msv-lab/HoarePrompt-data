You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `N` and a list `a` of `N` integers. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`. It then prints the first index `i` where the integer `i` appears exactly once in `a` or where `i` does not appear at all, and breaks out of the loop. If no such index is found, the function does not print anything for that test case. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - Alice can only append elements to `c`, while Bob can only delete elements from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty, and the final score is the MEX of `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest possible integers in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest possible integers by deleting them from `a`.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, N-1]` to find the smallest integer `i` that is either not present in `a` or has a count of 1 (since Bob can delete one occurrence of each integer).

5. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Counting Occurrences:**
     - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `a` using `cnt[a[i]] += 1`.
   - **Finding the MEX:**
     - The program iterates through the range `[0, N-1]` and checks if the current integer `i` is either not present in `a` (`cnt[i] == 0`) or has a count of 1 (`cnt[i] == 1`).
     - If `cnt[i] == 1`, it increments a counter `t` to keep track of how many such integers have been found.
     - If `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i] == 0`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Optimal Play:**
   - If `cnt[i] == 1`, Alice can include this integer in `c` and Bob can delete it, but this will not affect the MEX if `i` is the smallest integer not present in `a`.
   - If `cnt[i] == 0`, `i` is the smallest integer not present in `a`, and thus the MEX of `c` will be `i`.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` contains all integers from `0` to `N-1` by correctly identifying the MEX as `N`.

8. **Complexity:**
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(N)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. It handles all the edge cases and follows the optimal strategy for both players.

### Correctness:
**True**
