Output State: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The variable `tc` is incremented by the number of test cases executed, and the variable `t` is reset to 0 for each test case. The loop prints the first index `i` where `cnt[i] == 1` or `cnt[i] == 0` and breaks out of the loop.**
