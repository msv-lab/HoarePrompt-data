You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The variable `tc` is incremented by the number of test cases executed, and the variable `t` is reset to 0 for each test case. The loop prints the first index `i` where `cnt[i] == 1` or `cnt[i] == 0` and breaks out of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `N` and a list `a` of `N` integers. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`. It then prints the first index `i` where the integer `i` appears exactly once in `a` or where `i` does not appear at all, and breaks out of the loop. If no such index is found, the function does not print anything for that test case. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Specifically, the logic for determining the MEX of the final array `c` is flawed. The program incorrectly counts the number of unique elements in the array `a` and prints the first index where the count of an element is 0 or the count of elements with a count of 1 is greater than or equal to 2. This does not accurately reflect the optimal play for both players.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0 1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- **Optimal Play:**
  - Alice picks 1 (array `a` becomes `[0, 1, 2]`, array `c` becomes `[1]`).
  - Bob picks 0 (array `a` becomes `[1, 2]`, array `c` remains `[1]`).
  - Alice picks 1 (array `a` becomes `[2]`, array `c` becomes `[1, 1]`).
  - Bob picks 2 (array `a` becomes `[]`, array `c` becomes `[1, 1]`).

  The final array `c` is `[1, 1]`, and its MEX is 0. However, this is not the optimal play. The optimal play should result in `c` being `[1, 0]` or `[1, 2]`, both of which have a MEX of 3.

- **Program's Output:**
  - The program counts the elements and finds that `cnt[0] = 1`, `cnt[1] = 2`, and `cnt[2] = 1`.
  - It then prints `2` because `cnt[2]` is 1 and `t` (the count of elements with a count of 1) is 2.

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob, leading to an incorrect final score. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
