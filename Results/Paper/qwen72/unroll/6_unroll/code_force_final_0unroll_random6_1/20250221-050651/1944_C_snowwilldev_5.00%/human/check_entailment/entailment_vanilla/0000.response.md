### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - Alice can only append elements to `c`, while Bob can only delete elements from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty, and the final score is the MEX of `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest possible integers in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest possible integers by deleting them from `a`.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, N-1]` to find the smallest integer `i` that is either not present in `a` or has a count of 1 (since Bob can delete one occurrence of each integer).

5. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Counting Occurrences:**
     - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `a` using `cnt[a[i]] += 1`.
   - **Finding the MEX:**
     - The program iterates through the range `[0, N-1]` and checks if the current integer `i` is either not present in `a` (`cnt[i] == 0`) or has a count of 1 (`cnt[i] == 1`).
     - If `cnt[i] == 1`, it increments a counter `t` to keep track of how many such integers have been found.
     - If `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i] == 0`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Optimal Play:**
   - If `cnt[i] == 1`, Alice can include this integer in `c` and Bob can delete it, but this will not affect the MEX if `i` is the smallest integer not present in `a`.
   - If `cnt[i] == 0`, `i` is the smallest integer not present in `a`, and thus the MEX of `c` will be `i`.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` contains all integers from `0` to `N-1` by correctly identifying the MEX as `N`.

8. **Complexity:**
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(N)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. It handles all the edge cases and follows the optimal strategy for both players.

### Correctness:
**True**
