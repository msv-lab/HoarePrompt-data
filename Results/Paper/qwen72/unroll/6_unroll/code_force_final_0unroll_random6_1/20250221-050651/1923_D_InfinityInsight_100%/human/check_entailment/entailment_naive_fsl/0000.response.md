Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where a slime can eat its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. Specifically, the program fails to account for the dynamic nature of the slime sizes as they change over time due to eating their neighbors. The program only considers the initial state of the slimes and does not simulate the process of slimes eating each other over time, which is crucial for determining the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.

A specific example where the program fails:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4]`
- Expected Output: `2 1 2 1 2`
- Actual Output: `2 1 2 1 -1`

In this example, the program incorrectly reports that the 5th slime cannot be eaten, whereas it can be eaten by the 3rd slime after the 3rd slime eats the 4th slime. The correct output should be `2 1 2 1 2` instead of `2 1 2 1 -1`.
