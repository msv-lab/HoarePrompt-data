Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of the same length as `a`, where each element `ans[i]` (for `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`) is set to 1 if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)` with `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`, but only if `inx` is non-negative and greater than or equal to the last occurrence index of `a[i-1]` (stored in `last[i - 1]`). If `inx` is negative or less than `last[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` remains -1. The first element of `ans` is always -1. **
