### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have `n` slimes in a line, each with a size `a_i`.
   - Each second, a slime can eat its neighbor if it is strictly larger.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report `-1` if it is impossible.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function is used to find the index of the smallest element in the prefix sum array `left` that is greater than or equal to a given value `x`.
     - It uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point of `x` in the sorted array `a`.
     - If `x` is found in `a`, it returns the index + 1.
     - Otherwise, it returns the index where `x` would be inserted.
     - This function is used to determine the earliest point where a slime can be eaten by a larger slime.
     - **Correctness**:
       - The function correctly handles the case where `x` is less than 0 by returning `-1`.
       - The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate for finding the insertion point in a sorted list.
       - The function returns the correct index or `-1` if the index is out of bounds.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function processes the array of slime sizes `a` and returns an array `ans` where `ans[i]` is the minimum number of seconds it takes for the `i`-th slime to be eaten.
     - **Initialization**:
       - `left` is a prefix sum array that keeps track of the cumulative sum of slime sizes.
       - `last` is an array that keeps track of the last index of a slime with a different size than the current one.
       - `ans` is initialized to `-1` for all slimes, indicating that initially, we assume no slime can be eaten.
     - **Main Loop**:
       - For each slime `i`:
         - If `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, the `i`-th slime can be eaten by the `i-1`-th slime in 1 second, so `ans[i] = 1`.
         - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the cumulative sum of sizes up to the `i`-th slime minus the size of the `i`-th slime minus 1.
         - It uses `func_1` to find the earliest index `inx` where the cumulative sum is at least `x`.
         - It also checks `last[i - 1]` to ensure that the slime at `i` can be eaten by a slime that is not of the same size.
         - If `inx` is valid, it updates `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`.
     - **Correctness**:
       - The program correctly handles the case where a slime can be eaten by a larger neighbor in 1 second.
       - The use of the prefix sum array `left` and the `last` array helps in efficiently finding the earliest point where a slime can be eaten.
       - The logic for updating `ans[i]` based on the cumulative sum and the `last` array is sound and ensures that the minimum number of seconds is calculated correctly.
       - The program also correctly handles the case where a slime cannot be eaten by any other slime, returning `-1` for such slimes.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads multiple test cases and processes each one.
   - It calls `func_2` twice: once for the original array `a` and once for the reversed array `a[::-1]`.
   - It then combines the results to find the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The approach of calling `func_2` on both the original and reversed arrays ensures that the program considers both left and right neighbors.
     - The combination of results using `min` and `max` is correct for determining the minimum time to be eaten or reporting `-1` if it is impossible.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The logic and implementation are sound, and the use of prefix sums and the `last` array helps in efficiently solving the problem.

Final: **True**
