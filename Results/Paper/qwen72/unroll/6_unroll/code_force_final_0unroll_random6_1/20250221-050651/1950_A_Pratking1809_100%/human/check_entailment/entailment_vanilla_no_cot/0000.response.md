Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if three digits form a "STAIR," "PEAK," or "NONE" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `q`.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "STAIR."
   - It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a "PEAK."
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE."

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions.

The program handles all the cases mentioned in the example and adheres to the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
