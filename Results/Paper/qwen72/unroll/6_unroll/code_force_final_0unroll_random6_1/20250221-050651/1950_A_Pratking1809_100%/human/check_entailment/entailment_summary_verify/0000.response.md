Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input. This part of the program aligns with the problem description.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is met. This is correct according to the problem description.
   - **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is met. This is also correct according to the problem description.
   - **Neither Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NONE". This covers all other cases, including when `a == b == c`, `a == b`, `b == c`, or any other combination that does not form a stair or a peak.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should result in "NONE".
   - It also handles cases where the digits do not satisfy either the stair or peak conditions (e.g., `4 1 7`), which should also result in "NONE".

4. **Output**: The function prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions provided. It does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem description that only requires printing the results.

5. **Function Summary**: The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function `func`. It correctly states that the function processes the test cases, checks the conditions, and prints the appropriate output. The summary also mentions that the function does not return any value, which is true.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases as expected.

Final: **True**
