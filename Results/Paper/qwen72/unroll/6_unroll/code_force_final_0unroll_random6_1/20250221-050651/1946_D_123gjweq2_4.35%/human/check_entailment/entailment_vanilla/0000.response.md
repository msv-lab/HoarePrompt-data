### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of segments `[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_k, r_k]` such that:
     - `l_1 = 1`
     - `r_k = n`
     - `l_i <= r_i` for all `i` from 1 to `k`
     - `r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1}` for all `i` from 1 to `k - 1`
     - The bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(arr, x)`**:
   - This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`.
   - The choice of `31` as the initial bit is correct because the maximum value of `x` is less than `2^30`, so the highest bit to consider is the 30th bit (0-indexed). Starting from the 31st bit (1-indexed) ensures that all bits are considered.

3. **Function 2: `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `bit == -1`, it means we have considered all bits, and the length of `cur_arr` is the number of valid segments.
   - **Initialization**: `new_arr` is used to store the XOR results of segments that do not set the current bit.
   - **Loop**: For each element in `cur_arr`, we compute the running XOR and check if the current bit is set.
     - If the current bit is not set, we append the current XOR to `new_arr` and reset `xor` to 0.
   - **Final Check**: After the loop, if `xor` still has the current bit set, it means we cannot form a valid segment, so `thing1` is set to `-1`.
   - **Recursive Call**:
     - If the current bit of `x` is set, we need to consider both the case where the current bit is set and where it is not set.
     - We return the maximum of the two recursive calls: one with the current bit set and one with the current bit not set.
     - If the current bit of `x` is not set, we only consider the case where the current bit is not set in the segments.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The algorithm correctly handles the base case and the recursive case.
   - It ensures that the segments are formed such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - The use of `new_arr` to store the XOR results of segments that do not set the current bit is a valid approach.
   - The recursive calls and the conditions for setting `thing1` are correctly implemented to ensure the maximum number of valid segments is found.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It uses a recursive approach to consider all possible segments and ensures that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`. The logic and conditions are implemented correctly to find the maximum number of valid segments.
