Postcondition: **`new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `cur_arr` up to the point where the `bit`-th bit of the cumulative XOR is 0, `xor` is 0. If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 1, then `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`. The `bit`-th bit of `x` is 1.**
