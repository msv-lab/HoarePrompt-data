### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The given program simply sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints it for each test case.

Let's analyze why this approach works:

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) is always 1. This is because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and consecutive integers are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1).

2. **Maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \)**:
   - Given that \( \gcd(x, y) \) is 1 when \( y = x - 1 \), the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) becomes \( 1 + (x - 1) = x \).
   - For any other \( y \) where \( 1 \le y < x \), the value of \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be at most \( \frac{x}{2} \) (if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \)), and \( y \) will be less than \( x - 1 \). Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) will be less than \( x \).

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs \( x - 1 \) for each test case, which is a valid \( y \) (since \( 1 \le y < x \)).
   - This output ensures that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized for each \( x \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly finds and outputs \( y = x - 1 \) for each test case, which satisfies the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
