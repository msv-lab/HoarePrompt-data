The function reads input from the user for a specified number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then calculates the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' within `s`, and prints the result of `x + y - z`, where `x` is the count of 'map', `y` is the count of 'pie', and `z` is the count of 'mapie'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The initial state of the function parameters is not preserved as the function does not accept any parameters directly.
