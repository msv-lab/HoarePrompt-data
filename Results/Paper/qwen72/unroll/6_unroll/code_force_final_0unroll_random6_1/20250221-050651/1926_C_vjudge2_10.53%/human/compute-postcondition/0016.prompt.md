You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should actually be defined with an input parameter `n` to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(n):` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so it should be called in a loop with the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: The function `func_1` is defined with an input parameter `n` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The number of test cases `t` is an integer provided by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        
        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: The `values` list now contains the integers from 0 to 9 at the first 10 indices, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `sum_values` list now contains the cumulative sums of integers from 0 to 9 at the first 10 indices, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `total` variable is now 45. The `numbers` list and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: The `values` list now contains the calculated values for indices from 10 to `n` based on the loop logic, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `sum_values` list now contains the cumulative sums of the `values` list from index 0 to `n`, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `total` variable remains 45. The `numbers` list and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: The `values` list now contains the calculated values for indices from 10 to `n` based on the loop logic, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `sum_values` list now contains the cumulative sums of the `values` list from index 0 to `n`, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The `total` variable remains 45. The `numbers` list and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged. The loop has printed the cumulative sums for each `n` in the `numbers` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` is intended to accept an integer parameter `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. It should be called in a loop for `t` test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The function returns a value based on the input `n`, but the specific return value is not provided in the problem description.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
