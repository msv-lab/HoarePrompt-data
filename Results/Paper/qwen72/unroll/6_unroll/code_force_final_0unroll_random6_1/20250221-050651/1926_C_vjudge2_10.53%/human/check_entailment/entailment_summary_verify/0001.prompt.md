You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

def func_1():

    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())

    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases, and then reads `t` integers `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) from the user. It calculates and stores the cumulative sums of a specific sequence of values for each integer `n` in a list `sum_values`. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum for each `n` in the `numbers` list. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then reads `t` integers `n` and stores them in a list `numbers`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, are initialized to store the sum of digits for each number and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively.
   - The `values` list is initialized with zeros up to the maximum value in `numbers + 1`.
   - The `sum_values` list is also initialized with zeros up to the maximum value in `numbers + 1`.

3. **Precomputation for Single-Digit Numbers:**
   - The program precomputes the sum of digits for numbers from 1 to 9 and stores them in the `values` list.
   - It also computes the cumulative sum of these values and stores them in the `sum_values` list.

4. **Precomputation for Multi-Digit Numbers:**
   - For numbers from 10 to the maximum value in `numbers`, the program computes the sum of digits.
   - It converts the number to a string to extract the last digit and the remainder of the number when the last digit is removed.
   - The sum of digits for the current number is computed as the sum of the last digit and the sum of digits of the remainder.
   - The cumulative sum for the current number is computed by adding the sum of digits of the current number to the cumulative sum of the previous number.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the cumulative sum of the sum of digits for the given `n`.

### Analysis:
- **Efficiency:**
  - The program uses precomputation to avoid recomputing the sum of digits for each test case, which is efficient.
  - The precomputation step runs in O(max(numbers)) time, which is feasible given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5).
  - The output step runs in O(t) time, which is also efficient given the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

- **Correctness:**
  - The logic for computing the sum of digits and the cumulative sum is correct.
  - The program correctly handles the conversion of numbers to strings to extract digits.
  - The cumulative sum is correctly computed and stored in the `sum_values` list.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles single-digit numbers correctly.
  - The program handles multi-digit numbers correctly by breaking them down into their constituent digits.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently handles the given problem constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
