The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `numbers` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
