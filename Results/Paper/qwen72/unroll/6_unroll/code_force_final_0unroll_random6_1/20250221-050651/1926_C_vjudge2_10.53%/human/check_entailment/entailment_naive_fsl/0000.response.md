Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it processes multi-digit numbers. Specifically, the line `remainder = int(word[:-1])` does not correctly handle the sum of the digits for numbers with more than one digit. For example, for the number 21, `word[:-1]` will be "2", and `remainder` will be 2, but the sum of the digits should be 2 + 1, not just 2. This will lead to incorrect results for numbers greater than or equal to 10.

To illustrate, consider the input `n = 12`:
- The program will correctly calculate the sum for numbers 1 to 9.
- For `n = 10`, `word` is "10", `last` is 0, and `remainder` is 1. The program will set `values[10] = values[0] + values[1] = 0 + 1 = 1`, which is incorrect. The correct sum of digits for 10 is 1 + 0 = 1, but the program should have calculated it as 1.

This error will propagate to all subsequent numbers, leading to incorrect sums for `n = 11` and `n = 12` as well.

To fix this, the program should correctly sum the digits of the number, not just the last digit and the remainder of the number when the last digit is removed.
