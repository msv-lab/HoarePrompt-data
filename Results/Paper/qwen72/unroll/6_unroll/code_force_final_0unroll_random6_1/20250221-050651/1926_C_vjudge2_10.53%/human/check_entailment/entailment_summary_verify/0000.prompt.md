You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)

    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases, and then reads `t` integers `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) from the user. It calculates and stores the cumulative sums of a specific sequence of values for each integer `n` in a list `sum_values`. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum for each `n` in the `numbers` list. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it processes multi-digit numbers. Specifically, the line `remainder = int(word[:-1])` does not correctly handle the sum of the digits for numbers with more than one digit. For example, for the number 21, `word[:-1]` will be "2", and `remainder` will be 2, but the sum of the digits should be 2 + 1, not just 2. This will lead to incorrect results for numbers greater than or equal to 10.

To illustrate, consider the input `n = 12`:
- The program will correctly calculate the sum for numbers 1 to 9.
- For `n = 10`, `word` is "10", `last` is 0, and `remainder` is 1. The program will set `values[10] = values[0] + values[1] = 0 + 1 = 1`, which is incorrect. The correct sum of digits for 10 is 1 + 0 = 1, but the program should have calculated it as 1.

This error will propagate to all subsequent numbers, leading to incorrect sums for `n = 11` and `n = 12` as well.

To fix this, the program should correctly sum the digits of the number, not just the last digit and the remainder of the number when the last digit is removed.
