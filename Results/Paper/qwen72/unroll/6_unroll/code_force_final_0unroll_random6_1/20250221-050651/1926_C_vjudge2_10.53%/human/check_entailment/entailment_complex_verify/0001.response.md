### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then reads `t` integers `n` and stores them in a list `numbers`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, are initialized to store the sum of digits for each number and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively.
   - The `values` list is initialized with zeros up to the maximum value in `numbers + 1`.
   - The `sum_values` list is also initialized with zeros up to the maximum value in `numbers + 1`.

3. **Precomputation for Single-Digit Numbers:**
   - The program correctly precomputes the sum of digits for numbers from 1 to 9 and stores them in the `values` list.
   - It also correctly computes the cumulative sum of these values and stores them in the `sum_values` list.

4. **Precomputation for Multi-Digit Numbers:**
   - The program correctly computes the sum of digits for numbers from 10 to the maximum value in `numbers`.
   - It converts the number to a string to extract the last digit and the remainder of the number when the last digit is removed.
   - The sum of digits for the current number is computed as the sum of the last digit and the sum of digits of the remainder.
   - The cumulative sum for the current number is computed by adding the sum of digits of the current number to the cumulative sum of the previous number.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program correctly prints the cumulative sum of the sum of digits for the given `n`.

### Analysis:
- **Efficiency:**
  - The program uses precomputation to avoid recomputing the sum of digits for each test case, which is efficient.
  - The precomputation step runs in O(max(numbers)) time, which is feasible given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5).
  - The output step runs in O(t) time, which is also efficient given the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

- **Correctness:**
  - The logic for computing the sum of digits and the cumulative sum is correct.
  - The program correctly handles the conversion of numbers to strings to extract digits.
  - The cumulative sum is correctly computed and stored in the `sum_values` list.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles single-digit numbers correctly.
  - The program handles multi-digit numbers correctly by breaking them down into their constituent digits.

### Issues:
- **Variable `n` in the second loop:**
  - The variable `n` in the second loop should be `max(numbers)` instead of `n` to ensure that the precomputation is done up to the maximum number in the list `numbers`. The current implementation uses `n` from the last test case, which can lead to incorrect results if the last test case is not the maximum number.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[-1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was mostly accurate, but it missed a critical issue with the variable `n` in the second loop.
- The corrected code ensures that the precomputation is done up to the maximum number in the list `numbers`, which is necessary for the correct output for all test cases.

Final: **False** (due to the variable `n` issue in the second loop)
