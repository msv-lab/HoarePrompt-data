Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array is of length 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if the array length is 1, the output should be -1 because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. However, the program does not check for this specific case and proceeds with the logic that assumes the array length is greater than 1.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
1
1
```
The program will output:
```
1
```
But the correct output should be:
```
-1
```

This is a clear violation of the problem description, making the program incorrect.
