The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The precondition provides information about the state of the program, including the values of `flag`, `ans`, `cnt`, `i`, `n`, and `arr`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the value `-1` specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **-1**
