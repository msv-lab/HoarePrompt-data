You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is a beautiful array with elements in the range 1 to n, and the integer `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `flag` will be **False** if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in the list `arr` that are not equal. Otherwise, if all consecutive elements in the list `arr` are equal, `flag` will remain **True**. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` will remain unchanged.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: The value of `flag` remains unchanged from the initial state. The value of `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements that are equal to `val` (which is `arr[0]`) found in the list `arr`. The value of `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `val` at the end of the list `arr`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum of the initial value of ans and the count of consecutive elements equal to val at the end of the list arr)
    #State: *The value of `flag` remains unchanged from the initial state. The value of `ans` is the minimum of the initial `ans` and `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `val` at the end of the list `arr`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. It returns an error message if any of the input constraints are violated. Otherwise, it returns a list of results, each corresponding to the processing of the list `a` for the respective test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
