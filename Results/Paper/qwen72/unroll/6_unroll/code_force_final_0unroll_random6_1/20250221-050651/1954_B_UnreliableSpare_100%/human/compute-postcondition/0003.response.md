To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1, as specified by `range(1, n)`.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not run because `range(1, n)` will be an empty range.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from input.
- `flag` is True.

We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` should start at 1, which is already specified by the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `flag` is True**
