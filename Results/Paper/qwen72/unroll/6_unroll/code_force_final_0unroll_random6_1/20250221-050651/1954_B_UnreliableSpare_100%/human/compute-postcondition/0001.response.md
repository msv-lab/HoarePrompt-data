Output State: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is a beautiful array with elements in the range 1 to `n`, and the integer `n` satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. `n` is now an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers read from input.**
