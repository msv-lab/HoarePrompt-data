You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is intended to be called multiple times with different sets of three digits a, b, and c, where each digit is an integer in the range 0 to 9, inclusive. The number of test cases, t, is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `n` times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it will print 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated with each iteration, but the value of `n` will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `n` times, where it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if the three digits form a stair by using the condition `a < b < c`.
     - If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - If the first condition is false, it checks if the three digits form a peak by using the condition `a < b and b > c`.
     - If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the required output for each test case based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 2 3`
  - Condition: `1 < 2 < 3` (True)
  - Output: "STAIR" (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3 2 1`
  - Condition: `3 < 2 < 1` (False)
  - Condition: `3 < 2 and 2 > 1` (False)
  - Output: "NONE" (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1 5 3`
  - Condition: `1 < 5 < 3` (False)
  - Condition: `1 < 5 and 5 > 3` (True)
  - Output: "PEAK" (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `3 4 1`
  - Condition: `3 < 4 < 1` (False)
  - Condition: `3 < 4 and 4 > 1` (True)
  - Output: "PEAK" (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `0 0 0`
  - Condition: `0 < 0 < 0` (False)
  - Condition: `0 < 0 and 0 > 0` (False)
  - Output: "NONE" (Correct)

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `4 1 7`
  - Condition: `4 < 1 < 7` (False)
  - Condition: `4 < 1 and 1 > 7` (False)
  - Output: "NONE" (Correct)

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `4 5 7`
  - Condition: `4 < 5 < 7` (True)
  - Output: "STAIR" (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
