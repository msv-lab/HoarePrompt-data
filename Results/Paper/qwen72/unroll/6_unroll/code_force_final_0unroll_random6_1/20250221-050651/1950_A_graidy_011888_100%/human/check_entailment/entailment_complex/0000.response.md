Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n` from the input. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `n` times, which is appropriate since there are `n` test cases to process.

3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This correctly parses the input into three separate integer values, as required by the problem description.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is true. This correctly identifies a stair.
   - The program checks if `a < b` and `b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is true. This correctly identifies a peak.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'NONE'. This correctly identifies cases that are neither a stair nor a peak.

5. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, as specified in the problem description.

6. **Overall Functionality**: The function `func` processes all `n` test cases and prints the appropriate output for each one. It does not return any value and does not modify any external state, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets all the specified requirements.

Correctness: **True**
