The function `read` is intended to read input data for the game described, where the input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case includes the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, the starting player `x`, and a list of throws with distances `r_i` and directions `c_i` ('0' for clockwise, '1' for counterclockwise, '?' for unknown direction). The input is structured as follows: the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ x ≤ n). This is followed by `m` lines, each containing an integer `r_i` (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a character `c_i` ('0', '1', or '?'). The sum of `n * m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
