Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer.
   - `func_3` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part to an integer, returning a list of integers.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4`**:
   - `func_4` reads the values `n`, `m`, and `x` from `func_3`, where `n` is the number of players, `m` is the number of throws, and `x` is the initial player with the ball.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` from `func_1`.
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions if `c` is `?`.
   - After all throws, it checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and, if so, removes `0` and adds `n` to the set (since `0` corresponds to player `n` in the circle).
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique players who could have the ball and the sorted list of these players.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic correctly handles the initial position and the subsequent throws.
   - It correctly considers both possible directions for throws marked with `?`.
   - The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are unique.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly.
   - The final adjustment for `0` to `n` is necessary because the modulo operation can result in `0`, which should be interpreted as `n`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `c` is `?` by considering both directions.
   - It correctly handles the case where the ball could be with player `n` by adjusting the set.
   - The function ensures that the output is sorted and contains unique elements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
