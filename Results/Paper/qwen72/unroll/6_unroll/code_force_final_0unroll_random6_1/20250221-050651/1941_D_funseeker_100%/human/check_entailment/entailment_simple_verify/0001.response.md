### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read lines from the standard input, which is efficient and appropriate for the problem.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read and parse the input. `func_1` reads a line and strips the newline character, `func_2` converts the line to an integer, and `func_3` splits the line into a list of integers. These functions are correctly implemented and used.

2. **Main Function (`func_4`):**
   - The function `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x` to keep track of the possible positions of the ball. This is correct because initially, the ball is only with player `x`.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the new possible positions of the ball.
   - If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to be the set of all possible positions stored in `temp`.

4. **Handling Edge Case for Player 0:**
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and `0` would be an invalid player number. This handling is correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players. This is correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic for handling both clockwise and counterclockwise throws is correct. The use of the modulo operator ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly.
  - The handling of the unknown direction (`?`) is also correct, as it considers both possible directions for each throw.
  - The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are unique, which is necessary to avoid counting the same player multiple times.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown (`?`).
  - It also correctly handles the case where the direction is known (`0` or `1`).
  - The edge case where the ball might end up with player `0` (which should be converted to player `n`) is correctly handled.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of sets and the `%` operator ensures that the program efficiently handles the transitions and avoids duplicate positions.
  - The program's complexity is appropriate for the given constraints, as it processes each throw in constant time and the number of throws is limited to 1000.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
