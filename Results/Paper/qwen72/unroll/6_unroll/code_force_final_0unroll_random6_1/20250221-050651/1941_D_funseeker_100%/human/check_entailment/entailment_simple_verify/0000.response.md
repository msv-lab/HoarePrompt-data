### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which correctly splits and converts the input line into integers.
   - It then reads `m` lines of throws, each containing a distance `r` and a direction `c` using `func_1()`.

2. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` to include all possible new positions of the ball.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is then updated to `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the ball might end up with player 0. If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set.
   - This ensures that the final set of possible positions does not include `0` and instead includes `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball at the end of the game.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

5. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The logic for updating the set `ans` is correct. It considers all possible directions for each throw and updates the set accordingly.
   - The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are unique, which is a requirement of the problem.
   - The final adjustment to handle the edge case where `0` is replaced by `n` is also correctly implemented.

6. **Edge Case Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the ball might end up with player 0 and adjusts it to player `n`.
   - This is crucial because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and player 0 is not a valid player.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, handles all possible inputs, and produces the correct output. There are no logical errors or edge cases that the program fails to handle.

Final: **True**
