### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to simulate the game described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key components and their correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`.
   - It then reads the details of each throw (distance `r` and direction `c`) using `func_1()`.

2. **Set Initialization:**
   - The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible new positions of the ball.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - This ensures that all possible positions are considered for each throw, including the cases where the direction is unknown.

4. **Handling Edge Case for Player 0:**
   - After processing all throws, if `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. This is necessary because player 0 is not a valid player and should be adjusted to player `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of unique elements in `ans`.
   - It then prints the sorted elements of `ans`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of Set Operations:**
  - The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are unique, which is crucial for the problem.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly.

- **Direction Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the three possible directions ('0', '1', '?') by updating the set `temp` accordingly.
  - For unknown directions ('?'), both possible positions (clockwise and counterclockwise) are considered.

- **Edge Case for Player 0:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where the ball might end up with player 0 by adjusting it to player `n`.

- **Test Case Handling:**
  - The program processes each test case independently, which is consistent with the problem statement.

### Potential Issues:

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The modulo operation can sometimes result in negative values when subtracting `r` from `q`. In Python, `(q - r) % n` will always yield a non-negative result, but it's worth noting that this is correct for the problem's constraints.

- **Set Operations:**
  - The program uses sets to keep track of possible positions, which is efficient and ensures uniqueness. However, the set operations are performed correctly and do not introduce any errors.

- **Input/Output:**
  - The input and output handling is consistent with the problem statement. The program reads the input as specified and outputs the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases and input constraints as required.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
