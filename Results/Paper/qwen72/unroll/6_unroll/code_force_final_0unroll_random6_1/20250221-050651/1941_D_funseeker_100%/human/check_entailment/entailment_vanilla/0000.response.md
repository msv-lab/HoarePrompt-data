### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read lines from the standard input, which is a common and efficient way to handle input in Python for competitive programming.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read and parse the input. `func_1` reads a line and strips the newline character, `func_2` converts the line to an integer, and `func_3` splits the line into a list of integers.

2. **Main Function (`func_4`):**
   - The function `func_4` is the main logic of the program. It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x` to keep track of the possible positions of the ball.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the new possible positions of the ball.
   - If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to be the set of all possible positions stored in `temp`.

4. **Handling Edge Case for Player 0:**
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and `0` would be an invalid player number.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic correctly handles the transitions for both clockwise and counterclockwise throws.
  - The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are unique.
  - The handling of the edge case where `0` is converted to `n` is correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown (`?`).
  - It also correctly handles the case where the direction is known (`0` or `1`).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of sets and the `%` operator ensures that the program efficiently handles the transitions and avoids duplicate positions.
  - The `lru_cache` is not used in this program, but it is not necessary for the given problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
