The function `func_4` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It operates on three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` that are obtained from a call to `func_3`, where `2 <= n <= 1000`, `1 <= m <= 1000`, and `1 <= x <= n`. The function computes a set `ans` of integers that can be reached by adding or subtracting multiples of `r` (obtained from `func_1`) to the initial value `x`, modulo `n`, over `m` iterations. If `0` is in the set `ans` after these iterations, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. The function then prints the number of unique elements in `ans` and the sorted elements of `ans`.
