The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_3()`. Since the specific values returned by `func_3()` are not provided, we can only state that the new values of `n`, `m`, and `x` will be integers within the ranges specified in the initial state: 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.**
