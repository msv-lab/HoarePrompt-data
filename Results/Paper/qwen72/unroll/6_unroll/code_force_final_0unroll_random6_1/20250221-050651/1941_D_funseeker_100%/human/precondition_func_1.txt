n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, and throws is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a string c_i ('0', '1', or '?') representing the distance and direction of the throw, respectively.
