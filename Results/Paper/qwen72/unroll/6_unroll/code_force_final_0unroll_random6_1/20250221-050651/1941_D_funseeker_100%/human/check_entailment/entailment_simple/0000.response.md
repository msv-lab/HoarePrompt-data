### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`, which in turn calls `func_1()` to read a line of input and converts it to an integer.
   - For each test case, the program reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which splits the input line and converts each part to an integer.
   - The program then reads `m` lines of input, each containing the distance `r` and the direction `c` of a throw.

2. **Set Initialization:**
   - The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.

3. **Throw Processing:**
   - For each throw, the program calculates the possible positions the ball could be in based on the direction `c` and the distance `r`.
   - If `c` is '0' or '?', the ball could be moved clockwise, so `(q + r) % n` is added to the set `temp`.
   - If `c` is '1' or '?', the ball could be moved counterclockwise, so `(q - r) % n` is added to the set `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. This is because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and `0` should be treated as `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of unique players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Input Handling:**
  - The input handling is correct. The program reads the number of test cases and the values for each test case as described in the problem statement.
- **Correctness of Set Operations:**
  - The set operations are correct. The program correctly calculates the possible positions of the ball based on the given distances and directions.
  - The use of modulo `n` ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly.
- **Correctness of Final Adjustments:**
  - The final adjustments are correct. If `0` is in the set, it is replaced by `n`, which is the correct way to handle the circular nature of the game.
- **Correctness of Output:**
  - The output is correct. The program prints the number of unique players who could have the ball and then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input, processes the throws, and produces the correct output for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
