Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input.** 

The tree is represented by n-1 edges, and it is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The values of `x` and `y` are now integers that have been read from the user input. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
