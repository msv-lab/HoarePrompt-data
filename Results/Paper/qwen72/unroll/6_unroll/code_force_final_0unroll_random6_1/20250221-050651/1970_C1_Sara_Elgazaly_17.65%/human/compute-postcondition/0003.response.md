Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `lst` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, where each key in `lst` has had `x - 1` pairs of integers appended to its list, with each pair `(a, b)` being appended to both `lst[a]` and `lst[b]`.**
