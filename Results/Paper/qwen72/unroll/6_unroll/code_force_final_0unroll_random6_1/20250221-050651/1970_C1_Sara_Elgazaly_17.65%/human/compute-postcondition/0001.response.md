Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `lst` is a defaultdict with lists as default values.**

The code initializes `lst` as a defaultdict with lists as the default factory. This means that `lst` will automatically create an empty list for any new key that is accessed. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `u1`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
