Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
   - He cuts it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \) of the rectangle.
   - It calls the function `func_1(a, b)` to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if \( b \) is even and returns 'yes' if it is, otherwise 'no'.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - If \( b \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \).
   - These two smaller rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle of size \( 2a \times \frac{b}{2} \).
   - This new rectangle \( 2a \times \frac{b}{2} \) is different from the original \( a \times b \) if \( 2a \neq b \) and \( a \neq \frac{b}{2} \).

4. **Identifying the Flaw**:
   - The program only checks if \( b \) is even and does not consider the condition \( 2a \neq b \) and \( a \neq \frac{b}{2} \).
   - For example, if \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 4 \), the program will return 'yes' because \( b \) is even, but the new rectangle \( 4 \times 2 \) is the same as the original \( 2 \times 4 \) after a 90-degree rotation.
   - Similarly, if \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \), the program will return 'yes' because \( b \) is even, but the new rectangle \( 2 \times 1 \) is the same as the original \( 1 \times 2 \) after a 90-degree rotation.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect because it does not fully implement the logic required to determine if a different rectangle can be formed.
   - It should also check if the new rectangle formed is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

Final: **False**
