Output State: **The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the number of free cells (`0`s) between the first and last chip (`1`s) in the ribbon. The variables `n`, `a`, and `res` are reset and redefined for each test case, so their final values are not meaningful outside the context of the last test case processed.**
