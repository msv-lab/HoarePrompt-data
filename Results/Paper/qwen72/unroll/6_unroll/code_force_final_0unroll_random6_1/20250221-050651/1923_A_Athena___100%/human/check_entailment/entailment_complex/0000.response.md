Reasoning:
The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases where each test case involves a ribbon of cells, some of which contain chips (1s) and others are free (0s). The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to move the chips so that they form a single contiguous block without any free cells between them.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the state of the ribbon.

2. **Trimming the Ribbon**:
   - The function removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`. This is done to focus on the segment of the ribbon that contains chips.
   - The `while a and a[0] == 0:` loop removes leading zeros.
   - The `while a and a[-1] == 0:` loop removes trailing zeros.

3. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - After trimming, the function iterates through the remaining list `a` and counts the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s).
   - The variable `res` is used to store this count.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the count `res` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Trimming**:
  - Removing leading and trailing zeros is correct because these cells do not affect the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips. The operations can only be performed on chips that have free cells to their left, and leading/trailing zeros do not influence the internal block of chips.

- **Counting Free Cells**:
  - The function counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip. This count is indeed the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. Each free cell represents a potential move of a chip to the left to fill the gap.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the ribbon already contains a single block of chips (e.g., `1 1 1 1`), the function correctly prints `0` because no operations are needed.
  - If the ribbon has chips at the edges with free cells in between (e.g., `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`), the function correctly counts the free cells and prints the result.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips on the ribbon. The trimming and counting steps are appropriate and handle the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
