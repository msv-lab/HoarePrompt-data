You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 or 1, representing whether a cell is free or contains a chip, respectively. At least one cell in each test case contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the number of free cells (`0`s) between the first and last chip (`1`s) in the ribbon. The variables `n`, `a`, and `res` are reset and redefined for each test case, so their final values are not meaningful outside the context of the last test case processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cell states `a`.

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program removes leading zeros from the list `a` using a while loop. This is done to ignore free cells that are to the left of all chips.
   - Similarly, it removes trailing zeros from the list `a` using another while loop. This is done to ignore free cells that are to the right of all chips.
   - These steps are necessary because the goal is to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them, and leading or trailing zeros do not affect the operations needed to achieve this.

3. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros, the program iterates through the remaining list `a` and counts the number of free cells (i.e., cells with `0`).
   - The number of free cells counted is the number of operations required to move all chips to form a single block without any free cells between them. This is because each free cell in the middle of the list represents a gap that needs to be filled by moving a chip.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of operations required.

### Analysis of the Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 1
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `6`, `0 1 0 0 0 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 0
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `6`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 0
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `5`, `1 0 1 0 1`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 2
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `9`, `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 3
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem by removing leading and trailing zeros and then counting the free cells in the middle. This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips is calculated accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
