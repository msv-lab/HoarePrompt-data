The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of integers, and `i` is not yet defined. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least one element, `i` is 0**
