### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
   - It then calls `func_2(a)` to find the maximum segment sum.
   - The result is used to compute the final answer, which is then printed after applying `func_1`.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(number)`:**
     - This function returns the remainder of `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
     - It is correctly implemented and used.

   - **`func_2(arr)`:**
     - This function is intended to find the maximum segment sum in the array `arr`.
     - However, the implementation has several issues:
       - It initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` incorrectly. `new_segment` should be a list with two elements: the sum of the current segment and the starting index.
       - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `segments_variants` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers.
       - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are empty or invalid.
       - The final return value is a list, which is not what the main program expects. The main program expects a single integer representing the maximum segment sum.

4. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program uses the result of `func_2(a)` to compute the final answer.
   - The formula `answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is incorrect because `max_segment[0]` should be the maximum segment sum, not a list.
   - The program also does not handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers correctly.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The program is incorrect because `func_2` does not return the correct maximum segment sum.
   - The main program logic is also incorrect due to the misuse of the result from `func_2`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
