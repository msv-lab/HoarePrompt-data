Output State: **The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the square has a positive area with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The number of test cases, t, is an input integer between 1 and 100.**
