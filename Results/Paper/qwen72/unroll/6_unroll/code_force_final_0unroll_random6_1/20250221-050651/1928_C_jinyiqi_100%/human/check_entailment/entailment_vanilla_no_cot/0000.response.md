Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, representing Vasya's position in the line and the number he received during the settling.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function is used to find all divisors of a given number `x`. It does this by iterating from 1 to the square root of `x` and checking if `x` is divisible by the current number `i`. If it is, both `i` and `x // i` are added to the list of divisors. The function then reverses the list of smaller divisors and concatenates it with the list of larger divisors to ensure all divisors are included.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks if `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`. If true, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` to get the divisors of `n + x - 2`.
   - For each divisor `s` in the list, it checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`. If both conditions are met, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to the `output` list.
   - Similarly, it checks if `(n - x) % 2 == 0`. If true, it calls `func_1(n - x)` to get the divisors of `n - x`.
   - For each divisor `s` in the list, it checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`. If both conditions are met, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to the `output` list.
   - The `output` list is converted to a set to remove duplicates, and the length of the set is printed, which represents the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the number of different `k` values for each test case.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the logic for determining the valid `k` values based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
