### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves finding all possible values of `k` such that, given Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x`, the settling pattern described in the problem holds.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the numbers assigned to positions follow a specific sequence.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a given `k`, the sequence of numbers assigned to positions is: `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, k-2, ..., 2, 1, 2, ..., k, ...`.
   - The sequence repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` must fit into this pattern.

3. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - If Vasya's position `n` is within the first `k` positions, then `x` should be `n`.
   - If Vasya's position `n` is within the next `k-2` positions, then `x` should be `k - (n - k)`.
   - The pattern repeats, so we need to consider the modulo operation with `2k - 2`.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates two potential values for `k` based on the conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to find all divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
   - For each divisor, it checks if it can form a valid `k` and appends it to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique valid `k` values.

5. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in a list.
   - It correctly handles the divisors by iterating up to the square root of `x` and appending both the divisor and its corresponding pair.
   - The divisors are returned in a combined list with the larger divisors first and the smaller divisors in reverse order.

6. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are derived from the pattern of the settling.
   - The program correctly identifies potential `k` values by checking if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - The use of `set` to remove duplicates ensures that only unique `k` values are counted.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find all possible values of `k` that fit the given constraints. The conditions and the divisor finding function are appropriate for the problem.

**Correctness: **True****
