Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and it has been assigned the value read from the input. `R` is a function that reads a space-separated list of integers from input. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, and each query is a pair of integers (l, r) where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
