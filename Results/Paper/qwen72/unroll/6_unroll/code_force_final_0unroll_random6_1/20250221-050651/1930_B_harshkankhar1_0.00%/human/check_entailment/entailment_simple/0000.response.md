### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function `func_1()` creates a list `a` that represents a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a`.

3. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The list `a` is initially `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - The slicing operation `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices. This means the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, etc., are reversed.

4. **Validation of the Permutation:**
   - The goal is to ensure that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the elements at even indices are not in their original positions, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - For `n = 4`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - After reversing the elements at even indices, the list becomes `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
   - This permutation is valid because:
     - `p_1 = 4` does not divide `p_3 = 3`.
     - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4 = 1`.
   - For `n = 3`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - After reversing the elements at even indices, the list remains `[1, 2, 3]` because there is only one even index (0).
   - This permutation is valid because there are no two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

6. **General Case:**
   - For any `n`, the list `a` will be `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - Reversing the elements at even indices will result in a list where the elements at even indices are not in their original positions.
   - This ensures that the divisibility condition is not met for any pair of indices `i` and `j`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation that meets the problem's requirements. The slicing and reversing operation ensures that the elements at even indices are not in their original positions, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.

Correctness: **True**
