You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, performs a series of calculations to determine a value `t`, and prints `t`. The function does not modify any external variables or parameters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - The function calculates the total number of cells required for all 2x2 icons as `b * 4`.
   - It then determines the number of screens needed for these 2x2 icons by dividing the total number of cells by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells) and rounding up. This is done using the formula:
     - `t = b * 2` (since each 2x2 icon requires 2 rows of 5 cells each).
     - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t = t // 5` (exact division).
     - Otherwise, `t = t // 5 + 1` (rounding up).

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - The function calculates the total number of cells available on the screens already used for 2x2 icons as `t * 15`.
   - It then subtracts the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons (`b * 4`) to get the number of remaining cells: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.

4. **Checking if Remaining Cells are Enough for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells `t1` are greater than or equal to the number of 1x1 icons `a`, then no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `t2 = a - t1` (remaining 1x1 icons that need space).
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t = t + t2 // 15` (exact division).
     - Otherwise, `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` (rounding up).

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Step 1 and 2:**
  - The calculation for the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is correct. Each 2x2 icon requires 2 rows, and since each screen has 5 rows, the number of screens needed is `b * 2 // 5` if the division is exact, or `b * 2 // 5 + 1` if there is a remainder.
- **Step 3:**
  - The calculation for the remaining cells is correct. Each screen has 15 cells, and the total number of cells used by 2x2 icons is `b * 4`.
- **Step 4:**
  - The logic for checking if the remaining cells are enough for 1x1 icons is correct. If not, the additional screens required are calculated by dividing the remaining 1x1 icons by 15 and rounding up.
- **Step 5:**
  - The output is correct, printing the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
