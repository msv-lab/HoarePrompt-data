### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculations**:
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2`, which represents the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - The number of screens required for the 2x2 icons is calculated by dividing `t` by 5 and adding 1 if there is a remainder. This is because each screen has 5 rows, and each 2x2 icon occupies 2 rows, so `b * 2` gives the total number of rows needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the total number of cells available on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. This is because each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), and `b * 4` is the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there are enough cells left to place all the 1x1 icons on the same screens, so `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, it means additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The number of additional screens required is calculated by dividing the remaining number of 1x1 icons (`t2 = a - t1`) by 15 and adding 1 if there is a remainder.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons is correct. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the total number of rows needed is `b * 2`. Dividing this by 5 and adding 1 if there is a remainder correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
- The logic for calculating the remaining cells available after placing the 2x2 icons is also correct. Each screen has 15 cells, and `b * 4` cells are occupied by the 2x2 icons, so `t * 15 - b * 4` gives the number of cells left.
- The logic for determining if additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons is correct. If the remaining cells are not enough, the function calculates the additional screens needed by dividing the remaining 1x1 icons by 15 and adding 1 if there is a remainder.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The calculations and conditions are accurate and handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
