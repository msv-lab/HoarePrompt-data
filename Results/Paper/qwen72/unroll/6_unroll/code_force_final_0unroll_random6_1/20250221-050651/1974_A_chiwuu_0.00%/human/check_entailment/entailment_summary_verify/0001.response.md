### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - The function calculates the total number of cells required for all 2x2 icons as `b * 4`.
   - It then determines the number of screens needed for these 2x2 icons by dividing the total number of cells by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells) and rounding up. This is done using the formula:
     - `t = b * 2` (since each 2x2 icon requires 2 rows of 5 cells each).
     - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t = t // 5` (exact division).
     - Otherwise, `t = t // 5 + 1` (rounding up).
   - This step is correct. Each 2x2 icon requires 2 rows, and since each screen has 5 rows, the number of screens needed is `b * 2 // 5` if the division is exact, or `b * 2 // 5 + 1` if there is a remainder.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - The function calculates the total number of cells available on the screens already used for 2x2 icons as `t * 15`.
   - It then subtracts the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons (`b * 4`) to get the number of remaining cells: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - This step is also correct. Each screen has 15 cells, and the total number of cells used by 2x2 icons is `b * 4`.

4. **Checking if Remaining Cells are Enough for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells `t1` are greater than or equal to the number of 1x1 icons `a`, then no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `t2 = a - t1` (remaining 1x1 icons that need space).
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t = t + t2 // 15` (exact division).
     - Otherwise, `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` (rounding up).
   - This step is correct. If the remaining cells are not enough, the additional screens required are calculated by dividing the remaining 1x1 icons by 15 and rounding up.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case.
   - This step is correct, and the output is as expected.

### Verification with Test Cases:
Let's verify the function with the provided test cases:

- **Test Case 1: (1, 1)**
  - `t = 1 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 1` (1 screen for 2x2 icons).
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11` (11 remaining cells).
  - `t1 >= 1` (11 >= 1), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1` (Correct).

- **Test Case 2: (7, 2)**
  - `t = 2 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 1` (1 screen for 2x2 icons).
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7` (7 remaining cells).
  - `t1 >= 7` (7 >= 7), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1` (Correct).

- **Test Case 3: (12, 4)**
  - `t = 4 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 2` (2 screens for 2x2 icons).
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 14` (14 remaining cells).
  - `t1 < 12` (14 < 12), so additional screens are needed.
  - `t2 = 12 - 14 = -2` (This should be `12 - 14 = -2`, but it should be `12 - 14 = 2`).
  - `t = 2 + 2 // 15 + 1 = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3` (This should be `2 + 2 // 15 + 1 = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3`, but it should be `2 + 1 = 3`).
  - Output: `2` (Incorrect, should be `3`).

- **Test Case 4: (0, 3)**
  - `t = 3 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 2` (2 screens for 2x2 icons).
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18` (18 remaining cells).
  - `t1 >= 0` (18 >= 0), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `2` (Correct).

- **Test Case 5: (1, 0)**
  - `t = 0 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 1` (1 screen for 2x2 icons).
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 15` (15 remaining cells).
  - `t1 >= 1` (15 >= 1), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1` (Correct).

- **Test Case 6: (8, 1)**
  - `t = 1 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 1` (1 screen for 2x2 icons).
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11` (11 remaining cells).
  - `t1 < 8` (11 < 8), so additional screens are needed.
  - `t2 = 8 - 11 = -3` (This should be `8 - 11 = -3`, but it should be `8 - 11 = 3`).
  - `t = 1 + 3 // 15 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2` (This should be `1 + 3 // 15 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`, but it should be `1 + 1 = 2`).
  - Output: `1` (Incorrect, should be `2`).

- **Test Case 7: (0, 0)**
  - `t = 0 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 0` (0 screens for 2x2 icons).
  - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0` (0 remaining cells).
  - `t1 >= 0` (0 >= 0), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `0` (Correct).

- **Test Case 8: (2, 0)**
  - `t = 0 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 1` (1 screen for 2x2 icons).
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 15` (15 remaining cells).
  - `t1 >= 2` (15 >= 2), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1` (Correct).

- **Test Case 9: (15, 0)**
  - `t = 0 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 1` (1 screen for 2x2 icons).
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 15` (15 remaining cells).
  - `t1 < 15` (15 < 15), so additional screens are needed.
  - `t2 = 15 - 15 = 0` (0 remaining 1x1 icons).
  - `t = 1 + 0 // 15 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2` (This should be `1 + 0 // 15 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`, but it should be `1 + 1 = 2`).
  - Output: `1` (Incorrect, should be `1`).

- **Test Case 10: (8, 2)**
  - `t = 2 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 1` (1 screen for 2x2 icons).
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7` (7 remaining cells).
  - `t1 <
