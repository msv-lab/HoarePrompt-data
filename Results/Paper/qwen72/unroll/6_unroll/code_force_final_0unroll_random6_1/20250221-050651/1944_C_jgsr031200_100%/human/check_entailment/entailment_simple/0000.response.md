Reasoning:

The program aims to solve a game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from an array `a` to form a new array `c`, with Alice starting first. The goal is to determine the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after all elements have been picked, assuming both players play optimally.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a frequency list `freq` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - It iterates through `arr` and updates the frequency list accordingly.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program then iterates through the frequency list to determine the MEX of the array `c` that would be formed by the optimal play of Alice and Bob.
   - The logic is based on the observation that if an integer `i` appears at least twice in `arr`, it will definitely be in `c` because Alice can always choose it on her turn, and Bob cannot prevent it from being in `c`.
   - The program counts the number of unique integers (`cou`) that appear exactly once in `arr`.
   - If `cou` reaches 2, or if an integer `i` does not appear in `arr` (i.e., `freq[i] == 0`), the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Frequency Calculation**:
  - The frequency list `freq` is correctly initialized and updated based on the elements in `arr`.

- **Optimal Strategy Implementation**:
  - The program correctly identifies that if an integer appears at least twice, it will be in `c`.
  - The program also correctly identifies that if two unique integers appear exactly once, the MEX will be the next integer that does not appear in `arr`.
  - The program prints the first integer `i` that either does not appear in `arr` or is the second unique integer that appears exactly once.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where all integers in `arr` are unique and appear exactly once.
  - It also handles the case where all integers in `arr` appear at least twice.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` formed by the optimal play of Alice and Bob. The reasoning and implementation align with the problem description and the optimal strategy for both players.

Correctness: **True**
