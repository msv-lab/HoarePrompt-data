Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
1
2 3
```
According to the problem description, Alice and Bob play optimally. Here's how the game should proceed:

1. **Alice's Turn:**
   - Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob.
   - After swapping, Alice has 3 coins, and Bob has 2 coins.
   - Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet.
   - Now, Alice has 2 coins, and Bob has 2 coins.

2. **Bob's Turn:**
   - Bob can choose to swap wallets with Alice.
   - After swapping, Bob has 2 coins, and Alice has 2 coins.
   - Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet.
   - Now, Bob has 1 coin, and Alice has 2 coins.

3. **Alice's Turn:**
   - Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob.
   - After swapping, Alice has 1 coin, and Bob has 2 coins.
   - Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet.
   - Now, Alice has 0 coins, and Bob has 2 coins.

4. **Bob's Turn:**
   - Bob can choose to swap wallets with Alice.
   - After swapping, Bob has 0 coins, and Alice has 2 coins.
   - Bob cannot make a move because his wallet is empty.

In this scenario, Alice wins. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Bob" for this case. This is because the program does not correctly account for the optimal strategies that Alice and Bob can use, especially in cases where the number of coins is small and the parity of the coins is crucial.

The logic in the program is flawed in several ways:
- It incorrectly assumes that if `a == b`, Bob will always win, which is not necessarily true.
- It incorrectly handles the cases where `a` and `b` are both even or both odd.
- It does not correctly simulate the optimal play for both players, especially in cases where the number of coins is small.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
