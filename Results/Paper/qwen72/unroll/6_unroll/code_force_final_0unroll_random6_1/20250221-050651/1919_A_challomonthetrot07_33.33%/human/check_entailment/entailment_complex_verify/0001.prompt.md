You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')

            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `a` and `b` are read from input and the loop prints 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the conditions specified. After all iterations, the values of `a` and `b` are not retained and are reset for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `T` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= T <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) from the input. Based on the values of `a` and `b`, it prints either 'Bob' or 'Alice' according to the following rules: if `a` equals `b`, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is 1, it prints 'Alice'; if `b` is 1, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is odd, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints 'Alice'; if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value, and the values of `a` and `b` are reset for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `a == b`**
     - If both players have the same number of coins, Bob will always win. This is because Alice will always be the first to make a move, and if both wallets have the same number of coins, Alice will be forced to make a move that leaves Bob with the same number of coins. This pattern continues until both wallets are empty, and Alice will be the one unable to make a move.
   - **Case 2: `a == 1`**
     - If Alice has only 1 coin, she will always win. This is because she can swap wallets with Bob on her first move, and Bob will be left with 1 coin. Bob will then be forced to remove the coin, leaving Alice with the empty wallet, and Bob will be unable to make a move.
   - **Case 3: `b == 1`**
     - If Bob has only 1 coin, Bob will always win. This is because Alice will be forced to remove a coin from her wallet, and Bob can swap wallets with Alice on his turn, leaving Alice with 1 coin. Alice will then be forced to remove the coin, and Bob will win.
   - **Case 4: `a % 2 == 1`**
     - If Alice has an odd number of coins, Bob will always win. This is because Alice will always be the first to make a move, and she will be forced to remove a coin, making her number of coins even. Bob can then swap wallets with Alice, leaving Alice with an even number of coins. This pattern continues until Alice is left with 1 coin, and Bob will win.
   - **Case 5: `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`**
     - If Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice will always win. This is because Alice can swap wallets with Bob on her first move, leaving Bob with an even number of coins. Bob will then be forced to remove a coin, making his number of coins odd again. Alice can then swap wallets back, and this pattern continues until Bob is left with 1 coin, and Alice will win.
   - **Case 6: `a > b`**
     - If Alice has more coins than Bob, Bob will always win. This is because Alice will be forced to remove a coin, and Bob can swap wallets with Alice on his turn, leaving Alice with fewer coins. This pattern continues until Alice is left with 1 coin, and Bob will win.
   - **Case 7: `a < b`**
     - If Alice has fewer coins than Bob, Alice will always win. This is because Alice can swap wallets with Bob on her first move, and Bob will be forced to remove a coin from his wallet. This pattern continues until Bob is left with 1 coin, and Alice will win.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem. However, there is a logical error in the case where `a > b`. The program incorrectly assumes that Bob will always win if `a > b`, but this is not always true. For example, if `a = 4` and `b = 2`, Alice can win by swapping wallets and then removing coins optimally.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            if a > b:
                print('Bob')
            else:
                print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even and `a > b` correctly. The corrected program should be used instead.
