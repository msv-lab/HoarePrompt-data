### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for \( k \) consecutive bridges on a grid of \( n \) rows and \( m \) columns.
   - Each bridge must have supports installed in the first and last columns, and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \( d \).
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell \((i, j)\) is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row, d)`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports in a single row.
   - It initializes the cost for the first column to 1 (since \( a_{i,1} = 0 \)).
   - It then iterates over the first \( d \) columns, adding 2 to the cost of each cell (1 for the support and 1 for the depth).
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum costs of the first \( d \) columns.
   - For each subsequent column, it ensures that the distance between supports is no more than \( d \) by popping elements from the heap that are too far away.
   - It then adds the minimum cost from the heap to the current cell's cost and updates the heap with the new cost.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last column, which should be the minimum cost for the entire row.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input for \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \).
   - It reads the grid of \( n \) rows and \( m \) columns.
   - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then computes the total cost for each possible set of \( k \) consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read correctly using `input().split(' ')` and converting the elements to integers.
   - The grid is read correctly into a list of lists.
   - The output is printed correctly for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the constraints given in the problem, including the maximum values for \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \).
   - It ensures that the first and last columns always have supports installed, and the distance between supports is no more than \( d \).

6. **Complexity**:
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the function efficiently finds the minimum cost for each row.
   - The overall complexity is reasonable given the constraints, making the solution practical.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for \( k \) consecutive bridges on a grid. It handles the input and output as required and ensures that the constraints are met.

**Correctness: True**
