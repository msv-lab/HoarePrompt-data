Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers where the first and last integers in each row are 0, representing the river banks. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code reads `n` lines of input, each line containing `m` integers separated by spaces, and stores these integers in the list `rows`. Each sublist in `rows` contains `m` integers, and the first and last integers in each sublist are 0, as specified in the initial state. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are not modified by the code, so they remain the same.
