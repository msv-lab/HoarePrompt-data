To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to run.

### Loop Head Analysis:
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
```
- The loop variable `i` will iterate over the range from 0 to `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- `len(costs) - (k - 1) > 0`
- This simplifies to `len(costs) > k - 1`
- Therefore, `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from input with the given constraints.
- `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers.
- `costs` is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of calling `func_1` on each row in `rows` with the parameter `d`.
- `total_costs` is an empty list.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop depends on the length of `costs` and the value of `k`.
- To ensure the loop executes, `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.
- The loop variable `i` should start at 0.

### Final State:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from input with the given constraints.
- `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers.
- `costs` is a list of integers with a length of at least `k`.
- `total_costs` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from input with the given constraints, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers, `costs` is a list of integers with a length of at least `k`, `total_costs` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
