To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs` are defined but their specific values are not provided.
   - `total_costs` is a list where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, which means it contains sums of all possible `k`-length sublists of `costs`.

2. **Understanding `total_costs`:**
   - If `costs` is a list of integers, and `k` is a positive integer, then `total_costs` will be a list of sums of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.
   - For example, if `costs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 2`, then `total_costs` would be `[3, 5, 7, 9]` because:
     - `1 + 2 = 3`
     - `2 + 3 = 5`
     - `3 + 4 = 7`
     - `4 + 5 = 9`

3. **Finding the Minimum:**
   - The `min(total_costs)` function will find the smallest value in the `total_costs` list.
   - Since `total_costs` is a list of sums of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`, the minimum value in `total_costs` will be the smallest sum of any `k` consecutive elements in `costs`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.

Given the initial state and the structure of the problem, the output will be the minimum value in the `total_costs` list, which is the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the smallest sum of k consecutive elements in the costs list)**
