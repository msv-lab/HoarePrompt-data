### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The main program loop reads the number of test cases and iterates over them.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and then reads `n` rows of the river grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is responsible for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It initializes the first element of the row to 1 and increments the first `d` elements by 2.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within a sliding window of size `d`.
   - For each element from `d` to the end of the row, it updates the cost based on the minimum cost from the sliding window.
   - The function returns the cost of the last element in the row, which is the total cost of installing supports for that row.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input for a single test case and constructs the river grid.
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to compute the cost of installing supports for that row.
   - It then computes the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly initializes the first element to 1 and increments the first `d` elements by 2, which accounts for the cost of installing supports at the river banks and the first `d` columns.
  - The use of a min-heap ensures that the minimum cost within the sliding window is efficiently found.
  - The cost update for each element from `d` to the end of the row is correct, as it adds the minimum cost from the sliding window plus 1 to the current element's cost.
  - The function returns the correct total cost for the row.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The function correctly reads the input and constructs the river grid.
  - It applies `func_1` to each row to compute the individual costs.
  - It then computes the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
  - The minimum total cost is correctly found and printed.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges on the river grid. Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and meet the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
