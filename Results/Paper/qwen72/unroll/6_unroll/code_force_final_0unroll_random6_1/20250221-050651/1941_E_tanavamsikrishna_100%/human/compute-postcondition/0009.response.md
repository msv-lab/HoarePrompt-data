Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` (integers) and a list `rows` (a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers with the first and last integers being 0). It computes the minimum sum of `k` consecutive elements from a list of costs, where each cost is the result of applying `func_1` to each row in `rows` with the parameter `d`. The function prints this minimum sum and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, and `total_costs` are defined, with `total_costs` containing the sums of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`. **
