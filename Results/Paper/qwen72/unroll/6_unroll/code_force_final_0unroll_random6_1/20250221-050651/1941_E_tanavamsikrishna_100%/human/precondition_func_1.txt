No variables are passed in the function signature, but the function reads input values where n, m, k, and d are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. rows is a list of n lists, each containing m integers where the first and last integers in each row are 0, representing the river banks.
