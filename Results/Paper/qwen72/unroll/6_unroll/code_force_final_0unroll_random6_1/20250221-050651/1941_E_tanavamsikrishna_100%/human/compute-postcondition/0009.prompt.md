You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed in the function signature, but the function reads input values where n, m, k, and d are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. rows is a list of n lists, each containing m integers where the first and last integers in each row are 0, representing the river banks.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, and `total_costs` where `total_costs` is a list of sums of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`. The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the structure of the problem, the output will be the minimum value in the `total_costs` list, which is the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` (integers) and a list `rows` (a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers with the first and last integers being 0). It returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
