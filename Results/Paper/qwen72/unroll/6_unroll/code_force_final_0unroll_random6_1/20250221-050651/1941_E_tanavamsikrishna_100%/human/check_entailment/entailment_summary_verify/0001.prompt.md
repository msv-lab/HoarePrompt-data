You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

- Program:
from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush
#Function 1:
def func_1(row, d: int):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
    min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
    return row[-1]

    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` (integers) and a list `rows` (a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers with the first and last integers being 0). It computes the minimum sum of `k` consecutive elements from a list of costs, where each cost is the result of applying `func_1` to each row in `rows` with the parameter `d`. The function prints this minimum sum and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, and `total_costs` are defined, with `total_costs` containing the sums of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid representing a river.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a single bridge on a given row.
   - It initializes the cost for the first `d` cells by adding 2 to each cell (1 for the support and 1 for the cost).
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost for the next `d` cells.
   - For each cell beyond the first `d` cells, it pops the minimum cost from the heap that is within the distance `d` and adds the current cell's cost to it.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the total cost for the row.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid of river depths.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
   - It prints the minimum total cost for each test case.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read using `input().split(' ')` and converted to integers.
   - The grid is read row by row and stored in a list of lists.
   - The output is printed for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the grid is small and the number of bridges is large.
   - The function ensures that the first and last columns always have supports, as required by the problem.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the function efficiently finds the minimum cost for each cell within the distance `d`.
   - The overall complexity is manageable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the logic for calculating the minimum cost for each row and the total cost for `k` consecutive bridges is sound.
