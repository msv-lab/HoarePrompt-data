### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid representing a river.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `row[0] = 1`: This sets the cost for the first cell to 1, which is correct because the first cell always has a depth of 0, and the cost to install a support is `0 + 1 = 1`.
     - `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2`: This adds 2 to each cell in the range 1 to `d-1`. This is incorrect because it adds 2 to each cell, which should be `a_{i, j} + 1` for the support cost. The correct initialization should be `row[i] = row[i] + 1`.
   - **Min-Heap**:
     - `min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]:` This initializes the min-heap with the first `d` cells, which is correct.
     - `heapify(min_heap)`: This converts the list into a min-heap, which is correct.
   - **Processing Remaining Cells**:
     - `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2): pass`: This loop is intended to remove elements from the heap that are out of the range `d`. However, the condition `i - (d + 2)` should be `i - d - 1` to correctly handle the distance.
     - `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`: This correctly adds the minimum cost from the heap to the current cell's cost plus 1.
     - `heappush(min_heap, e)`: This pushes the minimum cost back into the heap, which is correct.
     - `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))`: This pushes the updated cost of the current cell into the heap, which is correct.
   - **Return Value**:
     - `return row[-1]`: This returns the cost of the last cell, which is correct.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Input Reading**:
     - `n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))`: This correctly reads the input values.
     - `rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]`: This correctly reads the grid of river depths.
   - **Cost Calculation**:
     - `costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]`: This correctly calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - **Total Cost Calculation**:
     - `total_costs = []`: This initializes the list to store the total costs.
     - `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)): total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))`: This correctly calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges and appends it to the list.
   - **Output**:
     - `print(min(total_costs))`: This correctly prints the minimum total cost for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the grid is small and the number of bridges is large.
   - The function ensures that the first and last columns always have supports, as required by the problem.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the function efficiently finds the minimum cost for each cell within the distance `d`.
   - The overall complexity is manageable given the constraints.

### Final Evaluation:

- **Initialization in `func_1`**:
  - The initialization `row[i] = row[i] + 2` for `i` in the range 1 to `d-1` is incorrect. It should be `row[i] = row[i] + 1` to correctly reflect the cost of installing a support.
- **Distance Condition in `func_1`**:
  - The condition `i - (d + 2)` should be `i - d - 1` to correctly handle the distance between supports.

Given these issues, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
