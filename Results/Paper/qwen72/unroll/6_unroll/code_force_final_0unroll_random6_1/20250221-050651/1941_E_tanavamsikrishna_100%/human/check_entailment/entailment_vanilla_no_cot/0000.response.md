Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Initialization in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes the first element of the row with `row[0] = 1`. This is incorrect because the first element of each row is always `0` (as per the problem statement, it represents the river bank). The cost of installing a support in the first cell should be `a_{i,1} + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`, but this should not be hardcoded. Instead, the cost should be calculated correctly for each cell.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` adds `2` to the cost of the first `d` cells. This is incorrect because the cost of installing a support in a cell is `a_{i,j} + 1`, not `a_{i,j} + 2`.

3. **Heap Management**:
   - The heap management in `func_1` is not optimal. The condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - d - 1` to ensure that the distance between supports is no more than `d`.

4. **Final Cost Calculation**:
   - The final cost calculation in `func_1` should be `row[-1] + 1` because the last cell also has a depth of `0` and the cost of installing a support there is `0 + 1 = 1`.

5. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` should handle multiple test cases, but it only processes one test case. It should be wrapped in a loop to handle all test cases.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush

# Function to calculate the minimum cost for a single row
def func_1(row, d: int):
    n = len(row)
    row[0] = 1  # Cost of installing a support in the first cell
    row[n-1] = 1  # Cost of installing a support in the last cell
    min_heap = [(row[i] + 1, i) for i in range(d + 1)]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d + 1, n):
        while min_heap[0][1] < i - d - 1:
            heappop(min_heap)
        row[i] += min_heap[0][0]
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
    return row[-1]

# Function to handle multiple test cases
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k, d = map(int, input().split())
        rows = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
        total_costs = [sum(costs[i:i + k]) for i in range(n - k + 1)]
        print(min(total_costs))

# Call the function to handle the test cases
func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The first and last cells of each row are correctly initialized with a cost of `1` (since `a_{i,1} = 0` and `a_{i,m} = 0`).

2. **Heap Management**:
   - The heap is correctly managed to ensure that the distance between supports is no more than `d`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost of installing a support in each cell is correctly calculated as `a_{i,j} + 1`.

4. **Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2` now handles multiple test cases by wrapping the processing in a loop.

This corrected program should now correctly solve the problem as described.
