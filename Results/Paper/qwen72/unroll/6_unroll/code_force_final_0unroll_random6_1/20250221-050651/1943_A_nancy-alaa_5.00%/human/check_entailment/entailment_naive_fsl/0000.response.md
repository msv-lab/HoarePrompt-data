Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `arr` contains all elements from 0 to `n-1` exactly once. In such a scenario, the MEX of the array `c` should be `n`, but the program will incorrectly print `n-1`.

Example input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

Expected output:
```
5
```

Actual output:
```
4
```

In this case, Alice and Bob will each pick one element from the array, and the final array `c` will contain all elements from 0 to 4. The MEX of `c` should be 5, but the program will print 4, which is incorrect.
