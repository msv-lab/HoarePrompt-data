### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to an array `c` and Bob just removes the chosen element.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after all elements are removed from `a`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to ensure that the smallest possible integers are not included in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob wants to ensure that the smallest possible integers are included in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - The key is to determine which integers can be excluded from `c` by the end of the game.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the range from `0` to `n-1` to find the smallest integer that is not in `a` or appears only once in `a` (and has been chosen by Alice).

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
     - `first` is a boolean flag initialized to `False`.

   - **Main Loop:**
     - The program iterates through the integers from `0` to `n-1`.
     - If an integer `i` is not in `mpp`, it means `i` is not present in `a`, and thus the MEX is `i`. The program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If `i` is in `mpp` and appears only once, and `first` is `True`, it means Alice has already chosen an integer that appears only once, and Bob will choose the next one. The program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If `i` is in `mpp` and appears only once, and `first` is `False`, it means Alice will choose this integer. The program sets `first` to `True`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not in `a` or appears only once and has been chosen by Alice.
   - The logic ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by following the rules of the game.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for both players.

**Correctness: True**
