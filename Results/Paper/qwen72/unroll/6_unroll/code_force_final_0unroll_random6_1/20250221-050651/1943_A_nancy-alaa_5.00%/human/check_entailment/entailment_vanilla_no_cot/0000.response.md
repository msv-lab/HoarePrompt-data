Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game and MEX**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest possible integers in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest possible integers by removing them from `a`.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the range from 0 to `n-1` to determine the MEX of the array `c`.
   - The variable `first` is used to track whether Alice has encountered a unique element (i.e., an element that appears only once in `a`).

4. **Steps in the Program**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the size `n` and the array `a`.
   - It creates a `Counter` object `mpp` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If the current integer `i` is not in `mpp`, it means `i` is the MEX of the array `c`, and the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `i` is in `mpp` and appears only once, and `first` is `True`, it means Bob has already removed one unique element, so the current `i` is the MEX of `c`, and the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `i` is in `mpp` and appears only once, and `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True` to indicate that Alice has encountered a unique element.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` by considering the optimal moves of both players.
   - It ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by checking the presence and count of each integer in the array `a`.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
