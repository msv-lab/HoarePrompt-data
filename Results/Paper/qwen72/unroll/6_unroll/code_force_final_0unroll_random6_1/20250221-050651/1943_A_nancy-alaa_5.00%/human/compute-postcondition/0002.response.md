The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it is inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, representing the elements of the list.

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, but typically, a function with these parameters would return some result based on the processing of the list `a` for each test case. Without additional context, the exact return value cannot be determined, but it is likely to be a result or a list of results corresponding to the test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the length of the list), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It processes the list `a` for each test case and returns a result or a list of results based on the processed data.**
