Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then immediately calls `func_1()` in a loop. However, `func_1()` is defined after the loop, which will cause a `NameError` because the function is not defined at the time it is called.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined after the loop where it is called, which is incorrect in Python. Functions should be defined before they are called.

3. **Set and Sorting**: The program converts the input list of integers into a set, which removes duplicate values. This is incorrect because the game logic depends on the number of piles and their sizes, and removing duplicates changes the game state.

4. **Logic for Determining the Winner**: The logic used to determine the winner is flawed. The program subtracts the cumulative sum of the previous elements from each element in the sorted list, which does not correctly simulate the game's rules. The game involves removing the same number of stones from all nonempty piles, and the winner is determined by the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the winner, you need to count the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If this count is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is because the player who faces an even number of piles with an odd number of stones will always be able to make a move that leaves an odd number of such piles for the opponent, and vice versa.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    odd_count = sum(1 for num in nums if num % 2 == 1)
    if odd_count % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

This corrected program correctly handles the input, counts the number of piles with an odd number of stones, and determines the winner based on the parity of this count.
