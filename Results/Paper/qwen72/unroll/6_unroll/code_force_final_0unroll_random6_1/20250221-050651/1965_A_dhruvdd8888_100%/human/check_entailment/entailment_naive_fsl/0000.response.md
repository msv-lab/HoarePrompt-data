Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input and output correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is called within a loop, but the loop and the function `func_1` are not properly structured to read and process multiple test cases. Additionally, the logic within `func_1` is flawed:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is called inside a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. However, the function `func_1` itself does not read the input for the number of piles `N` and the pile sizes `nums` properly. The `rrr` variable and the `randint` function are unnecessary and do not contribute to the solution.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The program uses a set to store the pile sizes, which can remove duplicates. This is incorrect because the problem requires considering the actual number of stones in each pile, not just unique pile sizes. The logic for determining the winner is also flawed. The program attempts to subtract the cumulative sum of stones from each pile, but this does not correctly simulate the game's rules.

3. **Example Case**: Consider the input:
   ```
   1
   3
   1 2 3
   ```
   The correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can remove 1 stone from each pile on her first turn, leaving Bob with piles of sizes 0, 1, and 2. Bob will then be forced to remove 1 stone from each non-empty pile, leaving Alice with piles of sizes 0, 0, and 1. Alice can then remove the last stone and win. However, the given program will output "Bob" due to the flawed logic and input handling.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
