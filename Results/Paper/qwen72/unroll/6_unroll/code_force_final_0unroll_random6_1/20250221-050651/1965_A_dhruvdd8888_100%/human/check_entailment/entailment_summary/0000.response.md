Reasoning:

The provided program has a few issues that affect its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is called in a loop, but it is not defined until after the loop. This will cause a runtime error because the function is being called before it is defined.

2. **Set Conversion**: The program converts the input list of pile sizes into a set to remove duplicates. However, in the game, the number of piles and their sizes are crucial, and removing duplicates changes the game's state. For example, if the input is `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the set will be `{0, 3}`, which is incorrect for the game's logic.

3. **Cumulative Sum Logic**: The program modifies the `nums` list by subtracting a cumulative sum `ls` from each element. This step is intended to simulate the removal of stones, but it is not correctly implemented. The logic of the game requires that a player can remove a certain number of stones from all non-empty piles, not just from a cumulative sum.

4. **Winning Condition**: The program uses a boolean toggle (`cw` and `nw`) to determine the winner based on the presence of `1` in the modified `nums` list. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the game's rules. The game's outcome should be determined by the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones, not by the presence of `1` in a modified list.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the winner of the game, we need to focus on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of such piles is odd, Alice wins; if it is even, Bob wins. This is because each player can always remove an odd number of stones from all non-empty piles, and the player who faces an even number of odd piles will eventually lose.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    odd_piles = sum(1 for x in nums if x % 2 == 1)
    if odd_piles % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is defined before it is called in the loop.
- **Odd Piles Count**: The program counts the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
- **Winning Condition**: The winner is determined based on the parity of the number of odd piles.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the original program and the corrected approach, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
