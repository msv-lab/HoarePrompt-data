The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from the input, which represents the number of unique piles of stones. It then reads a list of integers from the input, converts it to a set to remove duplicates, adds `0` to the set, and sorts the resulting set into a list `nums`. The function modifies `nums` such that each element is reduced by a cumulative sum `ls` of the previous elements, effectively setting each element to 0. It then determines the winner of a game based on the modified `nums` list and prints either "Alice" or "Bob" as the winner. The function does not return any value and does not modify the original `t`, `n`, or `piles` variables. After the function concludes, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers where each element is 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list, and `cw` and `nw` are boolean variables indicating the game's outcome.
