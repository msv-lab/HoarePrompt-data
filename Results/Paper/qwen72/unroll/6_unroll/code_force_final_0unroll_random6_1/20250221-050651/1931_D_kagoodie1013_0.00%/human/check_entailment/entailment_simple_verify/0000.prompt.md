You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs as described in the problem. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed because it incorrectly uses the modulo operations to count pairs. Specifically, the program uses `mod_x = -num % x` and `mod_y = num % y` to count pairs, but this does not correctly handle the conditions for a pair to be beautiful.

For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful, both conditions must be met:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

However, the current implementation only checks the modulo of individual elements, which does not ensure that the sum and difference of pairs meet the required conditions. 

For example, consider the test case:
```
n = 4, x = 3, y = 2, arr = [1, 2, 4, 5]
```
The pairs \(\langle 1, 4 \rangle\) and \(\langle 2, 5 \rangle\) should be beautiful:
- \(1 + 5 = 6\) (divisible by 3) and \(1 - 5 = -4\) (divisible by 2).
- \(2 + 4 = 6\) (divisible by 3) and \(2 - 4 = -2\) (divisible by 2).

However, the program will not correctly count these pairs because it does not check the sum and difference conditions directly. Instead, it relies on incorrect modulo operations and accumulates counts in a way that does not reflect the problem requirements.
