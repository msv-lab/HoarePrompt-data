The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and the list `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will be assigned the values from the first tuple in `test_cases` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list**
