**Reasoning:**

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by extracting `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` from the list of strings.
   - This part is correctly implemented and ensures that the input is parsed as expected.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a `count` variable to zero.
   - It also initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of elements based on their remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

3. **Pair Counting:**
   - The program iterates through each element `num` in the array `arr`.
   - For each element, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y` as `-num % x` and `num % y`, respectively.
   - It then increments the `count` by the sum of the values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` corresponding to the calculated `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - Finally, it updates the `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the correct keys and values.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the `count` to the `results` list for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

**Issues:**
- The program's logic for counting pairs is incorrect. Specifically, the conditions for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful are:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
- The current implementation only checks the remainders of individual elements and does not correctly account for the pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where both conditions are met.
- The program should instead use a nested loop to check all pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (where \(1 \le i < j \le n\)) and count the pairs that satisfy both conditions.

**Correct Implementation:**
To correctly count the beautiful pairs, the program should use a nested loop to check all pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) and count those that satisfy both conditions. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (arr[i] + arr[j]) % x == 0 and (arr[i] - arr[j]) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

**Conclusion:**
- The given program does not correctly count the beautiful pairs as defined in the problem statement.
- Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
