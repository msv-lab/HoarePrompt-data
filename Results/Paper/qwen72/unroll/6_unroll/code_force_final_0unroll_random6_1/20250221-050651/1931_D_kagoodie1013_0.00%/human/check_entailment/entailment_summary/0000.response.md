Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on the given conditions. However, there is a critical issue with the logic in the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to count pairs (i, j) where both conditions are met simultaneously, but the current implementation counts pairs where either condition is met. This is evident from the line:

```python
count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
```

This line adds the counts of pairs that satisfy the first condition and the counts of pairs that satisfy the second condition, which is incorrect. Instead, the program should count pairs (i, j) where both conditions are satisfied.

Additionally, the way the program is handling the modulo operations and the maps (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The program should check for pairs (i, j) where both `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

To correct this, the program should use a different approach to count the pairs that satisfy both conditions. One possible approach is to use a nested loop to iterate over all pairs (i, j) and check both conditions explicitly.

Given the current implementation, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs as defined in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
