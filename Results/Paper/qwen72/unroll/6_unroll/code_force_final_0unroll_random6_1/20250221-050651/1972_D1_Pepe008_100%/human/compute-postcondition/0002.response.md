Output State: **The value of `T` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop has executed, and `suma` is printed for each iteration with the final value of `suma - 2` for each pair of inputs `(a, b)`. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged.**

However, since `T` is the number of iterations and it is not modified within the loop, the output state for `T` remains the same as the initial state. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected by the loop and thus remain unchanged. The loop prints a value for `suma - 2` for each iteration, but `suma` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration.

So, the output state in natural language is:

Output State: **The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. The loop prints a value for `suma - 2` for each of the `T` iterations, but `T` itself remains the same as the initial value.**
