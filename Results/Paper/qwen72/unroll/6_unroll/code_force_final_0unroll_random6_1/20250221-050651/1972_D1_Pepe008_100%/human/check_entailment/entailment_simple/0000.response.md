### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**:
   - The program iterates over each test case using a for loop.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over `i` from 1 to `b` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x` as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - If `x` is greater than 0, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - Additionally, it checks if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`. If both conditions are true, it increments `suma` by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints `suma - 2` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
  - `a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b)` for some integer `k`.
  - This implies that `a` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b) - b`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The calculation of `x` and the conditions inside the loop do not directly correspond to the problem's requirement.
- The condition `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is not relevant to the problem's requirement.
- The final output `suma - 2` is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirement.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The conditions and the final output are incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
