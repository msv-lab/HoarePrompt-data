### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The given program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It initializes a variable `suma` to 0, which will store the count of valid pairs.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\) (inclusive).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) as \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - If \(x > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Additionally, it checks if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\), and if both conditions are true, it adds 1 to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

3. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies \(a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\).
   - The program's approach to calculate \(x\) as \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is not aligned with the mathematical condition. This formula seems to be an attempt to count valid \(a\) values for each \(b\), but it is not clear why this specific formula is used.
   - The additional check \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is not necessary and does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - Subtracting 2 from `suma` at the end is not justified and may lead to incorrect results.

4. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) does not correctly count the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). It is not clear how this formula relates to the problem's condition.
   - The additional check \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is not necessary and does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - Subtracting 2 from `suma` at the end is not justified and may lead to incorrect results. This subtraction is likely a bug or a misunderstanding of the problem.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Alternatively, a more efficient approach would involve using properties of the gcd and modular arithmetic to reduce the number of operations.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The formula used and the additional checks are not justified and do not align with the problem's requirements. The subtraction of 2 at the end is also not justified and may lead to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
