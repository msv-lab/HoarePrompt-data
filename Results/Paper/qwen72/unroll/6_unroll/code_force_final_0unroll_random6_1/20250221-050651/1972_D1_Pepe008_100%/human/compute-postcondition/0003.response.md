The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function requires two positive integers, `n` and `m`, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `m` within the specified range and return a value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 and returns a value based on these inputs.**
