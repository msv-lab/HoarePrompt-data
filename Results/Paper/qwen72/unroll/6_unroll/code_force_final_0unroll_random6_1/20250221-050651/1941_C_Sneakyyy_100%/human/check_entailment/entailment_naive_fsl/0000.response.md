Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the substrings "pie" or "map" overlap. For example, consider the string "pipie". The program will only count one occurrence of "pie" and one occurrence of "map", but it should actually remove characters to handle both overlapping substrings. The correct output for "pipie" should be 2 (removing the 2nd and 4th characters to make the string "piee"), but the program will output 1.
