The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is based on the integer `n` and the string `s` provided in the tuple.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the provided `n` and `s`.**
