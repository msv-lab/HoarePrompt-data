### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of making a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map". The program iterates through each test case, reads the length of the string and the string itself, and then checks for occurrences of the substrings "pie" or "map". If such a substring is found, the program increments the `ans` counter and skips the next three characters. The final value of `ans` is printed for each test case.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Increment of `ans`**:
   - The program increments `ans` by 1 for each occurrence of "pie" or "map". This is incorrect because the number of characters to be removed should be 3 for each occurrence, not 1. For example, if the string is "mappppie", the program will output 2, but the correct answer should be 6 (3 characters for "map" and 3 characters for "pie").

2. **Handling Overlapping Substrings**:
   - The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, if the string is "mappie", the program will only remove one occurrence of "map" and one occurrence of "pie", but the correct approach should be to remove the overlapping characters in a way that minimizes the total number of deletions. The program will output 2, but the correct answer should be 3 (remove "map" and then "pie" from the remaining string).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the string length is less than 3. In such cases, the string is always beautiful, and the program should output 0. However, the program does not explicitly check for this condition.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is **incorrect**.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        
        # Initialize the answer to 0
        ans = 0
        
        # Use a list to keep track of the characters to be removed
        to_remove = []
        
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                to_remove.extend([i, i + 1, i + 2])
                i += 3
            else:
                i += 1
        
        # Remove the characters and count the number of deletions
        a = ''.join(a[j] for j in range(len(a)) if j not in to_remove)
        ans = len(to_remove)
        
        # Check for overlapping substrings
        while 'map' in a or 'pie' in a:
            if 'map' in a:
                index = a.index('map')
                to_remove.extend([index, index + 1, index + 2])
                a = a[:index] + a[index + 3:]
            if 'pie' in a:
                index = a.index('pie')
                to_remove.extend([index, index + 1, index + 2])
                a = a[:index] + a[index + 3:]
        
        ans = len(to_remove)
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of characters to be removed.
   - `to_remove` is a list that keeps track of the indices of characters to be removed.

2. **First Pass**:
   - The program iterates through the string and checks for the substrings "map" or "pie".
   - If a substring is found, the indices of the three characters are added to `to_remove`, and the index `i` is incremented by 3 to skip these characters.

3. **Second Pass**:
   - The program constructs a new string `a` by removing the characters at the indices in `to_remove`.
   - It then checks for overlapping substrings "map" or "pie" in the new string and continues to remove them until no such substrings are found.

4. **Output**:
   - The final number of characters to be removed is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect, and the corrected version is provided above.)
