### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Substring Detection and Counting:**
   - The function uses a while loop to iterate through the string `a` (which is the same as `s`).
   - It checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `a` by slicing the string in chunks of 3 characters.
   - If a substring "map" or "pie" is found, it increments the `ans` counter and skips the next 3 characters by setting `i += 3`.
   - If no such substring is found, it moves to the next character by setting `i += 1`.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the number of substrings "map" or "pie" found in the string `a`.

4. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The logic of incrementing `i` by 3 when a substring is found ensures that the function does not count overlapping occurrences of "map" or "pie" multiple times.
   - However, the function only counts the number of occurrences of "map" or "pie" and does not correctly compute the minimum number of characters to delete to make the string beautiful.

5. **Minimum Deletions Calculation:**
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum number of characters to delete to ensure that the string does not contain "map" or "pie" as substrings.
   - The current implementation only counts the number of occurrences of "map" or "pie" and assumes that each occurrence requires deleting 3 characters, which is incorrect.
   - For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the function will count 2 occurrences of "map" or "pie" and output 2, but the correct answer is 2 (deleting the 4th and 9th characters).

### Correctness:
**False**

The function does not correctly compute the minimum number of characters to delete to make the string beautiful. It only counts the number of occurrences of "map" or "pie" and assumes that each occurrence requires deleting 3 characters, which is incorrect. The correct approach would involve a more sophisticated algorithm to determine the minimum deletions required.
