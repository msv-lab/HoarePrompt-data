You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Program:
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads input from the standard input, processes each even-indexed line (excluding the first line) by splitting the line into tokens, and prints the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens for each processed line. The state of any external variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a deck of 2n cards, each card having an integer from 1 to n.
   - Each integer appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - The cards are distributed equally between you and Nene, each receiving n cards.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a common way to read from standard input in Python.
   - It processes every second line starting from the third line, which corresponds to the lines containing the card values in your hand.
   - For each line, it splits the line into tokens (card values) and calculates the number of unique card values using a set.
   - The result is the difference between the total number of cards in your hand and the number of unique card values.

3. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program calculates the number of duplicate card values in your hand, which is `len(tokens) - len(set(tokens))`.
   - This calculation is based on the idea that if you have a duplicate card value, you can score a point when you play the second card of that value.
   - However, this calculation does not consider the optimal play strategy of Nene, which is crucial for determining the maximum points you can score.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - To maximize your score, you should play the cards in such a way that you score points whenever possible.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - If you have a duplicate card value, you should play the first card of that value, and Nene will play the second card of that value on her turn to score a point.
   - Therefore, the maximum points you can score is the number of card values that appear exactly once in your hand.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program's logic is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal play strategy of Nene.
   - The correct approach should be to count the number of card values that appear exactly once in your hand, as these are the only cards that can potentially score points for you.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the optimal play strategy and does not account for Nene's optimal play. It simply counts the number of duplicates, which is not the correct way to determine the maximum points you can score.
