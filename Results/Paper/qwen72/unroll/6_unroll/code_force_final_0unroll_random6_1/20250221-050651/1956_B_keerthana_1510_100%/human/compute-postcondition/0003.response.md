Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads input from the standard input, processes each even-indexed line (excluding the first line) by splitting the line into tokens, and prints the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens for each processed line. The state of any external variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remains unchanged. **
