The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters. However, the specific return value or condition is not provided in the output description. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers, each between 1 and 10^7. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return condition is not provided.**
