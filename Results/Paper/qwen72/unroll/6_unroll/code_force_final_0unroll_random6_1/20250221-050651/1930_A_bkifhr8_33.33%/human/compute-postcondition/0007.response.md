Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). It then calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from the list and appends these sums to a list `ans_f`. Finally, it prints each integer in `ans_f`. The function does not return any value. **
