You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and a list of `2n` integers.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes a variable `ans` to store the score for the current test case.
   - It reads the input line and splits it into a list of strings `lst`.
   - It then iterates `n * 2` times, which is incorrect because it should only iterate `n` times (once for each pair).
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the length of `lst` is not 2. If it is not, it adds the minimum of the first two elements to `ans` and removes them from the list.
   - If the length of `lst` is 2, it adds the minimum of the two elements to `ans` and breaks the loop.

3. **Issues**:
   - The loop condition `for i in range(n * 2)` is incorrect. It should be `for i in range(n)` because you only need to perform the move `n` times.
   - The removal of elements from the list is incorrect. The program uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which are not the correct indices to remove the first two elements. It should use `lst.pop(0)` and `lst.pop(0)` to remove the first two elements.
   - The program does not handle the case where the list is empty after removing elements, which can lead to an error.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest elements together. This can be achieved by sorting the list and then summing the first `n` elements (since the first `n` elements will be the smallest and thus the minimum of each pair).
   - The correct logic would be to sort the list and then sum the first `n` elements.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
- **Sorting the List**: For each test case, it reads the list of `2n` integers, converts it to a list of integers, and sorts it.
- **Summing the First `n` Elements**: It then sums the first `n` elements of the sorted list, which are the smallest elements.
- **Storing and Printing Results**: The result for each test case is stored in `ans_f` and printed at the end.

This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the maximum possible score for each test case.
