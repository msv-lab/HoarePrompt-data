You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1.

    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `1 <= i < n-1`) is the smallest integer such that `ans[i] >= arr[i]` and `ans[i]` is a multiple of `ans[i-1]`, and the last element `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `1 <= i < n-1`) is the smallest integer such that `ans[i] >= arr[i]` and `ans[i]` is a multiple of `ans[i-1]`, and the last element `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` containing `n-1` elements.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to compute the array `ans` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `ans[0]` is greater than `arr[0]`, which is necessary for the modulo operation to produce `arr[0]` when `ans[1]` is divided by `ans[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the array `arr` from index 0 to `n-2`:
     - For each index `i`, it sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. This ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i]` and that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i]` will be `arr[i]`.
     - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it enters a while loop to increment `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This step is necessary to ensure that the modulo operation `ans[i + 2] % ans[i + 1]` can produce `arr[i + 1]`.
   - Finally, it sets `ans[-1]` to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`, ensuring that the last element of `ans` satisfies the condition `ans[-1] % ans[-2] = arr[-1]`.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly:
     - `1 <= t <= 10^4`
     - `2 <= n <= 500`
     - `1 <= x_i <= 500`
   - The values in `ans` are within the range `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.

4. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - The conditions `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for `2 <= i <= n` are satisfied by the construction of `ans`:
     - `ans[1] % ans[0] = arr[0]` because `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0]`.
     - For subsequent elements, `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] = arr[i]` because `ans[i + 1]` is constructed to be `arr[i] + ans[i]` or a multiple of `ans[i]` that is greater than `arr[i]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `ans` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
