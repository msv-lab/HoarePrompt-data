#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`, and for each `1 <= i < n`, `ans[i]` is the smallest integer such that `ans[i] >= arr[i]` and `ans[i]` is a multiple of `ans[i-1]`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `1 <= i < n-1`) is the smallest integer such that `ans[i] >= arr[i]` and `ans[i]` is a multiple of `ans[i-1]`, and the last element `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `1 <= i < n-1`) is the smallest integer such that `ans[i] >= arr[i]` and `ans[i]` is a multiple of `ans[i-1]`, and the last element `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
