The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is a list of integers where the length of `arr` is between 1 and 500, and each element in `arr` is between 1 and 500. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and the length of `arr` is exactly `n - 1`.

The function returns a list `ans` of length `n` where:
- The first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
- Each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `1 <= i < n-1`) is the smallest integer that is both greater than or equal to `arr[i]` and a multiple of `ans[i-1]`.
- The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of the second-to-last element `ans[-2]` and the last element of `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `arr` and a multiple of the previous element in `ans`, and the last element is the sum of the second-to-last element in `ans` and the last element in `arr`.**
