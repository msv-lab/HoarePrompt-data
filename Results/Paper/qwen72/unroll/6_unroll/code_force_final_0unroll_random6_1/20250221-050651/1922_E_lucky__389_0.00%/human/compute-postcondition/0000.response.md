Output State: **`t` is an integer in the range [1, 1000], `x` is an integer in the range [2, 10^18].** 

The initial state specifies that the function should take an integer `t` in the range [1, 1000] and for each test case, an integer `X` in the range [2, 10^18]. The code snippet `x = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `x`. Since this input is expected to be within the range [2, 10^18], the value of `x` is now an integer in that range. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer in the range [1, 1000].
