### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is a good choice to ensure that any valid cost will be less than this initial value.

3. **Loop Through the Queue:**
   - The program iterates through the queue from the last person to the first person using a for loop with `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`.
   - This loop is designed to simulate Kirill moving forward in the queue by bribing people.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - For each person `i` in the queue:
     - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of the current `pergunta` and the cost of moving to position `i` (which is `x + a[i]`).
     - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`. This step is crucial because it accounts for the cost of bribing the person at position `i` and the cost of bribing all people between the current position and the new position.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the minimum cost `pergunta` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic of the program is correct in that it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.
- The use of `min(a[i], b[i])` ensures that the program always chooses the cheaper option between bribing the person at position `i` and bribing the people between the current position and the new position.
- The update of `pergunta` ensures that the program keeps track of the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` people.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge case where `m` is equal to `n` correctly. In this case, Kirill can stay in his original position without any cost.
- The program also handles the case where `m` is 1 correctly, as it will only consider the cost of moving to the first position.

### Issues:
- **Function Call Issue:**
  - The function `func_1` is called with `pergunta` as an argument, but `pergunta` is not modified within the function. This means the initial value of `pergunta` (which is `float('inf')`) is passed to the function, and the function updates its local copy of `pergunta`. However, the updated value is not returned or used outside the function.
  - To fix this, the function should either return the updated `pergunta` or modify `pergunta` in place (which is not recommended in Python due to immutability of integers).

### Corrected Code:
```python
numCasos = int(input())
for i in range(numCasos):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pergunta = float('inf')
    pergunta = func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m)
    print(pergunta)

def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
    return pergunta
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was **inaccurate** because it did not account for the fact that the updated value of `pergunta` is not being used outside the function.
- The corrected code ensures that the updated value of `pergunta` is returned and printed correctly.

Final: **False**
