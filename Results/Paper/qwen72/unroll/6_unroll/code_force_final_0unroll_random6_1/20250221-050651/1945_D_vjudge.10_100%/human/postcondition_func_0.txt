The function `func_1` accepts an integer `pergunta`, a list of integers `a`, a list of integers `b`, an integer `n`, and an integer `m`. It calculates and prints the minimum total cost required for Kirill to bribe people in the queue to reach a position no greater than `m`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `pergunta` is updated to the minimum cost to bribe people to reach a position up to `m`, and `x` is the total cost of the minimum bribes from the last person to the first person in the queue.
