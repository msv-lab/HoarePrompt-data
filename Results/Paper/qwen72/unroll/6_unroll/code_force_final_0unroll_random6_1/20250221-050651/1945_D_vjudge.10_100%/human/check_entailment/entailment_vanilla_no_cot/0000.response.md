Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is called but does not actually perform the necessary logic to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. The function `func_1` should be integrated directly into the loop where the test cases are processed, and the logic for calculating the minimum cost should be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles the problem constraints and requirements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
numCasos = int(input())
for _ in range(numCasos):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    pergunta = float('inf')
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        x += b[i]
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
    
    print(pergunta)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: `pergunta` is initialized to infinity to ensure any valid cost will be less than this initial value. `x` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the total cost of bribes.
2. **Loop**: The loop iterates from the last person in the queue to the first person.
   - `x` is incremented by `b[i]` to account for the cost of bribing everyone between the current position and the position Kirill will move to.
   - If the current position `i` is less than `m`, it checks if moving to this position would result in a lower total cost (`x + a[i]`) and updates `pergunta` accordingly.
3. **Output**: After processing all positions, the minimum cost `pergunta` is printed for the current test case.

This corrected program ensures that Kirill's minimum cost to be among the first `m` people is calculated correctly for each test case.
