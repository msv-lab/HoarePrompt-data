### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, N).
   - The robot moves every second: first, it makes a move (left, right, up, or down), and then it follows the arrow in the current cell.
   - The grid is 2xN, and each cell contains an arrow pointing either left (`<`) or right (`>`).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The robot can only move to the right or down because it starts at (1, 1) and must reach (2, N).
   - The robot must eventually move to the second row to reach (2, N).
   - The robot can only move to the second row if there is a cell in the first row that points down (`>`).

3. **Critical Condition:**
   - The robot must be able to move to the second row and then move to the rightmost cell (2, N) without getting stuck.
   - The key condition is whether the robot can navigate to the rightmost cell (2, N) from any cell in the second row.

4. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows `a` and `b`.
   - The program checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) points to the left (`<`).
   - If `b[n - 2]` points to the left, the program prints "No".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

5. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The program's logic is based on the idea that if the second-to-last cell in the second row points to the left, the robot cannot move to the rightmost cell (2, N) because it will be stuck in the second-to-last cell.
   - However, this logic is incomplete. The robot can still reach (2, N) if it can move to the second row and then navigate to the rightmost cell using other arrows.

6. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     4
     >><<
     >>><
     ```
     - The robot starts at (1, 1) and can move to (1, 2) (following the arrow `>`, it moves to (1, 3)).
     - From (1, 3), it can move down to (2, 3) (following the arrow `>`, it moves to (2, 4)).
     - The robot reaches (2, 4), which is the rightmost cell.
   - The program would incorrectly print "No" because `b[n - 2]` (which is `b[2]`) points to the left (`<`).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible paths the robot can take to reach the rightmost cell in the second row. It only checks a single condition, which is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the solution.

Final: **False**
