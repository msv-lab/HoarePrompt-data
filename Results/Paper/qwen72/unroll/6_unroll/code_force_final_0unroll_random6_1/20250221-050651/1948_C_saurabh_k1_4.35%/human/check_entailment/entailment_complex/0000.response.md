Reasoning:

The provided function is intended to solve the problem of determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) in a 2xN grid with arrows pointing left or right. However, the function's logic is flawed. Specifically, the function only checks if the second-to-last character in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) is `<`. If it is, the function prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the full movement rules of the robot, which must move every second and follow the arrows in the current cell.

To correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), we need to simulate the robot's movements according to the given rules. The robot starts at (1, 1) and must move left, right, up, or down, and then follow the arrow in the current cell. The function should check if there is a valid sequence of moves that allows the robot to reach (2, n).

The provided function does not simulate the robot's movements and only checks a single condition, which is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the path. Therefore, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
