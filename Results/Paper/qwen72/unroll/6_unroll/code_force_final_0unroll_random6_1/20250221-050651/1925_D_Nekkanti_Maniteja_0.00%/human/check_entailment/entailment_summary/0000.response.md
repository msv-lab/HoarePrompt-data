Reasoning:

The problem involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for pairs of children chosen for excursions. The key points to consider are:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and initializes the necessary variables `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a`.

2. **Modulo Inverse Calculation**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.
   - The modular inverse is used to ensure that the probability of selecting a pair is correctly handled in modular arithmetic.

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The variable `a` is used to accumulate the initial friendship values of the `m` pairs of friends.
   - This is done correctly by iterating over the `m` pairs and summing their friendship values.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion is calculated in a loop over `k` excursions.
   - The formula used in the loop is `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - This formula is incorrect. The term `c * i * c * m` should not be part of the expected value calculation. The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase due to the selection of friend pairs.

5. **Expected Increase**:
   - The expected increase in the friendship value for each excursion is the probability of selecting a friend pair multiplied by the number of friend pairs, which is `c * m`.
   - The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions should be:
     \[
     s = k \cdot (c \cdot a + c \cdot m)
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     s = k \cdot (c \cdot (a + m))
     \]

6. **Final Output**:
   - The final value of `s` is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the incorrect formula used in the loop, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the excursions.

Correctness: **False**
