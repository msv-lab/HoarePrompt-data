You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        
        n, k = list(map(int, l1))
        
        arr = []
        
        k0 = k
        
        i = 0
        
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        
        ans = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all test cases. For each test case, the output is a list of integers `ans` of length `n`, where the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The elements in `ans` are powers of 2, and any remaining positions in the list are filled with zeros. The loop has finished executing, and all variables within the loop body have been reset for each new test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, and processes multiple test cases `t`. For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`. The function ensures that `n` is within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5 and `k` is within the range 1 to 10^9, and the total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
