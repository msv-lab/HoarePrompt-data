Output State: **The loop has processed all test cases. For each test case, the output is a list of integers `ans` of length `n`, where the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The elements in `ans` are powers of 2, and any remaining positions in the list are filled with zeros. The loop has finished executing, and all variables within the loop body have been reset for each new test case.**
