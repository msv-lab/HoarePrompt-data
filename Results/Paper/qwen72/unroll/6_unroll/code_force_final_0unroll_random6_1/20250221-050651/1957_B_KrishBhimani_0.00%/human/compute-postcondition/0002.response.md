The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, and processes multiple test cases `t`. For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`. The function ensures that `n` is within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5 and `k` is within the range 1 to 10^9, and the total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
