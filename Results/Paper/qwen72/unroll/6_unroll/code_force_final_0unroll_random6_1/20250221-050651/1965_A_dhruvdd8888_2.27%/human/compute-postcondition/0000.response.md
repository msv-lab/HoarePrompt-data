Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `piles` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ piles[i] ≤ 10^9, and `N` is an input integer. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.** 

The value of `N` is updated to the integer input provided by the user. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
