Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Call and Placement**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called inside the loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` before it is defined. This will result in a `NameError` because the function is not defined at the time of the call.
   - The function definition `def func_1():` should be placed before the loop where it is called.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Input**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads input directly using `input()`, which is not ideal when the function is called multiple times in a loop. It would be better to pass the input as arguments to the function.
   - The input is split and converted to a set, which removes duplicate values. This is incorrect because the number of piles and their sizes are important for the game logic.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The logic to determine the winner is flawed. The program checks if the number of distinct pile sizes is 1 or 2 and then uses a condition based on the difference between consecutive pile sizes. This does not correctly capture the game's rules.
   - The game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of piles with the smallest size. If the smallest pile size appears an odd number of times, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that should work correctly for the given problem:

```python
def determine_winner(piles):
    min_pile = min(piles)
    count_min_pile = piles.count(min_pile)
    if count_min_pile % 2 == 1:
        return 'Alice'
    else:
        return 'Bob'

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(determine_winner(piles))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function Definition**:
   - `determine_winner(piles)` takes a list of pile sizes and determines the winner.
   - It finds the minimum pile size and counts how many times it appears in the list.
   - If the count of the minimum pile size is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes.
   - It then calls `determine_winner(piles)` and prints the result.

This corrected program should correctly determine the winner for each test case based on the given problem description.
