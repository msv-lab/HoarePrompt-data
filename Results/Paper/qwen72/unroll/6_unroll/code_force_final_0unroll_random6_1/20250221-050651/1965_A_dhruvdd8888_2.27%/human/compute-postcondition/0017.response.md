The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided signature. However, given the context and the constraints mentioned, it is implied that the function operates based on some predefined or external inputs (like `t`, `n`, and `piles`), which are not directly passed as parameters to the function.

The function prints one of two strings, 'Alice' or 'Bob', depending on some internal logic or conditions, and always returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is:
Functionality: **The function prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on some internal logic and always returns `None`.**
