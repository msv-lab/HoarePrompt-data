The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `d`. `d` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= d <= n - 1, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. After executing the function body, the function returns two integers `v` and `u` provided by the user.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `d`, which is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to n-1, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. It returns two integers `v` and `u` provided by the user.**
