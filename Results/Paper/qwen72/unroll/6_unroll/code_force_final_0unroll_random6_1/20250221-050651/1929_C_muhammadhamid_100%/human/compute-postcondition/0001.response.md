Output State: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, k, x, and a are integers such that 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9. The loop has executed all iterations, and for each test case, it has printed 'Yes' if a is greater than or equal to the calculated value of s, otherwise it has printed 'No'. The values of k, x, and a for each test case remain unchanged.**
