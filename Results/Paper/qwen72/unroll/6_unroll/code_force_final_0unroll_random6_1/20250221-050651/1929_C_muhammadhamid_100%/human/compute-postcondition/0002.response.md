The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on or is called with some external input that includes `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, where:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.

The function returns different outputs based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each test case. However, the specific output conditions are not provided in the prompt. 

Functionality: **The function operates on multiple test cases, each defined by integers `k`, `x`, and `a` with specific constraints, and returns a result for each test case.**
