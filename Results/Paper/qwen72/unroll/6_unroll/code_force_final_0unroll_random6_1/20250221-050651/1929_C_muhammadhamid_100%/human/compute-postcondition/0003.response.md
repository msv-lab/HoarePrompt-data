Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` from input. It then calculates a value `s` based on `k` and `x` and prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each test case remain unchanged. **
