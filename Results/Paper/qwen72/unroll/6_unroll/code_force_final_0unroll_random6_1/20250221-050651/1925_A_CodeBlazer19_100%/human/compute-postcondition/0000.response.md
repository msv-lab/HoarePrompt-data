The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` now holds the integer value input by the user. The initial state information about `n` and `k` being positive integers with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 remains unchanged as the code snippet does not modify these variables.
Output State: **The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and k, with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. `t` is an input integer.**
