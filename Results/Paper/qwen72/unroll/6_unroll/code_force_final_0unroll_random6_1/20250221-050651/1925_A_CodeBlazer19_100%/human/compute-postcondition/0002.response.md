Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has taken two integers `n` and `k` from the input, and printed a string consisting of the first `k` letters of the alphabet repeated `n` times. The values of `n` and `k` are not retained after each iteration, and `t` remains unchanged.**
