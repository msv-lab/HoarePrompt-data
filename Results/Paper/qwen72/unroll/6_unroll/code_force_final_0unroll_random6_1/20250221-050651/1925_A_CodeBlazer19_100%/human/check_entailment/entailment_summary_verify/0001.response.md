Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. The string `s` should be as short as possible. If there are multiple such strings, any one of them can be printed.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then prints a string that consists of the first `k` letters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.

3. **Evaluating the Solution**:
   - **Case 1: \( n = 1 \)**:
     - If \( n = 1 \), the possible strings are just the individual letters from the first `k` letters of the alphabet.
     - The solution generates a string of length `k` which contains all these letters exactly once.
     - This is correct because each letter is a subsequence of the string.
   - **Case 2: \( n > 1 \)**:
     - The solution generates a string of length `k * n` by repeating the first `k` letters `n` times.
     - This string will indeed contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters.
     - However, the string is not necessarily the shortest possible string that contains all these subsequences.
     - For example, for \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the solution generates "abab", but "baab" is also a valid and shorter string that contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using 'a' and 'b'.
     - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), the solution generates "abcabc", but "abcbac" is also a valid and shorter string that contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

4. **Optimality**:
   - The solution does not always generate the shortest possible string.
   - The problem statement allows for any string that meets the criteria, but it specifically asks for the shortest possible string.
   - The solution provided does not guarantee the shortest string, as demonstrated by the examples above.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The solution is correct in the sense that it generates a string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters.
   - However, it does not always generate the shortest possible string, which is a requirement of the problem.

Final: **False**
