#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct. The function should output the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string to stdout.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive. The function `func` has read `t` distinct strings of length 5 from stdin, and for each string, it has counted the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. The loop has completed all iterations, and the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string has been output to stdout. The variables `ac` and `bc` are reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, so their final values are 0.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive. The function `func` has read `t` distinct strings of length 5 from stdin, and for each string, it has counted the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. The loop has completed all iterations, and the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string has been output to stdout. The variables `ac` and `bc` are reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, so their final values are 0. For the last string processed, if the number of 'A' characters (`ac`) is greater than the number of 'B' characters (`bc`), then 'A' is the most frequent character and has been output to stdout. Otherwise, 'B' is the most frequent character or both 'A' and 'B' are equally frequent, and 'B' has been output to stdout.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a number of test cases `t` from standard input, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 32. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a string of length 5 containing only the characters 'A' and 'B'. The function then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and outputs the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string to standard output. If the number of 'A' and 'B' characters is equal in a string, the function outputs 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function has no further effect on the program state.
