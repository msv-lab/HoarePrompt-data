Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not print the result for each test case. Instead, it only prints the result for the last test case after the loop has completed. To fix this, the `if ac > bc` block should be indented to be inside the for loop that iterates over each test case. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly output the most frequent character for each test case.
