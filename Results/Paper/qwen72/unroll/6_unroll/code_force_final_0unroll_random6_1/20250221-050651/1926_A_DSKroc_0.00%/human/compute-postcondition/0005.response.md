Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive. The function `func` has read `t` distinct strings of length 5 from stdin, and for each string, it has counted the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. The loop has completed all iterations, and the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string has been output to stdout. The variables `ac` and `bc` are reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, so their final values are 0. Additionally, for the last string processed, the number of 'A' characters (`ac`) is less than or equal to the number of 'B' characters (`bc`).**
