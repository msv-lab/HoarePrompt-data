The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct. The function should output the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string to stdout.
