The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which we can consider as `t` (the total number of test cases). For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` must start at 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- The function is designed to handle multiple test cases.
- Each test case involves a single integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation.
- The total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
- The sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 10^5.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `t` is a positive integer and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `i` is 0**
