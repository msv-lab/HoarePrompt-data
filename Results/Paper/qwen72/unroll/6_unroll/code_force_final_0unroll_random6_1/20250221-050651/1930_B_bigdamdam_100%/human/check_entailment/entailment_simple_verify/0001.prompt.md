You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation. The total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and the sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: The function will have processed all test cases, and for each test case, it will have generated and printed a permutation of length n, where the permutation alternates between the largest and smallest remaining numbers, starting with the largest. The variables `i` and `ind` will have their final values after the last iteration of the loop, but these values are not significant as they are local to the loop. The total number of test cases `t` will remain unchanged, and the sum of all `n` values across test cases will also remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and initializes a list \( p \) of length \( n \) with zeros.
   - It then fills the list \( p \) with values in a specific pattern:
     - First, it fills the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) with the largest odd numbers in descending order.
     - Then, it fills the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order.
   - Finally, it prints the permutation \( p \).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Permutation Validity**:
     - The program ensures that all numbers from 1 to \( n \) are used exactly once, which is a requirement for a permutation.
   - **Condition Check**:
     - The program fills the even indices with the largest odd numbers and the odd indices with the smallest odd numbers. This ensures that the numbers at even indices are generally larger than those at odd indices.
     - For any \( i \) and \( j \) where \( i \) and \( j \) are even indices, \( p_i \) and \( p_j \) are large odd numbers, and \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_{j+1} \) are small odd numbers. Since large odd numbers do not divide small odd numbers, the condition \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) is not satisfied.
     - Similarly, for any \( i \) and \( j \) where \( i \) and \( j \) are odd indices, \( p_i \) and \( p_j \) are small odd numbers, and \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_{j+1} \) are large odd numbers. Again, since small odd numbers do not divide large odd numbers, the condition is not satisfied.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - For \( n = 3 \), the permutation [1, 2, 3] is valid, and the program will output this correctly.
     - For \( n = 4 \), the permutation [4, 1, 2, 3] is valid, and the program will output this correctly.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly generates a permutation that meets the problem's requirements for all valid inputs.
