The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `l`. It then finds the two smallest distinct elements in `l` and counts how many elements in `l` are greater than these two smallest elements. The function prints this count for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
