The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and each inner list in `cases` contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The constraints are as follows: `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`, and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2·10^5`.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is based on the input `n` and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `cases`, where each inner list contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case, based on the values of `n` and `a`.**
