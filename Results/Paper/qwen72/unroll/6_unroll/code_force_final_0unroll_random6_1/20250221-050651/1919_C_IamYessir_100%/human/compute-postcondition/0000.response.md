The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the range must have at least one value, meaning `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This input corresponds to the total number of test cases `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value for `t` is at least 1, and the loop variable `_` is set to 0 (the starting point of the loop).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
