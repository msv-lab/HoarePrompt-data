Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It distributes the integers between two lists, `a` and `b`, based on specific conditions. After processing, it calculates the total number of increasing pairs in both lists and prints this number for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After all test cases are processed, the function will have printed the total number of increasing pairs for each test case, and the lists `a` and `b` will be reset for the next test case. **
