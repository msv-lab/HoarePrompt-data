### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `lit` of `n` integers.

2. **Subsequence Splitting:**
   - The function initializes two empty lists `a` and `b` to store the subsequences.
   - It iterates through the list `lit` and decides whether to append each element to `a` or `b` based on the conditions:
     - If `a` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')` (a very large number).
     - If `b` is empty, `y` is set to `float('inf')` (a very large number).
     - The conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` are:
       - If `x > y` and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, append to `b`.
       - If `x > y` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, append to `b`.
       - If `x > y` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to `x`, append to `a`.
       - If `x == y`, append to `a`.
       - If `x < y` and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, append to `a`.
       - If `x < y` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, append to `a`.
       - If `x < y` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x` but less than or equal to `y`, append to `b`.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - After splitting the list, the function calculates the penalty for each subsequence by counting the number of increasing pairs in `a` and `b`.
   - It initializes `s` to 0 and increments `s` for each increasing pair in `a` and `b`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total penalty `s` for each test case.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- The conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` are designed to minimize the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences.
- However, the conditions are overly complex and may not always result in the optimal split. For example, the conditions `x > y` and `x < y` are not necessary for the optimal solution. The optimal solution can be achieved by simply appending elements to `a` or `b` in a way that minimizes the number of increasing pairs.

### Simplified Approach:
- A simpler and more optimal approach would be to append elements to `a` or `b` in such a way that the subsequences are as non-increasing as possible. This can be achieved by always appending the current element to the subsequence that ends with the largest element that is less than or equal to the current element.

### Conclusion:
- The given program does not always produce the correct minimum penalty for all test cases due to the overly complex and potentially suboptimal conditions for appending elements to `a` and `b`.
