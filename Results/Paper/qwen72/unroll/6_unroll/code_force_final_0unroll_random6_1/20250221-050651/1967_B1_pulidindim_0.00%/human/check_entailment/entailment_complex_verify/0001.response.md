### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = k
     \]
     \[
     \frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} + \frac{b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = k
     \]
     \[
     \frac{a}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} + \frac{1}{\gcd(a, b)} = k
     \]
   - Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
   - The condition becomes:
     \[
     \frac{d \cdot a' + d \cdot b'}{d \cdot b' \cdot d} = k
     \]
     \[
     \frac{a' + b'}{b' \cdot d} = k
     \]
   - This implies \(a' + b'\) must be a multiple of \(b' \cdot d\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program initializes the count of valid pairs to \(n\) (which is the number of pairs \((a, 1)\) for \(1 \le a \le n\)).
   - It then iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The program uses a variable `countmins` which is \(b - 1\).
   - It calculates \(g = n / b\) and checks if \(g < countmins\). If true, it breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates the answer by adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{g - countmins}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the base case where \(b = 1\), which always results in \(a + 1\) being a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1)\) (since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\)).
   - However, the logic for calculating the number of valid \(a\) values for \(b > 1\) is flawed.
   - The calculation of \(g\) and the subsequent update to `ans` does not accurately reflect the number of valid pairs.
   - Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not correctly checked in the loop. The program should be checking if \((a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\) for each \(a\) and \(b\), but it does not do this.
   - The update to `ans` using \(\left\lfloor \frac{g - countmins}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\) is not derived from a correct mathematical insight and does not count the valid pairs correctly.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem statement.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
