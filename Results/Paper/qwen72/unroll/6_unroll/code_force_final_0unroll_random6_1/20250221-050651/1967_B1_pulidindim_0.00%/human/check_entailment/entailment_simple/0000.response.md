### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Loop for Test Cases:**
   - The function `func` starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `m` for each case.

2. **Initialization of `count` and `ans`:**
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
   - The variable `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `g` is updated by subtracting `countmins` from it.
   - The value of `ans` is incremented by `g / count + 1`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints the integer value of `ans` for the current test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Condition for Valid Pairs:**
  - The problem requires finding ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  - The given solution initializes `ans` to `n`, which implies that all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid since \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).

- **Loop Logic:**
  - The loop iterates over `count` starting from 2 up to `m`.
  - For each `count`, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
  - It then calculates `g` as `n / count`.
  - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks, which is a valid condition to stop the loop if no more valid pairs can be found.
  - Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` and adds \((g / count + 1)\) to `ans`.
  - The loop increments `count` by 1.

### Issues with the Logic:

- **Incorrect Calculation of `g`:**
  - The variable `g` is calculated as `n / count`, which is not the correct way to determine the number of valid pairs. The correct approach should involve the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`.
  - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not correctly implemented in the loop.

- **Incorrect Increment of `ans`:**
  - The increment `ans += g / count + 1` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs. It seems to be an attempt to count pairs, but it does not follow the problem's constraints and conditions.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem. The initialization and loop logic are flawed, and the conditions for valid pairs are not correctly checked.

### Correctness:
**False**
