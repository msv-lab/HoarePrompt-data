The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers with the constraints 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^4. It is guaranteed that the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6. The function returns a result based on the inputs `n` and `m` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` for each of up to 10^4 test cases, with the constraints 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and returns a result based on the inputs `n` and `m` for each test case.**
