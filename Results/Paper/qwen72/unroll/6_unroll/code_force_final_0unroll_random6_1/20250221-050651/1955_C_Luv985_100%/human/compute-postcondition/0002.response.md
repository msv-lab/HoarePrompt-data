The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 10^4. Since `T` is already within a range that ensures it is non-zero, no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^{15}, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9**
