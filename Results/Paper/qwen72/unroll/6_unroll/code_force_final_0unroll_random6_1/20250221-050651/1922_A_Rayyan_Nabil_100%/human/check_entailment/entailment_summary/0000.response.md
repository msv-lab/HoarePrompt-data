Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The conditions for matching the template are:
1. If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then `s_i` must be the same as `t_i`.
2. If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then `s_i` must be different from the lowercase version of `t_i`.

The function `func_1` checks if there is at least one index `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index is found, it returns 'YES'. If no such index exists, it returns 'NO'.

However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the template conditions properly. Specifically, it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. The function only checks if `a` and `b` are different from `c` at any position, which is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure:
- For each position `i`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template must have that lowercase letter at position `i`.
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template can have any uppercase letter that is not the lowercase version of `c[i]`.

The function `func_1` does not implement these conditions, and thus it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
