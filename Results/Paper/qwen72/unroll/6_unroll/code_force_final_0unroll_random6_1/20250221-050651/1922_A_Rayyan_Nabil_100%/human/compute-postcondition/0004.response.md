The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration. 

For the loop to execute, `results` must have at least one element. Since `t` is at least 1, `results` will have at least one element. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` or the conditions that ensure `results` is populated. However, for the first iteration, `result` needs to be the first element in the `results` list.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `result` is the first element in the `results` list**
