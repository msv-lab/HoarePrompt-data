### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
     - The strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
     - The string `c` does not match the template `t`.
   - The template `t` is a string of length `n` where:
     - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be equal to `t[i]`.
     - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` as input.
     - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
     - It checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
     - If this condition is true for any position `i`, it returns 'YES'.
     - If the loop completes without finding such a position, it returns 'NO'.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
     - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to a list `results`.
     - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The logic in `func_1` is **incomplete**. The function checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, but this alone does not ensure that a valid template `t` can be constructed.
     - To construct a valid template, we need to ensure that for each position `i`:
       - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be equal to `t[i]`.
       - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.
     - The current implementation does not check if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, which is necessary for a valid template.
     - Additionally, it does not handle the case where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same but different from `c[i]`, which would still allow a valid template to be constructed.

4. **Correcting the Logic:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that:
     - For each position `i`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` and `b[i]` to allow a valid template.
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, then we can always construct a template where `t[i]` is uppercase and different from the lowercase version of `c[i]`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does handle the edge case where `n` is 1.
   - However, it fails to handle cases where `a` and `b` are the same at some positions and `c` is different from both, which should be a 'YES' case but might be incorrectly identified as 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is **incorrect** because it does not fully implement the logic required to determine the existence of a valid template `t` that matches the conditions for `a` and `b` while not matching `c`.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
