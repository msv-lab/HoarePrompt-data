### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
     - The strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
     - The string `c` does not match the template `t`.
   - The template `t` is a string of length `n` where:
     - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be equal to `t[i]`.
     - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` as input.
     - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
     - It checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
     - If this condition is true for any position `i`, it returns 'YES'.
     - If the loop completes without finding such a position, it returns 'NO'.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
     - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to a list `results`.
     - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The logic in `func_1` is not entirely correct. The function only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` at any position `i`. However, this does not guarantee that a valid template `t` can be constructed.
     - For a valid template `t` to exist, we need to ensure that:
       - For each position `i`, if `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (and hence `b[i]`).
       - If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

     - The current implementation of `func_1` only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, which is insufficient. It does not handle the case where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same but `c[i]` is also the same, which should return 'NO'.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - The function correctly handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the inputs and calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - It stores the results and prints them after processing all test cases.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the edge case where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same but `c[i]` is also the same, which should return 'NO'.
   - For example, if `a = "a"`, `b = "a"`, and `c = "a"`, the current implementation will return 'NO' correctly, but if `a = "a"`, `b = "a"`, and `c = "b"`, it will return 'YES' incorrectly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because the logic in `func_1` does not fully capture the conditions required to determine if a valid template `t` exists.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
