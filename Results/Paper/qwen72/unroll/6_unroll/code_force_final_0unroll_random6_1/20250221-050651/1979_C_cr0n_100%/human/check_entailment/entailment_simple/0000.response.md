### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, you receive back \(k_i \times x_i\) coins, where \(x_i\) is the amount of coins bet on outcome \(i\).
   - The total amount of coins bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the multipliers \(k_i\) for each outcome.
   - It then calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers \(k_i\) and uses this LCM to determine the bets \(x_i\).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The LCM is used to ensure that the bets \(x_i\) are such that the total bet is a multiple of the LCM of the multipliers.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier \(k_1\).
   - It iterates over all multipliers and updates `den` to be the LCM of all multipliers.
   - It then calculates the bets \(x_i\) as \(\frac{\text{den}}{k_i}\).
   - The total bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The program checks if the total bet is less than `den`. If not, it prints \(-1\) indicating no solution.
   - If the total bet is less than `den`, it prints the bets \(x_i\).

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets \(x_i\) are such that the total bet is a multiple of the LCM.
   - The condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \text{den}\) is checked to ensure that the total bet is less than the LCM.
   - If the condition is satisfied, the bets \(x_i\) are printed, and the program is correct.
   - If the condition is not satisfied, the program prints \(-1\), which is the correct output for cases where no solution exists.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The state comment in `func_2` mentions that `den` is the GCD of all integers in `vals`, which is incorrect. `den` is actually the LCM of all integers in `vals`.
   - However, this does not affect the correctness of the program as the LCM is correctly calculated and used.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation. It correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and uses it to determine the bets \(x_i\). The condition check ensures that the total bet is less than the LCM, and the program handles cases where no solution exists by printing \(-1\).

Correctness: **True**
