The code snippet `vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `vals`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50.
- `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 ≤ `vals[i]` ≤ 20 for all 0 ≤ i < N.

After executing the code:
- `vals` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- The length of `vals` is still `N`, and each element of `vals` is an integer between 2 and 20, inclusive.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of N integers read from the input, where each integer is between 2 and 20, inclusive.**
