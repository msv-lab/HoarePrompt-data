Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`. This is a correct implementation of the LCM.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function handles the logic for each test case.
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier.
   - It iterates through the multipliers and updates `den` to be the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier. This ensures that `den` is the LCM of all the multipliers.
   - It calculates the bets for each outcome as `den // r` where `r` is the multiplier for that outcome.
   - It checks if the total sum of the bets is less than `den`. If not, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution.
   - If a valid distribution is found, it prints the bets.

The logic ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, which is the requirement of the problem. The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the solution is valid for the given problem description.
