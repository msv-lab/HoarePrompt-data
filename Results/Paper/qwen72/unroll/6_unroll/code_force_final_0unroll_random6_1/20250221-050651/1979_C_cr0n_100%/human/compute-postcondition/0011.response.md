Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `den` is a variable that is updated to `den - sum(vprod)`.
2. `vals` is a list that remains unchanged.
3. `N` is a variable that remains unchanged.
4. `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `den` (before the update) divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
5. `den` is greater than 0 after the update.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `vprod`**:
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is `den` (before the update) divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - Let's denote the initial value of `den` as `den_initial`.
   - Therefore, `vprod[i] = den_initial / vals[i]` for each index `i` in `vals`.

2. **Update `den`**:
   - After calculating `vprod`, `den` is updated to `den_initial - sum(vprod)`.
   - Since `den` is greater than 0 after the update, `den_initial - sum(vprod) > 0`.

3. **Print `vprod`**:
   - The code snippet `print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))` will print the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.
   - Each element in `vprod` is `den_initial / vals[i]`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. Each element in `vprod` is the result of `den_initial` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.

Since the exact values of `den_initial` and `vals` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **`den_initial / vals[0] den_initial / vals[1] ... den_initial / vals[N-1]` (where `den_initial` is the initial value of `den` and `vals` is the list of values)**
