### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a chessboard of size `n x n` where you and the computer take turns placing rooks.
   - Each move you make is mirrored by the computer, except when the move is on the diagonal (i.e., `r = c`), in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and updates `n` based on whether the move is on the diagonal or not.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations and prints the result.

3. **Function `func_1` Summary**:
   - `func_1` computes the number of possible final configurations for a given `n` using dynamic programming.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]`.
   - The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the DP array using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - The function returns `dp[-1]`, which is the last computed value.

4. **Edge Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `n = 1` and `k = 0`**:
     - According to the problem, if `n` is 1 and `k` is 0, there should be exactly one final configuration possible, which is an empty board.
     - The program will call `func_1(1)`.
     - Inside `func_1`, the DP array is initialized with `[1, 1]`.
     - Since the loop starts from 2, it does not run for `n = 1`.
     - The function returns `dp[-1]`, which is 1.
     - This is the correct output for the edge case `n = 1` and `k = 0`.

5. **General Case Analysis**:
   - For `n > 1`, the program correctly updates `n` based on the initial moves.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle larger values of `n` and correctly computes the number of possible final configurations using the given formula.
   - The formula and the DP array initialization are consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect. The program does handle the edge case `n = 1` and `k = 0` correctly, returning 1 as expected. The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is also correctly implemented for larger values of `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
