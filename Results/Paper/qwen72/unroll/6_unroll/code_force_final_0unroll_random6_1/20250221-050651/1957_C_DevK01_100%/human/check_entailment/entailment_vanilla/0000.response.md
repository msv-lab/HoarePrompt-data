### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
   - You and the computer take turns to place rooks.
   - You place a white rook, and the computer mirrors your move by placing a black rook at the mirrored position \((c, r)\).
   - If \( r = c \), the computer skips its turn.
   - We need to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), the size of the chessboard and the number of initial moves.
   - It then reads \( k \) moves, each consisting of \( r_i \) and \( c_i \).

3. **Initial Moves and Board State:**
   - For each initial move, the program checks if \( r_i \neq c_i \). If true, it reduces \( n \) by 2 because both the row and column are blocked by the rooks.
   - If \( r_i = c_i \), it reduces \( n \) by 1 because only one row (or column) is blocked.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to calculate the number of different final configurations.
   - The dynamic programming (DP) approach is used to solve this problem.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]` to handle the base cases.
   - The DP transition is defined as:
     \[
     dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]
     \]
     This transition accounts for:
     - Placing a rook in a new row and column, which can be done in \( dp[i-1] \) ways.
     - Placing a rook in a new row and column, and then placing another rook in the remaining \( i-2 \) rows and columns, which can be done in \( 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2] \) ways (since there are \( 2 \cdot (i-1) \) ways to choose the positions).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of different final configurations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Correctness:
- The program correctly parses the input and processes the initial moves.
- The DP approach used in `func_1(n)` is correct for calculating the number of different final configurations.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
