### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the number of remaining valid positions on the board.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - If `a != b`, it means the computer will place a rook at `(b, a)`, which is a different position. Therefore, both positions `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 2.
   - If `a == b`, the computer skips its turn, and only one position `(a, a)` is occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 1.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to compute the number of possible final configurations for the remaining `n` positions.
   - The dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is initialized with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`, representing the base cases where there are 1 way to place 0 rooks and 1 way to place 1 rook.
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the DP array is updated using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place `i` rooks on an `i x i` board:
     - `dp[i-1]` represents the number of ways to place `i-1` rooks and leave one row and one column free.
     - `2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` represents the number of ways to place the `i`-th rook in one of the `i-1` free rows and columns, and then place the remaining `i-2` rooks in the remaining `i-2` rows and columns.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
  - It reads the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k` for each test case.
  - It reads the `k` moves and processes them to update the number of available positions.

- **Move Processing:**
  - The program correctly reduces the number of available positions based on whether the move is mirrored or not.

- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - The DP formula used in `func_1(n)` is correct for counting the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a board.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow and is within the required range.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
