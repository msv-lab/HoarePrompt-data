### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the remaining valid positions for rooks.

2. **Processing Moves**:
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - If `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2 because both the player and the computer place rooks on different positions.
   - If `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1 because the player and the computer place rooks on the same position, and the computer skips its turn.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The dynamic programming list `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]` which represents the base cases:
     - `dp[0]` is 1 because there is exactly one way to place 0 rooks on a board.
     - `dp[1]` is 1 because there is exactly one way to place 1 rook on a board.
   - The loop iterates from 2 to `n` and updates the `dp` list using the formula:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`
   - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place `i` rooks on a board where no two rooks attack each other. The term `2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` represents the number of ways to place the `i`-th rook in a new row and column, considering the previous configurations.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case.
   - The `dp` list is maintained with the last two values, which is efficient for large `n`.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the number of possible final configurations of rooks on the chessboard. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for this problem, and the state transitions are correctly handled. The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
