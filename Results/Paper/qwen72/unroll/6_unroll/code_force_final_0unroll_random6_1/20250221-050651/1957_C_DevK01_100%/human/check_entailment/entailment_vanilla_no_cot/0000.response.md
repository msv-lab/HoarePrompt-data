Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made. It then reads the `k` moves and processes them.

2. **Move Processing**: For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if the move is on the diagonal (`a == b`). If it is, it reduces `n` by 1 (since only one rook is placed). If it is not, it reduces `n` by 2 (since both a white rook and a black rook are placed).

3. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations**: The function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming. The recurrence relation used is:
   \[
   dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]
   \]
   This relation is correct because:
   - `dp[i-1]` accounts for the configurations where the last rook is placed on the diagonal.
   - `2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` accounts for the configurations where the last rook is placed off the diagonal, and there are `2 * (i-1)` ways to place the last rook (since it can be placed in any of the `i-1` rows and columns, and there are two colors).

4. **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given this, the program should correctly compute the number of different final configurations for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
