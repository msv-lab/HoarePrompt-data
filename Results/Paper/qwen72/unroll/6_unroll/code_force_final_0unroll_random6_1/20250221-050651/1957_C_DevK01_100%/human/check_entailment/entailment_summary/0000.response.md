Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations possible on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) initial moves, where the computer mirrors the player's moves. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) (the size of the chessboard) and \( k \) (the number of initial moves).
   - It then reads \( k \) moves, each consisting of two integers \( r_i \) and \( c_i \).

2. **Initial Moves Processing**:
   - For each initial move, the program checks if \( r_i \) is not equal to \( c_i \). If they are different, it reduces \( n \) by 2 because both the player's and the computer's moves occupy a row and a column, making them unavailable for future moves.
   - If \( r_i \) equals \( c_i \), it reduces \( n \) by 1 because the computer skips its turn, and only one row and one column are occupied.

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to compute the number of possible final configurations.
   - It uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining \( n \times n \) board.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with the base cases `[1, 1]`, representing the number of configurations for \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \).
   - For each \( i \) from 2 to \( n \), it updates the DP array using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size \( i \times i \) by considering the configurations of smaller boards.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the result of `func_1(n)`.

**Verification**:
- The program correctly processes the initial moves and updates the board size \( n \) based on the given rules.
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is appropriate for calculating the number of configurations, as it considers the constraints of the problem (no two rooks can share the same row or column).
- The use of a rolling array to store only the last two values of the DP array is an efficient way to manage memory, especially for large \( n \).

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and produce the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
