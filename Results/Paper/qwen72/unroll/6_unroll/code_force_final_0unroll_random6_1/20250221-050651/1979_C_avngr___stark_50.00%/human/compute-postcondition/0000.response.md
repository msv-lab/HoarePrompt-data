Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. `k` is a list of n integers representing the multipliers for each outcome, where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. `hcf` is assigned the value of `k[0]`.** 

In natural language: The variable `hcf` is now assigned the value of the first element in the list `k`. The values of `n` and the list `k` remain unchanged.
