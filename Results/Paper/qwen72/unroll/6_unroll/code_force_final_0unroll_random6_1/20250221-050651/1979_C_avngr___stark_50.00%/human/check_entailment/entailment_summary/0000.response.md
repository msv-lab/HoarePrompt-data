### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - We need to ensure that `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k` for each outcome.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `m`.
   - It then calculates the bets `c` for each outcome as `m / k_i`.
   - It finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all bets using the `func_1` function.
   - It normalizes the bets by dividing each bet by the GCD.
   - If the sum of the normalized bets is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the normalized bets.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **GCD Calculation:** The `func_1` function correctly calculates the GCD of a list of numbers.
   - **Bet Calculation:** The program calculates the bets as `m / k_i`, which ensures that the product of the bets and the multipliers is the same for all outcomes.
   - **Normalization:** The program normalizes the bets by dividing each by the GCD, which is a valid step to ensure the bets are integers.
   - **Sum Check:** The program checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than `m / hcf`. This is a crucial step to ensure the condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i` is met.
   - **Output:** The program prints the normalized bets if the condition is met, otherwise it prints `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Outcome:** If there is only one outcome, the program should print `-1` because the total bet cannot be less than the amount received back.
   - **Equal Multipliers:** If all multipliers are the same, the program should print `-1` because the total bet will always be equal to the amount received back.
   - **Large Multipliers:** The program should handle large multipliers and large sums correctly, which it does by using the GCD to normalize the bets.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the first test case with `k = [3, 2, 7]`:
     - `m = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
     - `c = [42 / 3, 42 / 2, 42 / 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
     - `hcf = gcd(14, 21, 6) = 1`
     - Normalized bets: `[14, 21, 6]`
     - Sum of bets: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
     - Condition: `41 < 42 / 1` (True)
     - Output: `14 21 6` (Correct, but the program outputs `27 41 12` which is also correct as it satisfies the condition).

   - For the second test case with `k = [3, 3]`:
     - `m = 3 * 3 = 9`
     - `c = [9 / 3, 9 / 3] = [3, 3]`
     - `hcf = gcd(3, 3) = 3`
     - Normalized bets: `[1, 1]`
     - Sum of bets: `1 + 1 = 2`
     - Condition: `2 < 9 / 3` (True)
     - Output: `1 1` (Correct).

   - For the third test case with `k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`:
     - `m = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 3125`
     - `c = [3125 / 5, 3125 / 5, 3125 / 5, 3125 / 5, 3125 / 5] = [625, 625, 625, 625, 625]`
     - `hcf = gcd(625, 625, 625, 625, 625) = 625`
     - Normalized bets: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
     - Sum of bets: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`
     - Condition: `5 >= 3125 / 625` (False)
     - Output: `-1` (Correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and checks the condition to ensure a valid distribution. It handles edge cases and multiple test cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
