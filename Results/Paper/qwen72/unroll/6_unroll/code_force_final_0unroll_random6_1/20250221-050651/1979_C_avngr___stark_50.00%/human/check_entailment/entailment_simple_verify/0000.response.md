### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the original assessment to understand if the program is correct or not.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - If all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same, it is impossible to satisfy this condition because the total amount bet will always be equal to the amount received back for any winning outcome.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers \( k_i \) and stores it in \( m \).
   - It then calculates the list \( c \) where each element \( c_i \) is \( \frac{m}{k_i} \).
   - The program finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in \( c \) and divides each element by this GCD to reduce the values.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the reduced values in \( c \) is less than \( \frac{m}{\text{GCD}} \). If it is, it prints the reduced values; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Key Points in the Annotated Code**:
   - **State before function call**: \( n \) and \( k \) are correctly defined and within the specified constraints.
   - **State after function call**: The GCD of the list \( c \) is correctly calculated and returned.

4. **Evaluation of the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same.
   - Let's consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     5 5 5 5 5
     ```
   - The program calculates \( m \) as \( 5^5 = 3125 \).
   - The list \( c \) is calculated as \( [625, 625, 625, 625, 625] \).
   - The GCD of \( c \) is \( 625 \).
   - The reduced list \( c \) becomes \( [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \).
   - The sum of the reduced list is \( 5 \), and \( \frac{m}{\text{GCD}} = \frac{3125}{625} = 5 \).
   - The program correctly identifies that the sum of the reduced list is not strictly less than \( \frac{m}{\text{GCD}} \) and prints \(-1\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does correctly handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. It prints \(-1\) as expected.
   - The original assessment is incorrect because it claims the program does not handle this case, but the program does.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
