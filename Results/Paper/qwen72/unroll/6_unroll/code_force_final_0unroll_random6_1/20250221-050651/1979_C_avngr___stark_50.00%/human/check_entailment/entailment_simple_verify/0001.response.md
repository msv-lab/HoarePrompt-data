### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to distribute coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, you receive \(k_i \times x_i\) coins, where \(x_i\) is the amount bet on that outcome.
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers \(k_i\) and stores it in \(m\).
   - It then calculates the bet for each outcome as \(c_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\).
   - The program finds the highest common factor (HCF) of all \(c_i\) values and divides each \(c_i\) by this HCF to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the reduced bets is strictly less than \(\frac{m}{\text{HCF}}\). If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The product \(m\) of all \(k_i\) values ensures that each \(c_i\) is a multiple of the other \(c_j\) values, which helps in finding a common solution.
   - Dividing each \(c_i\) by the HCF reduces the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same relative proportions.
   - The condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i < \frac{m}{\text{HCF}}\) ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all \(k_i\) values are the same, the program correctly identifies that there is no way to distribute the coins to satisfy the condition (since \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i\) would be equal to \(\frac{m}{\text{HCF}}\)).
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating over the number of test cases and processing each one independently.

5. **Implementation Details:**
   - The use of the `gcd` function from the `math` module is correct for finding the highest common factor.
   - The program correctly calculates the product \(m\) and the bets \(c_i\).
   - The HCF is calculated using a helper function `func_1`, which iterates over the list of \(c_i\) values and updates the HCF accordingly.

6. **Verification Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the state of the program is correctly maintained at key points.
   - The HCF is correctly calculated and used to reduce the bets.
   - The final condition check \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i < \frac{m}{\text{HCF}}\) is valid and ensures the correctness of the solution.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and checks the condition to ensure the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. It handles edge cases and multiple test cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
