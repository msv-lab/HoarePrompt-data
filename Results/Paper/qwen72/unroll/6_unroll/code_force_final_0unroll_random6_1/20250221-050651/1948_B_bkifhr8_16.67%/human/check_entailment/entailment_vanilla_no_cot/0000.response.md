Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it attempts to solve the problem. Specifically, the program only checks and modifies the array once, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Single Pass Modification**:
   - The program only performs a single pass through the array, checking if any element is out of order and greater than 10. If it finds such an element, it splits it into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - This single pass is not enough to ensure that the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation. For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. After the first pass, it might become `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, but the array is still not sorted, and the program will incorrectly output `No`.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. However, this function is called after only one pass of the array, which might not be sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by the given operation.

3. **Missing Iterative Approach**:
   - The problem requires an iterative approach to repeatedly apply the operation until the array is sorted or it is determined that sorting is impossible. The program does not implement this iterative approach.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to repeatedly apply the operation and check if the array can be sorted. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    while True:
        # Check if the array is already sorted
        if a == sorted(a):
            return True
        
        # Flag to check if any change was made in this iteration
        changed = False
        
        # Iterate through the array and apply the operation
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] >= 10:
                # Split the number into its digits
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(a[i])]
                # Remove the original number
                a.pop(i)
                # Insert the digits back into the array
                for digit in reversed(digits):
                    a.insert(i, digit)
                changed = True
                break
        
        # If no changes were made in this iteration, the array cannot be sorted
        if not changed:
            return False

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`can_be_sorted` Function**:
  - This function repeatedly applies the operation to the array until it is sorted or no more changes can be made.
  - It checks if the array is already sorted. If it is, it returns `True`.
  - If the array is not sorted, it looks for any element that is at least 10, splits it into its digits, and inserts the digits back into the array.
  - If no changes are made in an iteration, it returns `False`, indicating that the array cannot be sorted by the given operation.

- **Main Program**:
  - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads the array and calls the `can_be_sorted` function to determine if the array can be sorted.
  - It prints `Yes` if the array can be sorted, and `No` otherwise.

This corrected approach ensures that the program correctly determines whether the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation.
