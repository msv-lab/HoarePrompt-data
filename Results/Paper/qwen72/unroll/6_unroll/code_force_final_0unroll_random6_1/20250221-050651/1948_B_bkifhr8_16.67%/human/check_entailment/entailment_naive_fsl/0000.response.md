Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only attempts to split elements that are greater than the next element and are greater than 10. However, the problem description requires that the array can be made sorted in non-decreasing order using the operation any number of times, and the program does not ensure that the array is fully sorted after performing the operations.

Here is a test case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Yes
No
Yes
```

**Why it fails:**
- For the second test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will only split the first element `12` into `[1, 2, 28, 5]` because `12` is greater than `5`. However, the array is still not sorted, and the program will incorrectly output `No` even though it is possible to make the array sorted by splitting `28` into `[2, 8]` and then the array becomes `[1, 2, 5, 2, 8]`, which can be sorted by rearranging the elements.

The program should consider all possible splits and check if the array can be made sorted after performing the operations. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results for some cases.
