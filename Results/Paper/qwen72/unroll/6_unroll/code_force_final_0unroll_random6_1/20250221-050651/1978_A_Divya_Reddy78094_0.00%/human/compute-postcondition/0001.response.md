The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of the list `a` and the integer `n` are not involved in the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
