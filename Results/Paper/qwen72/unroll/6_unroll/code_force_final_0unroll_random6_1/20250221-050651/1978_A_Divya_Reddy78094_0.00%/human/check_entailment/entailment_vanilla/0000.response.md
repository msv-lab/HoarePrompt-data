### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums` for each book.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of pages `nums` in descending order using `nums.sort(reverse=True)`. This ensures that the books with the most pages are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Sum of Top Two Pages**:
   - After sorting, the program prints the sum of the first two elements in the sorted list (`nums[0] + nums[1]`).
   - This approach is correct because the two books with the most pages will always be the best choice for Alice to read, as she reads the book with the highest number of pages from each pile.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the minimum number of books (2) correctly.
   - It also handles the maximum number of books (100) and the maximum number of pages (10^9) within the constraints.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the correct result for each test case, which is the maximum number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
