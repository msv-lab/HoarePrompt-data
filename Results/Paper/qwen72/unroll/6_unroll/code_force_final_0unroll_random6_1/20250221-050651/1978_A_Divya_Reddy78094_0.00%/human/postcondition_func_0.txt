The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of books, and a list of `n` integers `nums` representing the number of pages in each book. It then sorts the list `nums` in descending order and prints the sum of the two largest numbers in `nums`. The function does not return any value. After all test cases are processed, the values of `t`, `n`, and `nums` are undefined or reset for the next iteration, and any other variables not affected by the loop remain unchanged.
