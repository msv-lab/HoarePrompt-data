Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two non-empty piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile. The provided program does the following:

1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Reads the number of books `n`.
   - Reads the list of page counts `nums`.
   - Sorts the list `nums` in descending order.
   - Prints the sum of the two largest numbers in `nums`.

The key insight here is that the two largest numbers in the list `nums` will always be the books with the highest number of pages, regardless of how the books are divided into two piles. Therefore, the sum of these two largest numbers will always be the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

The program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the input as specified.
- It sorts the list in descending order to ensure the two largest numbers are at the beginning.
- It prints the sum of the two largest numbers, which is the correct solution for the problem.

Thus, the program is correct for the given problem description and input constraints.

Correctness: **True**
