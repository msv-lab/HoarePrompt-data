You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Program:
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if n == k:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(1)
        elif n + 2 > k * 2:
            print('YES')
            print(2)
            print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
            print(1)
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then checks if `n` equals `k`, and if so, prints 'YES' followed by two lines, each containing the number 1. If `n` does not equal `k` but `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, it prints 'YES' followed by two lines: the first line contains `n - k + 1`, and the second line contains 1. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not retain the values of `n` and `k` for each test case, and the value of `t` is 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation of the incorrect case:
Consider the input where `n = 10` and `k = 3`. According to the problem description, Bob needs to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 3 jewels. The program should output a valid configuration of stalls and prices. However, the program does not handle this case correctly:

1. The program checks if `n == k`. In this case, `10 != 3`, so it moves to the next condition.
2. The program then checks if `n + 2 > k * 2`. For `n = 10` and `k = 3`, this condition evaluates to `10 + 2 > 3 * 2`, which is `12 > 6`, so it is true.
3. The program prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. For `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the prices are `10 - 3 + 1 = 8` and `1`.

So, the output is:
```
YES
2
8 1
```

However, this configuration does not ensure that Alice buys exactly 3 jewels. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (spending 8 coins) and then buy 2 more jewels from the second stall (spending 2 coins), totaling 3 jewels. But this is not a valid configuration because the prices should be such that Alice buys exactly 3 jewels, and the program does not ensure this for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

A correct configuration for `n = 10` and `k = 3` could be:
```
YES
3
4 3 3
```
In this case:
- Alice buys 2 jewels from the first stall (spending 8 coins).
- Alice buys 1 jewel from the second stall (spending 3 coins).
- Alice has 1 coin left, which is not enough to buy any more jewels.

Thus, Alice buys exactly 3 jewels, which is the correct behavior. The given program does not handle this case correctly, so it is incorrect.
