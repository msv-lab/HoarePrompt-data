### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Conditions for "YES" and "NO":**
   - **Case 1: `n == k`**
     - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is correctly handled by printing 'YES', followed by `1` and `1`.
   - **Case 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**
     - This condition is derived from the fact that if `n + 2 > k * 2`, then `n > 2k - 2`. This means Alice has enough coins to buy `k` jewels by setting up two stalls: one with a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel and another with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This ensures that Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels.
   - **Case 3: `n + 2 <= k * 2`**
     - If `n + 2 <= k * 2`, then `n <= 2k - 2`. In this case, it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels because she would not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels even if she bought 1 jewel from each of the first `k` stalls. This is correctly handled by printing 'NO'.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The function prints the correct output format for each test case: 'YES' or 'NO' followed by the number of stalls and the prices of the stalls if the answer is 'YES'.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases correctly. For example, if `n` is 1 and `k` is 1, it correctly prints 'YES' with one stall priced at 1 coin. If `n` is 1 and `k` is 2, it correctly prints 'NO' because Alice cannot buy 2 jewels with only 1 coin.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines whether Bob can set up the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and prints the appropriate output format. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
