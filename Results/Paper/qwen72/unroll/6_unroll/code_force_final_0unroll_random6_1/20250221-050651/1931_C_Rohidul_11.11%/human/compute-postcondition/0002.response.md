The function `func` seems to be missing the parameters in the provided function signature. Based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here's the organized information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, representing the elements of the list.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but typically, such a function would process the list `a` for each test case and return some result based on the elements of `a` and the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of the list), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It processes the list `a` for each test case and returns a result based on the elements of `a` and the constraints.**
