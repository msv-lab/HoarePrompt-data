The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range(int(input()))` expression. For the loop to execute, the expression `int(input())` must return a positive integer. This means the user input must be a string that can be converted to an integer greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The loop will execute based on the user input, which is expected to be a positive integer. The initial state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, but we need to ensure that the user input is a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the user input is a positive integer.**
