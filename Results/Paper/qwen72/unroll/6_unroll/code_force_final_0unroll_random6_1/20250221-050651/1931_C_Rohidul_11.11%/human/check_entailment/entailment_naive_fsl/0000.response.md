Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has elements that are not equal at the boundaries but can be made equal with a smaller cost than the current logic suggests. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1]`. The correct answer should be `3` (by setting the elements from index 1 to 3 to 1), but the program will output `4` because it incorrectly calculates the cost as `r - l` without considering the optimal subarray to set to a common value.

The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks for consecutive equal elements at the boundaries and does not consider the possibility of finding a common value within the array that can be used to make all elements equal with a lower cost. This leads to incorrect results for certain test cases.
