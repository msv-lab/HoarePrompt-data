You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: The loop processes each test case, and for each test case, it prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated value of `ans`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are reset for each test case, and the final state of these variables is undefined after the loop completes. The variables `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` are only relevant within each test case and are recalculated for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It also initializes two counters `st` and `end` to zero, which will be used to track the length of consecutive segments of the same value at the start and end of the array.

3. **Consecutive Segments at Start and End:**
   - The program uses a while loop to move the pointer `l` to the right as long as the current element `a[l]` is equal to the next element `a[l + 1]`.
   - Similarly, it uses another while loop to move the pointer `r` to the left as long as the current element `a[r]` is equal to the previous element `a[r - 1]`.
   - During these loops, it increments the counters `st` and `end` to keep track of the lengths of these consecutive segments.

4. **Conditions for Minimum Burles:**
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same (`a[0] == a[-1]`), the program calculates the number of burles needed as `r - l - 1`. This is because the segments at the start and end are already the same, and we only need to change the middle segment.
   - If the segments at the start and end are both of length zero and the first and last elements are different (`st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]`), the program calculates the number of burles needed as `len(a) - 1`. This is because we need to change all elements except one to make the array uniform.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the number of burles needed as `r - l`. This is because we need to change the segment between `l` and `r`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated number of burles, ensuring that the output is non-negative.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where the array is already uniform or where the segments at the start and end are already the same.
- The logic for calculating the minimum number of burles is sound and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.
- The program ensures that the output is always non-negative, which is necessary as the minimum number of burles cannot be negative.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.

Correctness: **True**
