You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Output

    Bob

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, where a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be: `def func(t, a, b):`
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the values of `a` and `b` are unchanged for each test case. The output for each test case is 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. The variable `t` has been incremented from 0 to `test - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `test` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'. If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The values of `a` and `b` are unchanged for each test case, and the variable `t` is incremented from 0 to `test - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the condition used to determine the winner. The condition `if a + b & 1 == 0:` is incorrect because the bitwise AND operator `&` has higher precedence than the addition operator `+`. This means that the expression `a + b & 1` is evaluated as `a + (b & 1)`, which is not the intended logic.

The correct condition should be `if (a + b) % 2 == 0:` to check if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This is because the game will always end in a finite number of moves, and the player who starts with an odd total number of coins will always be able to force the game into a state where the opponent cannot make a move.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
1 1
```
The program will incorrectly output:
```
Bob
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
Bob
```
This is a correct output, but the program will fail for other inputs. For example, consider the input:
```
1
2 2
```
The program will incorrectly output:
```
Alice
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
Bob
```
This is because the sum of `2 + 2` is `4`, which is even, and Bob should win. The program's current logic will incorrectly determine the winner due to the precedence issue.
