To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `t` and `test`. The loop will execute if `test` is greater than 0. The variable `t` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- The function should take two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
- The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test` is an input integer.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, `test` must be greater than 0, and `t` will start at 0.

State: **`test` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0**
