You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters, which is a discrepancy.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the integer input initially provided. For each iteration, the input string `s` was split into two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. After all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the values from the last test case. The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: *The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the integer input initially provided. For each iteration, the input string `s` was split into two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. After all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the values from the last test case. The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`. Additionally, if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` holds. If the sum of `a` and `b` is not even, the condition `(a + b) % 2 != 0` holds.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input, splits it into two integers `a` and `b`, and then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints "bob". If the sum is odd, it prints "alice". After processing all test cases, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the values from the last test case, and the variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., cannot remove a coin because the wallet is empty) loses the game.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game essentially reduces to a parity problem. The total number of coins (a + b) determines the outcome.
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will end in a way where both players will have an equal number of moves, and the player who starts (Alice) will lose.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the player who starts (Alice) will have one more move than the other player (Bob), and thus Alice will win.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks if the sum of the coins is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "alice".

4. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the output for each test case. It only prints the result for the last test case because the `if` statement is outside the loop.
   - The output format is incorrect. It should print "Alice" or "Bob" without extra spaces.

5. **Corrected Program**:
   - The `if` statement should be inside the loop to handle each test case individually.
   - The output should be formatted correctly to match the problem's requirements.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(s.split()[0])
        b = int(s.split()[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.
- The corrected program correctly handles each test case and prints the results in the required format.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
