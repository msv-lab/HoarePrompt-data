Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer input initially provided.
   - For each iteration, the input string `s` was split into two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - After all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the values from the last test case.
   - The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`.
   - The sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('alice')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'alice'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the values of `a` and `b` and the variable `i`, but these values are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The condition that the sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2 is also not relevant to the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'alice'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Output: **alice**
