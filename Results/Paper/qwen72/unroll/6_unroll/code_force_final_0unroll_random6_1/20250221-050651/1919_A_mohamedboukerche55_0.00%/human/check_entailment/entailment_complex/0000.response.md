Reasoning:

The program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times. However, it only processes the last test case because it overwrites the values of `a` and `b` in each iteration. The correct approach would be to process each test case inside the loop and print the result for each one.

2. **Output Format**: The program prints "bob" and "alice" with extra spaces. The correct output should be "Bob" and "Alice" without any extra spaces.

3. **Logic for Determining the Winner**: The logic to determine the winner is correct. If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob wins; if it's odd, Alice wins. This is because the game is essentially a parity game, where the player who starts with an odd total number of coins in both wallets will always win if both players play optimally.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()  # Read the input for the current test case
        a, b = map(int, s.split())  # Split the input and convert to integers
        
        # Determine the winner based on the sum of coins
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Explanation of the Issues:
- **Overwriting `a` and `b`**: The original program overwrites `a` and `b` in each iteration of the loop, so only the last test case is processed. This is incorrect because the program should handle each test case independently.
- **Extra Spaces in Output**: The original program prints "bob  " and "alice" with extra spaces, which does not match the expected output format.
- **Function Definition**: The function definition does not include parameters for `a` and `b`, which is not necessary for this problem since the inputs are read within the function. However, the function should be designed to handle multiple test cases correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
