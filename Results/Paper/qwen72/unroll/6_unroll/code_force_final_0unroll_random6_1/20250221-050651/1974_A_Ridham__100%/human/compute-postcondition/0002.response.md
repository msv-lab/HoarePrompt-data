The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will start at 0 if the loop is to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list**
