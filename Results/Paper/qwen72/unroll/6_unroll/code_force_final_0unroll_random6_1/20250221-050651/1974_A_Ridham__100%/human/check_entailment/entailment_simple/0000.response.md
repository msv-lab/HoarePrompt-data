### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - It also calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - The total space required is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program determines the number of screens required to place all the 2x2 icons. If `y` is even, it divides `y` by 2 to get the number of screens. If `y` is odd, it divides `y` by 2 and adds 1 to account for the extra screen needed for the last 2x2 icon.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the remaining cells on the screens after placing all the 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).

5. **Placement of 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x`) is less than or equal to the remaining cells, the program appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result list.
   - If the space required for the 1x1 icons exceeds the remaining cells, the program calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons (`extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`).

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, one per line.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
  - The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correct. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. Therefore, the number of screens required for `y` 2x2 icons is `y // 2 + (y % 2)`, which is correctly implemented.

- **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
  - The calculation of remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons is correct. Each screen has 15 cells, and the total space occupied by `y` 2x2 icons is `4 * y`.

- **Placement of 1x1 Icons**:
  - The logic for placing 1x1 icons is also correct. If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all the 1x1 icons, the program correctly appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons and appends the total number of screens.

### Edge Cases:

- **No Icons**:
  - If both `x` and `y` are 0, the program correctly outputs 0 screens.
- **Only 1x1 Icons**:
  - If `y` is 0, the program correctly calculates the number of screens required for `x` 1x1 icons.
- **Only 2x2 Icons**:
  - If `x` is 0, the program correctly calculates the number of screens required for `y` 2x2 icons.
- **Mixed Icons**:
  - The program correctly handles cases where both 1x1 and 2x2 icons are present, ensuring that the minimum number of screens is used.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The edge cases are handled appropriately, and the output format matches the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
