Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it processes the list `a` to compute a final integer value `ans` based on the values of `a` and `k`. The function then appends this computed value to a list `ans_list`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each value in `ans_list` one by one. The final state of the program is that `ans_list` contains the results for each test case, and these results are printed to the console. The original input values `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are not retained after the function completes. **
