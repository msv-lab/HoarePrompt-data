The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop head, but it is mentioned that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, which suggests that `t` is the number of test cases. Therefore, `int(input())` should be equal to `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be equal to `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ans_list` is an empty list**
