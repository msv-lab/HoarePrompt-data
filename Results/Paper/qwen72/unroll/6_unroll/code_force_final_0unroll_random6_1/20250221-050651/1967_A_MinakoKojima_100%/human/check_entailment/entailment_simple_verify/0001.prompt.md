You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given `n` types of cards, each with a certain count `a_i`.
   - We can buy up to `k` additional cards of any type.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A subarray of length `n` is a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]` if and only if it contains exactly one of each type of card.
   - To maximize the score, we need to ensure that the counts of each card type are as balanced as possible.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - **Sort the Counts:** The program starts by sorting the counts of the cards. This helps in identifying the minimum count and balancing the counts.
   - **Initial Minimum Count:** The initial minimum count is `a[0]` after sorting.
   - **Balance the Counts:** The program iterates through the sorted counts and tries to balance them by using the available coins `k`.
     - For each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, it calculates the difference `dif` between the current count `a[i]` and the next count `a[i+1]`.
     - If `k` is sufficient to balance the counts up to `a[i+1]`, it updates the minimum count `ans` and reduces `k` accordingly.
     - If `k` is not sufficient, it uses the remaining coins to balance the counts as much as possible and breaks the loop.
   - **Final Adjustment:** If there are still coins left after the loop, it uses them to further balance the counts.
   - **Calculate the Score:** The score is calculated by adding the balanced minimum count `ans` and the remaining unbalanced counts.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `ans` is initialized to the minimum count `a[0]`.
     - `res` is initialized to `n - 1`, representing the number of unbalanced counts.
   - **Balancing Loop:**
     - For each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, the program checks if the difference `dif` between `a[i]` and `a[i+1]` can be covered by the remaining coins `k`.
     - If `k` is sufficient, it updates `ans` and reduces `k` by `dif * (i + 1)`.
     - If `k` is not sufficient, it updates `ans` by `k // (i + 1)` and adjusts `res` by `k % (i + 1)`.
   - **Final Score Calculation:**
     - If `k` is still not zero, it further updates `ans` by `k // n` and `res` by `k % n`.
     - The final score is calculated as `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is zero by breaking the loop early.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is not sufficient to balance all counts by using the remaining coins to balance as much as possible.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly balances the counts and calculates the maximum score.
   - The logic for balancing the counts and calculating the score is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to balance the counts of the cards and calculate the maximum score for the given problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, ensuring that the solution is optimal.
