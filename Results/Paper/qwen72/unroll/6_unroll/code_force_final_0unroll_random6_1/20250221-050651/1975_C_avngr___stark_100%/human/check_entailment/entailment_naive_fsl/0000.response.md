Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it only considers subarrays of length 3, which is not sufficient to handle all cases as described in the problem. The problem states that Mocha can choose any subarray of length 2 or more, and the median of that subarray can be used to set all values in the subarray to that median. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program will output `3`, but the correct answer is `4` as shown in the problem description. The program fails to consider subarrays of length greater than 3, which can lead to a higher median value. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
