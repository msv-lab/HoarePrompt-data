You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving an array `a` of positive integers. However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, and `a` to match the problem description. The preconditions for these parameters are: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        
        max = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        
        print(max)
        
    #State: The variable `t` is decremented to 0, `n` is the last input integer read, and `a` is the last list of `n` positive integers read. The loop prints the minimum value of `a` if `n` is 2, otherwise it prints the maximum of the second smallest elements in every consecutive triplet of `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, each between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
