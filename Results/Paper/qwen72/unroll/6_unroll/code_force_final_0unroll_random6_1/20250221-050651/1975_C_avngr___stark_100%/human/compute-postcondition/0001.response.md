The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly initialized before the loop starts, as it will be handled by the `range(t)` function. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0, and `_` will be managed by the loop itself.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
