Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the insertion and deletion operations as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element, but it does not perform the deletion step correctly. The problem requires that after each insertion, the selected element is removed from the array, and the indices of the elements to the right of the removed element are adjusted. The program, however, does not remove elements from `a` or adjust the indices of the remaining elements after each operation. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
The correct sequence of operations should be:
1. Select `i = 3` (last element), insert `3 + 3 = 6` into `S`, and delete `3` from `a`. Now `a = [1, 2]` and `S = {6}`.
2. Select `i = 2` (last element), insert `2 + 2 = 4` into `S`, and delete `2` from `a`. Now `a = [1]` and `S = {6, 4}`.
3. Select `i = 1` (last element), insert `1 + 1 = 2` into `S`, and delete `1` from `a`. Now `a = []` and `S = {6, 4, 2}`.

The sorted set `S` in descending order is `[6, 4, 2]`, which is the lexicographically largest array `b`.

However, the program will output:
```
6 4 3
```
This is incorrect because the element `3` was not properly removed from `a` after the first operation, and the indices were not adjusted correctly. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
