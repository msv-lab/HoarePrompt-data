### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and loops through each test case.
   - However, the function `func_1` is called without passing any arguments, which is inconsistent with the initial comment suggesting that `func_1` should take `t` and `test_cases` as arguments. This is a minor issue since the function itself does not use these parameters.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the function reads the length `n` and the list `a` from user input.
   - It then modifies the list `a` by incrementing each element by its index plus one. This step is correct and aligns with the problem description.
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each element in the modified list `a` and then converts `a` to a set to ensure all elements are unique. This is also correct.

3. **Constructing the Lexicographically Largest Array `b`:**
   - The program sorts the unique elements of `a` in descending order.
   - It then constructs the list `ans` by iterating through the sorted unique elements of `a` and inserting additional numbers between them to ensure that the difference between consecutive elements is at least 1.
   - The program correctly handles the insertion of additional numbers by using the `counter` to avoid duplicates and ensuring the total number of elements in `ans` is equal to `n`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Issues:
- **Function Signature Mismatch:**
  - The function `func_1` is defined without any parameters, but the comments suggest it should take `t` and `test_cases` as arguments. This is not a functional issue since the function does not use these parameters, but it is inconsistent with the comments.
- **Redundant Counter Decrement:**
  - The program decrements the counter for each element in `a` after adding it to `ans`, but this is not necessary since the elements are already unique and the counter is not used further.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor issues with the function signature and the redundant counter decrements, the program correctly follows the problem description and produces the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
