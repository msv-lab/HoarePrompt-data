Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one. However, the function `func_1` is not defined to take any arguments, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take the test case data as input.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but it should be defined to take the test case data as input, such as `def func_1(t, test_cases):`.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Inside `func_1`, the function reads the length `n` and the list `a` for each test case. It then modifies each element of `a` by adding the corresponding index plus one.
   - The modified list `a` is then converted to a set to remove duplicates, and sorted in descending order.

4. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of the frequency of each element in the modified list `a`.
   - It then constructs the result list `ans` by adding elements from `a` in descending order and inserting additional numbers to ensure the difference between consecutive elements is at least 1, while maintaining the total number of elements equal to `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The final result list `ans` is printed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the modified list `a` has duplicates by using the `Counter` and ensuring that the additional numbers are inserted in a way that maintains the lexicographically largest order.

7. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic of the program aligns with the problem description. It correctly modifies the elements of `a`, removes duplicates, and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b`.

However, the function `func_1` should be defined to take the test case data as input, and the main loop should pass the test case data to `func_1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the function definition and the way test cases are handled.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, the function `func_1` should be defined to take the test case data as input, and the main loop should pass the test case data to `func_1`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, a):
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    print(*ans)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, a)
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for the given problem.
