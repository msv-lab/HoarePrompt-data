Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have an array `a` of length `n`.
   - We need to perform `n` operations where in each operation:
     - We select an index `i` such that `1 <= i <= |a|`.
     - We insert `a[i] + i` into a set `S`.
     - We delete `a[i]` from `a`.
   - After `n` operations, `a` will be empty.
   - We need to construct a new array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order.
   - The goal is to find the lexicographically largest `b`.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.
   - It then modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element.
   - It converts the modified array `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.
   - It then constructs the array `b` by:
     - Adding elements from the sorted set `a` to `b`.
     - If there are duplicate elements, it adds the largest possible unique elements that are less than the current element.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed array `b`.

3. **Checking the Steps**:
   - **Modification of Elements**: The program correctly modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]`.
   - **Counting Occurrences**: Using `Counter` to count occurrences of each modified element is appropriate.
   - **Removing Duplicates and Sorting**: Converting `a` to a set and sorting it in descending order ensures that we have the unique elements in the correct order.
   - **Constructing `b`**:
     - The program correctly handles the insertion of elements from the sorted set into `b`.
     - It also handles the insertion of the largest possible unique elements that are less than the current element to ensure the lexicographically largest `b`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle cases where all elements in `a` are the same.
   - It should handle cases where `a` has a large number of elements and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The output should match the expected lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
