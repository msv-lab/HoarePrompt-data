Output State: **The list `a` is now sorted in descending order, each element is unique as in the initial state but without duplicates. The integer `n` and the other variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of the elements in the updated list `a`. `cnt` is equal to `n - len(a)`.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is calculated as the difference between the integer `n` and the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is sorted in descending order and contains unique elements without duplicates, and the integer `n` and other variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. The `counter` object still holds the frequency count of the elements in the updated list `a`.
