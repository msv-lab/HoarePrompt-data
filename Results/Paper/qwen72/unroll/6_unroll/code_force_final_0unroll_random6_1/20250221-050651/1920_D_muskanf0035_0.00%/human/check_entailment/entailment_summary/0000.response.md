Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes the operations and builds the array `a` according to the given rules.
   - For `op_type == 1`, it appends the integer `value` to the array.
   - For `op_type == 2`, it extends the array by appending `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - It then processes the queries by returning the element at the position `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query `k`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, the number of operations `n`, and the number of queries `q` for each test case.
   - It reads the operations and queries and passes them to `func_1`.
   - It prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue in `func_1`:
- The line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is incorrect for the `op_type == 2` case. This line duplicates the current array once, regardless of the value of `x`. The correct implementation should duplicate the array `x` times, which can be done using `array.extend(array * (value - 1))`.

Given this issue, the program will not correctly handle the `op_type == 2` operations as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
