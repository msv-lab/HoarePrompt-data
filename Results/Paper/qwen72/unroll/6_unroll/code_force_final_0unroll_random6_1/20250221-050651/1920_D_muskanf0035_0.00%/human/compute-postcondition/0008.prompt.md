You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, operations is a list of tuples (op_type, value) where op_type is an integer in {1, 2} and value is an integer such that 1 <= value <= n for op_type = 1 and 1 <= value <= 10^9 for op_type = 2, queries is a list of positive integers k such that 1 <= k <= min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after all operations.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples (op_type, value) where op_type is an integer in {1, 2} and value is an integer such that 1 <= value <= n for op_type = 1 and 1 <= value <= 10^9 for op_type = 2, `queries` is a list of positive integers k such that 1 <= k <= min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after all operations, `array` is a list containing the elements appended and extended according to the operations, `result` is an empty list.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: `result` is a list containing the elements from `array` at the positions specified by the `queries`, where each query `k` corresponds to the element at the index `(k - 1) % len(array)`. The `array` and `queries` remain unchanged.
    return result
    #The program returns the list `result` which contains the elements from `array` at the positions specified by the `queries`, where each query `k` corresponds to the element at the index `(k - 1) % len(array)`. The `array` and `queries` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `operations` (a list of tuples where each tuple is `(op_type, value)` with `op_type` being an integer in {1, 2} and `value` being an integer within specific ranges based on `op_type`), and `queries` (a list of positive integers). The function returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the positions specified by the `queries`, where each query `k` corresponds to the element at the index `(k - 1) % len(array)`. The `array` and `queries` remain unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `result` which contains the elements from `array` at the positions specified by the `queries`, where each query `k` corresponds to the element at the index `(k - 1) % len(array)`. The `array` and `queries` remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
