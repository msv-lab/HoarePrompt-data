Output State: **The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and for each iteration, the `result` list has been printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` are reset to their initial states at the beginning of each iteration, so their final values are not meaningful after the loop completes. The only lasting effect is the output produced by the `print` statement for each iteration, which consists of the results of the `func_1` function for the given `n`, `operations`, and `queries` in each iteration.**
