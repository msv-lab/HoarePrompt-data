Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly processes the operations to build the array `array` according to the given rules.
   - For `op_type == 1`, it appends the value to the array.
   - For `op_type == 2`, it extends the array by duplicating the current array `value` times. However, the implementation in the provided code only duplicates the array once, which is incorrect. The correct implementation should duplicate the array `value` times, not just once.
   - The function then processes the queries and returns the correct elements from the array based on the modulo operation to handle large indices.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function correctly reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters for each test case.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

However, the critical issue is in `func_1` where the array extension for `op_type == 2` is incorrect. The array should be extended `value` times, but the current implementation only extends it once. This will lead to incorrect results for test cases where `op_type == 2` and `value > 1`.

Given this, the program is **incorrect** because it does not meet the problem description for the second type of operation.

Correctness: **False**
