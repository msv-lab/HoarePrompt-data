n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), operations is a list of n tuples where each tuple is of the form (b, x) with b being 1 or 2 and x being a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n for b=1 and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 for b=2), and queries is a list of q positive integers (1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c)) where c is the size of the array after all operations.
