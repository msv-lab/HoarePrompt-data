Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the number of '-' characters and then prints the length of the string minus twice the number of '-' characters, unless the number of '-' characters is equal to the length of the string, in which case it prints the length of the string. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty, which involves more complex logic to balance the sums of the subarrays.

For example, in the third test case where the input string is `"+-+-+-"`, the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to split it into `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`. However, the program would output `0` only by chance, and it does not correctly handle other cases where the optimal split is not trivial.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to implement a more sophisticated algorithm that considers the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
