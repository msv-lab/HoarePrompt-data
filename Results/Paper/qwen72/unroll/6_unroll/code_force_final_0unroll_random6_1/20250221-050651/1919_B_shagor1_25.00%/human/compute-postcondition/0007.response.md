Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from user input. It counts the number of "-" characters in `s` and prints the result of `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the printed result and the unchanged values of `n` and `s`. **
