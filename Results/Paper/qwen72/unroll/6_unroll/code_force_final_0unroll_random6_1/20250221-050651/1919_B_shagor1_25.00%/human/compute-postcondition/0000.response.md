Output State: **The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-". For each test case, `1 <= t <= 1000` and `1 <= n <= 5000`. `n` is an input integer.**
