You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, num2 is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `num2` remains unchanged, `order` is the number of times an element in the list `a` is not greater than the next element.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True.
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can help achieve this maximum beauty.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array elements \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\).

3. **Array Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the array \(a\) in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The sorted array ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are minimized for each pair of consecutive elements, but the sum of these differences is maximized.

4. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the beauty by summing the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - This is done using a loop that iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) and adds the difference \(b[x] - b[x-1]\) to the `beauty` variable.

5. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, the beauty is 0, and the program prints 0.
   - However, this check is not necessary because the beauty of a sorted array is always the same, and the program can directly calculate the beauty without this check.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary Function**:
  - The function `func_1` is unnecessary. The beauty of a sorted array is always the same, and the program can directly calculate it without checking if the array is already sorted.
  - This function can be removed to simplify the code.

- **Edge Case**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where all elements are the same (e.g., the second test case with all elements being 69).

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but can be simplified by removing the unnecessary `func_1` function. The logic for sorting and calculating the beauty is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True** (but can be improved by removing the unnecessary function).
