The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `num2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num2`. The loop starts with `i` at 1 and iterates up to `num2 - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `num2` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 1 by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 < num2 <= 500, `order` is 0, `i` is 1**
