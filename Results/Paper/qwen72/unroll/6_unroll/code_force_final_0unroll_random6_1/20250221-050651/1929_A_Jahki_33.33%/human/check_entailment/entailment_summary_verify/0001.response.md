### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can help achieve this maximum beauty.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array elements \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\).

3. **Array Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the array \(a\) in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The sorted array ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are minimized for each pair of consecutive elements, but the sum of these differences is maximized.

4. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the beauty by summing the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - This is done using a loop that iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) and adds the difference \(b[x] - b[x-1]\) to the `beauty` variable.

5. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, the program prints 0.
   - However, this check is not necessary because the beauty of a sorted array is always the same, and the program can directly calculate the beauty without this check.
   - The function `func_1` is incorrect in its logic. It returns `True` if the array is strictly increasing, but the problem does not require the array to be strictly increasing; it only needs to be in non-decreasing order. Even if the array is not strictly increasing, the beauty calculation should still proceed.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary Function**:
  - The function `func_1` is unnecessary. The beauty of a sorted array is always the same, and the program can directly calculate it without checking if the array is already sorted.
  - This function can be removed to simplify the code.

- **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` returns `True` if the array is strictly increasing, but the problem does not require the array to be strictly increasing. It only needs to be in non-decreasing order.
  - This can lead to incorrect results in cases where the array is non-decreasing but not strictly increasing.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program without the unnecessary `func_1` function:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is mostly correct in identifying that the program can be simplified by removing the unnecessary `func_1` function.
- However, the original assessment did not correctly identify the issue with the logic in `func_1`, which can lead to incorrect results.
- The corrected program without `func_1` is correct and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1` and the unnecessary function.)
