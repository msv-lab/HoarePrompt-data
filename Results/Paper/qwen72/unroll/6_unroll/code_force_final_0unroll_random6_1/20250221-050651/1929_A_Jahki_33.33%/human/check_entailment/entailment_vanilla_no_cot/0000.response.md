Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is Misused**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the program prints `0`. However, this is not the correct approach because even if the array is sorted, it does not necessarily mean the maximum beauty is `0`. The maximum beauty is determined by the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which can be positive even if the array is already sorted.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Beauty**:
   - The program calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, this is not the correct way to maximize the beauty. The maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array in non-increasing order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty of the array, you should:
1. Sort the array in non-increasing order.
2. Calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in this sorted array.

### Corrected Program:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x - 1] - b[x]
    print(beauty)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sorting in Non-Increasing Order**: `b = sorted(a, reverse=True)` sorts the array in descending order.
- **Calculating Beauty**: The loop `for x in range(1, num2): beauty += b[x - 1] - b[x]` calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which gives the maximum beauty.

This corrected program will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
