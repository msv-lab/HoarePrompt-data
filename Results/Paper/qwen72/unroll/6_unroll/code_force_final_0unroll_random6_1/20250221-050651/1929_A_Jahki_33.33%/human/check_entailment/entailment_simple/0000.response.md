### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`num2`) and the array elements (`a`).

2. **Array Validation:**
   - The program ensures that `a` is a list of integers by using a list comprehension to filter out non-integer values from the input.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the array and counts the number of times an element is not greater than the next element (`order`).
   - If `order` is 0, it means the array is already sorted, and the function returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints 0, which is correct because the beauty of a sorted array is 0.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The beauty is calculated as \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_1` Misuse:**
  - The function `func_1` is checking if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, but the problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is achieved by sorting the array in non-decreasing order and then calculating the beauty.
  - The function `func_1` is unnecessary and can be removed because the beauty is always maximized by sorting the array, regardless of its initial order.

### Corrected Program:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** because it uses an unnecessary function `func_1` that does not contribute to the solution. The beauty of the array is always maximized by sorting the array and then calculating the differences, which is what the corrected program does.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
