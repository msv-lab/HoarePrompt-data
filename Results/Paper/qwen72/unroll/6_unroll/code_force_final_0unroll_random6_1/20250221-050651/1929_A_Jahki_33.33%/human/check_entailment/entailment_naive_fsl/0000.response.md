Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the array are the same. According to the problem description, if all elements are the same, the beauty of the array should be 0, as the difference between any two consecutive elements will always be 0. However, the program incorrectly prints the sum of differences, which should be 0, but it does not handle this edge case properly.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
69 69 69
```
The expected output is 0, but the program will print 0 because it does not rearrange the array and directly calculates the beauty. However, the function `func_1` is not necessary for this problem and does not contribute to the correct solution. The program should simply sort the array and calculate the beauty, which would handle all cases correctly.

A corrected version of the program would be:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```
This version directly sorts the array and calculates the beauty, which is the correct approach for maximizing the beauty of the array.
