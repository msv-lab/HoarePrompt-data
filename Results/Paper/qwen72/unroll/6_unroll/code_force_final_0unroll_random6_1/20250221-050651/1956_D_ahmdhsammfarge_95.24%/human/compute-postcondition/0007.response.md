Output State: **lst is a list of integers, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), ops is a list that contains the operations [r + 1, l + 1] once or twice and now also contains the operation [r + 1, r + 1] and [r + 1, l + 1] again, n is equal to l - r + 1.** 

The value of `n` is calculated as `l - r + 1`, which represents the number of elements in the sublist from index `r` to index `l` inclusive. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
