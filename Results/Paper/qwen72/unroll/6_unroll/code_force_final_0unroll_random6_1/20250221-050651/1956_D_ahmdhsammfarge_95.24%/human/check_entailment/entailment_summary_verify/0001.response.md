### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the array by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The MEX value of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - We need to ensure that the total number of operations does not exceed 5 * 10^5.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**
   - This function is intended to find the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX value, maximizes the sum of the array.
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and computes a potential sum.
   - However, the potential sum is calculated incorrectly. The function uses `(j - i + 1) ** 2` to approximate the MEX value, which is not correct. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - Therefore, `func_1` does not correctly identify the optimal subarray to maximize the sum.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**
   - This function is intended to generate a sequence of operations to set the subarray `a[r...l]` to the MEX value.
   - The function recursively adds operations to the list `ops` to set the subarray to the MEX value.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the MEX value or the subarray replacement logic. It simply appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` without ensuring that the MEX value is correctly computed and applied.
   - This function is also flawed and does not solve the problem correctly.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**
   - This function is intended to perform the operation on the subarray `a[r...l]` and update the array `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
   - It adds an operation to set the subarray to the MEX value.
   - It checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0 and adds an additional operation if true.
   - It then recursively calls `func_2` to generate more operations.
   - Finally, it sets the subarray to the MEX value, which is the length of the subarray.
   - The logic here is also flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX value. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the length of the subarray.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the MEX value or the optimal subarray to maximize the sum. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` contain logical errors and do not follow the correct approach to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
