Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to find the optimal range `[r, l]` to maximize the sum of the array, but it does not correctly compute the MEX value for the chosen range. The MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the range, and the program should update the elements in the range to this MEX value, not to `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.

Additionally, the functions `func_2` and `func_3` are not correctly handling the operations to update the array and construct the sequence of operations. For example, in `func_3`, the operations are added multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to more operations than allowed.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
0 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6 1
1 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will not correctly compute the MEX value for the range `[1, 3]` and will not update the array elements to the MEX value. Instead, it will perform incorrect operations and may not achieve the maximum sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
