The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `r` and `l` where `r` is less than or equal to `l`, and a list `ops` that can contain sublists of two integers. It modifies the `ops` list by appending sublists of the form `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, depending on the difference between `r` and `l`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `ops` list will contain a series of sublists, each of which is `[r + 1, l + 1]`, and the number of such sublists will be `2^(l - r)`. The original values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged.
