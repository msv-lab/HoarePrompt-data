Postcondition: **lst is a list of integers, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), and ops is a list that contains the operations [r + 1, l + 1]. If the minimum value in the sublist lst[r:l + 1] is 0, then ops contains the operations [r + 1, l + 1] twice. Otherwise, ops contains the operations [r + 1, l + 1] once.**
