### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the array by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The MEX value of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The goal is to find the optimal sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum, using no more than 500,000 operations.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**
   - The function aims to find the subarray `a[l...r]` that, when replaced with its MEX value, maximizes the sum of the array.
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and computes the potential sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX value.
   - However, the MEX value is incorrectly approximated by `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is the square of the subarray length. This is not the correct way to compute the MEX value.
   - The correct MEX value should be computed by finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - Therefore, the function does not correctly compute the MEX value or the optimal subarray to maximize the sum.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**
   - This function is intended to generate a sequence of operations to set the subarray `a[r...l]` to the MEX value.
   - It recursively adds operations to the list `ops` to set the subarray to the MEX value.
   - The function does not correctly handle the MEX value or the subarray replacement logic. It simply adds operations to set the subarray to the MEX value, but the MEX value is not computed correctly.
   - The recursive calls are redundant and do not contribute to the correct solution.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**
   - This function is intended to perform the operation on the subarray `a[r...l]` and update the array `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
   - It adds an operation to set the subarray to the MEX value.
   - It checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0 and adds an additional operation if true.
   - It then recursively calls `func_2` to generate more operations.
   - Finally, it sets the subarray to the MEX value, which is the length of the subarray.
   - The logic here is also flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX value. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the length of the subarray.

5. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program logic repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the optimal subarray and then `func_3` to perform the operation.
   - After all operations are performed, it replaces any remaining 0s in the array with 1s.
   - The final sum and the list of operations are printed.
   - Since the MEX value is not computed correctly in `func_1` and `func_3`, the operations generated will not maximize the sum of the array as intended.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the MEX value or the optimal subarray to maximize the sum. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` contain logical errors and do not follow the correct approach to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
