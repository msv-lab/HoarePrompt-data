Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - This function attempts to find the optimal range `[r, l]` to maximize the sum of the array after performing the operation. However, it calculates the sum incorrectly. The MEX of a subarray is not necessarily equal to the length of the subarray squared. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray.
   - The function should compute the MEX of the subarray and then use that value to update the sum.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - This function is intended to recursively add operations to the list `ops`. However, it does not correctly handle the MEX operation and the updating of the array elements.
   - The function does not ensure that the operations are valid or that they maximize the sum.

3. **Function 3 (func_3)**:
   - This function attempts to apply the MEX operation to the subarray and then recursively add more operations. However, it does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray.
   - The function also does not ensure that the operations are valid or that they maximize the sum.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to:

1. **Compute the MEX of a subarray**: The MEX of a subarray can be computed by finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray.
2. **Apply the MEX operation**: Update the subarray with the MEX value and keep track of the operations.
3. **Maximize the sum**: Ensure that the operations you perform lead to the maximum possible sum of the array.

### Example of a Correct Solution:

```python
def mex(subarray):
    seen = set(subarray)
    mex_value = 0
    while mex_value in seen:
        mex_value += 1
    return mex_value

def maximize_sum(n, a):
    operations = []
    max_sum = sum(a)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            subarray = a[i:j+1]
            mex_value = mex(subarray)
            new_sum = sum(a[:i]) + sum(a[j+1:]) + (j - i + 1) * mex_value
            if new_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = new_sum
                operations = [(i, j)]
                a[i:j+1] = [mex_value] * (j - i + 1)
    
    return max_sum, len(operations), operations

# Example usage:
n = 4
a = [1, 100, 2, 1]
max_sum, num_ops, ops = maximize_sum(n, a)
print(max_sum, num_ops)
for op in ops:
    print(op[0] + 1, op[1] + 1)
```

This solution correctly computes the MEX of each subarray, applies the operation, and keeps track of the operations to maximize the sum of the array.
