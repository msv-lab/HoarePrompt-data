Output State: **lst is a list of integers, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), ops is a list that contains the operations [r + 1, l + 1] once or twice and now also contains the operation [r + 1, r + 1]. The function `func_2` has been called with arguments `r`, `l`, and `ops`.**
