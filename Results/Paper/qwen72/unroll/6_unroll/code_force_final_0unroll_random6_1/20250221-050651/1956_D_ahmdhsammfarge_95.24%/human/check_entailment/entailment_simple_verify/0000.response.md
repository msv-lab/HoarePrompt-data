Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not correctly implement the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **MEX Calculation in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the optimal range `[r, l]` to maximize the sum of the array by computing the MEX value for the chosen range. However, the function incorrectly computes the sum `sm` as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. This is not the MEX value; it is simply the sum of the elements outside the range plus the square of the range length.
   - The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the range `[i, j]`, and the elements in this range should be set to this MEX value.

2. **Incorrect Operations in `func_3`:**
   - The function `func_3` is supposed to update the elements in the range `[r, l]` to the MEX value and construct the sequence of operations. However, it incorrectly sets the elements in the range to `n = l - r + 1` (the length of the range), which is not the MEX value.
   - Additionally, the function adds the same operation multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to more operations than allowed.

3. **Redundant Operations in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` is designed to recursively add operations to the `ops` list. However, it adds the same operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, which is not required and can lead to an excessive number of operations.

4. **Final Loop to Replace Zeros:**
   - The final loop in the main program attempts to replace all zeros in the list with ones. While this might help in some cases, it does not ensure that the array is maximized correctly according to the MEX operation.

Given these issues, the program will not correctly compute the MEX value for the chosen range and will not update the array elements to the MEX value. Therefore, it will not achieve the maximum sum of the elements of the array.

**Example Case:**
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  0 1 2
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  6 1
  1 3
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  - The program will not correctly compute the MEX value for the range `[1, 3]` and will not update the array elements to the MEX value. Instead, it will perform incorrect operations and may not achieve the maximum sum.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
