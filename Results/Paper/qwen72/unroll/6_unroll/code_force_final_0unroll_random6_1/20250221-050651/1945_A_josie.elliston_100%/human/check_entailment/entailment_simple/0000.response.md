Reasoning:

1. **Handling Introverts**: Each introvert must be placed in a separate tent. Therefore, the number of tents required for introverts is simply `introverts`.

2. **Handling Extroverts and Universals**: Extroverts need to be placed in tents with exactly two other people. Universals can be placed in any tent configuration, but we need to ensure that we can form groups of 3 for the extroverts. This means:
   - If the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3, we can directly use `extroverts / 3` tents for them.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if we can use the universals to form the required groups of 3. Specifically, we need at least `3 - (extroverts % 3)` universals to complete the last tent for the extroverts.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3. If not, it checks if there are enough universals to complete the last tent.
   - If there are not enough universals to complete the last tent, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts.
   - If there are enough universals, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents required for the extroverts and universals combined.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts, and the function returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents required for the introverts and the result of `func_1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no participants (i.e., `introverts = 0`, `extroverts = 0`, `universals = 0`), the function correctly returns `0`.
   - If there are only introverts, the function correctly returns the number of introverts.
   - If there are only extroverts and no universals, the function correctly returns `-1` if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3.
   - If there are only universals, the function correctly returns the ceiling of `universals / 3`.

6. **General Case**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where there are both extroverts and universals, ensuring that the extroverts can be accommodated in groups of 3 with the help of universals.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all the specified cases correctly and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
