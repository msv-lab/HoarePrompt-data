### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - **Extroverts:** Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two other people.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) can be accommodated with the available universals.
   - If the remaining extroverts plus the universals are less than 3, it is impossible to form a tent with exactly 3 people, so the function returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, the function returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`**
   - This function first calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so the function returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (each needing a separate tent) to the result from `func_1` and returns the total number of tents.

4. **Verification of the Solution:**
   - **Test Case 1: (1, 2, 3)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 2 extroverts need 1 tent with 1 universal.
     - Universals: 2 universals need 1 tent.
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts + 1 universal) + 1 (2 universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Test Case 2: (1, 4, 1)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 1 tent with 2 universals, but only 1 universal is available.
     - It is impossible to form a tent with exactly 3 people for the remaining 2 extroverts.
     - Total: -1.
   - **Test Case 3: (1, 4, 2)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 1 tent with 2 universals.
     - Universals: 0 universals left.
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts + 2 universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Test Case 4: (1, 1, 1)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 1 extrovert needs 2 more people, but only 1 universal is available.
     - It is impossible to form a tent with exactly 3 people.
     - Total: -1.
   - **Test Case 5: (1, 3, 2)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 3 extroverts need 1 tent.
     - Universals: 2 universals need 1 tent.
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts) + 1 (2 universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Test Case 6: (19, 7, 18)**
     - Introverts: 19 tents.
     - Extroverts: 7 extroverts need 3 tents with 2 universals each.
     - Universals: 18 - 6 = 12 universals left, which need 4 tents.
     - Total: 19 (introverts) + 3 (extroverts + 2 universals each) + 4 (remaining universals) = 26 tents.
   - **Test Case 7: (0, 0, 0)**
     - No participants, so no tents are needed.
     - Total: 0 tents.
   - **Test Case 8: (7, 0, 0)**
     - Introverts: 7 tents.
     - No extroverts or universals.
     - Total: 7 tents.
   - **Test Case 9: (0, 24, 0)**
     - No introverts or universals.
     - Extroverts: 24 extroverts need 8 tents.
     - Total: 8 tents.
   - **Test Case 10: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
     - Introverts: 1000000000 tents.
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 extroverts need 333333334 tents with 2 universals each.
     - Universals: 1000000000 - 666666668 = 333333332 universals left, which need 111111111 tents.
     - Total: 1000000000 (introverts) + 333333334 (extroverts + 2 universals each) + 111111111 (remaining universals) = 1666666667 tents.

### Correctness:
The provided program correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem. It ensures that introverts are given their own tents, extroverts are accommodated in tents with exactly two others, and universals are used to fill the remaining spots. The program also correctly returns `-1` when it is impossible to form the required tents.

Correctness: **True**
