You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where in each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an integer `k`, followed by a list `l` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence of `l` that is non-negative, and then computes a value using this maximum sum and `k`. The final result for each test case is printed, which is the value `(2


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and need to perform `k` operations.
   - In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, and the result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum to the array.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is positive, we can keep adding it to the array to maximize the total sum.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is zero or negative, the best strategy is to add zero (or the negative sum) to the array, which does not change the sum.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a simple approach to find the maximum subarray sum using a single pass through the array.
   - It maintains a running sum `c` and a maximum sum `maxi`.
   - If the current element is negative and the running sum `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the current element, it resets `c` to zero.
   - Otherwise, it adds the current element to `c` and updates `maxi` if `c` is greater than `maxi`.
   - After the loop, it ensures `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

4. **Formula for Maximum Sum:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible sum after `k` operations using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = (2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the idea that the maximum subarray sum `maxi` is added `2^k - 1` times to the original sum of the array.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the maximum subarray sum is zero or negative by ensuring `maxi` is the maximum of zero and the running sum.
   - It also handles the case where the array is empty or all elements are negative by correctly resetting `c` and updating `maxi`.

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The program correctly applies the modulo operation to ensure the result is within the required range.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the maximum subarray sum and applies the formula to compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
- The logic and the formula used are consistent with the problem requirements.
- The program handles edge cases and ensures the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
