Output State: **The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, it processes a list of n integers. After processing, it prints a value calculated from the list and the integer k. The variables t, n, k, and a remain unchanged as they are input values. The loop variables i, c, and maxi are reset for each iteration, and their final values are not retained after the loop completes. The sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5.**
