Output State: **The loop has processed all test cases. For each test case, if the sum of the transformed multipliers (which are the result of dividing the least common multiple of the original multipliers by each multiplier) is greater than or equal to the least common multiple, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is a space-separated list of the transformed multipliers. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has completed all iterations.**
