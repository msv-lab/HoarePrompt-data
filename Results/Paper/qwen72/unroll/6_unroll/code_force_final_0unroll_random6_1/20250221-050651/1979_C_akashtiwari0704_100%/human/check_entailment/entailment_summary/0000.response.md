Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **LCM Calculation**: The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` for each test case. This is a valid approach because the LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are integers and can be distributed in a way that the total sum of bets is a common multiple of the multipliers.

3. **Bet Calculation**: For each multiplier `k_i`, the program calculates the bet `x_i` as `LCM // k_i`. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet is `sum(LCM // k_i)`. The program then checks if this sum is strictly less than the LCM. If it is, the bets are valid because the return for any winning outcome will be `k_i * (LCM // k_i) = LCM`, which is greater than the total sum of bets.

4. **Output**: If the sum of bets is less than the LCM, the program prints the bets. If the sum of bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, the program prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution of bets exists.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if all multipliers are the same (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`), the sum of bets will be `5 * (LCM // 5) = LCM`, which is not strictly less than the LCM, so it correctly prints `-1`.

6. **Constraints**: The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description. It ensures that the bets are integers and within the specified range.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
