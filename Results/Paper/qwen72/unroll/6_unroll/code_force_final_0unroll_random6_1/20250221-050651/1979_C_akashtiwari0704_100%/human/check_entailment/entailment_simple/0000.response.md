### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the list of multipliers `a`.

2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the `lcm` function. This function iterates through the list of multipliers and computes the LCM using the greatest common divisor (GCD) method.
   - The LCM is used to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that the total sum of bets is less than the return for any winning outcome.

3. **Bets Calculation:**
   - The program then transforms each multiplier `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM of the multipliers.
   - This transformation ensures that the bet on each outcome is a fraction of the LCM, which is a common multiple of all multipliers.

4. **Sum of Bets:**
   - The program calculates the sum of the transformed bets `sumo`.
   - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1` because it means there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - If `sumo` is less than `prod`, it prints the transformed bets as a space-separated list.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the correct results based on the problem description. If a solution exists, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
- The logic for calculating the LCM and transforming the bets is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
- The condition to check if the sum of bets is less than the LCM is correctly implemented.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
