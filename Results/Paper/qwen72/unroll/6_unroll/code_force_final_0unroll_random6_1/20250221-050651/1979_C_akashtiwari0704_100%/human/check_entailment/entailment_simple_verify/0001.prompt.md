You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

    #State: The loop has processed all test cases. For each test case, if the sum of the transformed multipliers (which are the result of dividing the least common multiple of the original multipliers by each multiplier) is greater than or equal to the least common multiple, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is a space-separated list of the transformed multipliers. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has completed all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for the winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, the amount received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Approach in the Program:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i`.
   - It then sets the bet for each outcome `i` to `prod // k_i`, where `prod` is the LCM.
   - The total sum of bets is calculated and compared to `prod`.
   - If the total sum of bets is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program outputs `-1` indicating no valid solution.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the bets.

3. **Mathematical Justification:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers `k_i` ensures that the bets are proportional to the multipliers.
   - By setting `x_i = prod // k_i`, the amount received back for the winning outcome `i` is `k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(prod // k_i)`.
   - For the condition `sum(x_i) < prod` to hold, the sum of the bets must be strictly less than the LCM of the multipliers.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all `k_i` are the same, the sum of bets will be `n * (prod // k_i)`, which is `n * (prod // k)`.
   - For the condition to hold, `n * (prod // k) < prod`, which simplifies to `n < k`. If `n >= k`, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

5. **Implementation Details:**
   - The program uses the `gcd` function to compute the LCM.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases and the multipliers for each test case.
   - It correctly calculates the LCM and the bets.
   - It correctly checks the condition and outputs the results.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the edge cases and ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that satisfies the condition for all outcomes.

### Correctness:
**True**
