The only objects in the loop head are the variable `T` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, and `t` is an integer representing the total number of test cases. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `T` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and must be greater than 0, `T` is 0**
