Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the number of outcomes for each test case, along with the multipliers for each outcome.

2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculation**: The program calculates the LCM of the multipliers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module. The LCM is used to ensure that the bets are distributed in such a way that the total sum of bets is less than the return for any winning outcome.

3. **Bet Calculation**: For each outcome, the program calculates the bet as `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM of the multipliers. This ensures that the return for each winning outcome is `k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod`, which is the same for all outcomes.

4. **Sum of Bets**: The program sums up all the bets and checks if the total sum is less than `prod`. If it is, the program prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

5. **Output Formatting**: The program correctly formats the output as required, printing the bets separated by spaces or `-1` if no valid distribution exists.

The logic and implementation are sound and meet the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
