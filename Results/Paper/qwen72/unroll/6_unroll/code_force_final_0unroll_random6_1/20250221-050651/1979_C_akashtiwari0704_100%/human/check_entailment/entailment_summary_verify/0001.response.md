### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires distributing coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for the winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, the amount received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Approach in the Program:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i`.
   - It then sets the bet for each outcome `i` to `prod // k_i`, where `prod` is the LCM.
   - The total sum of bets is calculated and compared to `prod`.
   - If the total sum of bets is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program outputs `-1` indicating no valid solution.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the bets.

3. **Mathematical Justification:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers `k_i` ensures that the bets are proportional to the multipliers.
   - By setting `x_i = prod // k_i`, the amount received back for the winning outcome `i` is `k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(prod // k_i)`.
   - For the condition `sum(x_i) < prod` to hold, the sum of the bets must be strictly less than the LCM of the multipliers.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all `k_i` are the same, the sum of bets will be `n * (prod // k_i)`, which is `n * (prod // k)`.
   - For the condition to hold, `n * (prod // k) < prod`, which simplifies to `n < k`. If `n >= k`, the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - If `k_i` are different, the program should still ensure that the sum of bets is less than the LCM.

5. **Implementation Details:**
   - The program uses the `gcd` function to compute the LCM.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases and the multipliers for each test case.
   - It correctly calculates the LCM and the bets.
   - It correctly checks the condition and outputs the results.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program assumes that the LCM of the multipliers will always be a valid solution. This is generally true because the LCM ensures that the bets are proportional and the condition `sum(x_i) < prod` is checked.
   - However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where the LCM is very large and the sum of bets might exceed `10^9`. This is a constraint mentioned in the problem description, but it is unlikely to be an issue given the constraints on `k_i` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the edge cases and ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that satisfies the condition for all outcomes. The LCM approach is mathematically sound and the program's implementation aligns with the problem requirements.
