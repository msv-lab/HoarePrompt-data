You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the exponents of the stick lengths (2^{a_i}), and an integer `n` representing the number of sticks, where 1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 \le a_i \le n. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        v = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for _ in range(n):
            x = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            v[x] += 1
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if v[i] >= 2:
                ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
            if v[i] >= 3:
                ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
            cnt += v[i]
        
        results.append(str(ans))
        
    #State: `idx` is equal to the total number of elements in `data`, `t` is equal to `int(data[0])`, `results` is a list of strings where each string represents the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 sticks of the same length for each test case.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: - Since the exact values of the `results` list are not provided, we can only describe the structure of the output.
    #   - Each element of the `results` list will be printed on a new line.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. It returns "Yes" if the sum of the stick lengths (2^{a_i}) can form a square, and "No" otherwise.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
