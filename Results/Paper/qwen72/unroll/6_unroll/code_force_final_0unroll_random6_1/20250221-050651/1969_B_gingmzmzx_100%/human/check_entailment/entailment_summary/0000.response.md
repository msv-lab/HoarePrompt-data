### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - The program counts the number of '0's in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - It also initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - The program iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is '0', it increments `cnt[0]` and adds 1 to `ans` if there are any '1's before it (`cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is '1', it increments `cnt[1]` and adds the number of remaining '0's to `ans` (`zeroes - cnt[0]`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the computed value `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The algorithm aims to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string by performing cyclic shifts.
- The key idea is to count the number of '1's that appear before '0's and the number of '0's that appear after '1's, as these are the positions that need to be adjusted to sort the string.
- The cost is calculated by summing the lengths of the substrings that need to be cyclically shifted to move '1's to the right and '0's to the left.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1: "10"**
  - `zeroes = 1`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [0, 1]` -> `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 2: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [1, 1]` -> `ans = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2: "0000"**
  - `zeroes = 4`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1-4: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [4, 0]` -> `ans = 0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3: "11000"**
  - `zeroes = 3`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1-2: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [0, 2]` -> `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 3-5: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [3, 2]` -> `ans = 9`
  - Output: `9` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4: "101011"**
  - `zeroes = 2`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [0, 1]` -> `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 2: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [1, 1]` -> `ans = 1`
  - Iteration 3: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [1, 2]` -> `ans = 1`
  - Iteration 4: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [2, 2]` -> `ans = 3`
  - Iteration 5-6: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [2, 4]` -> `ans = 5`
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5: "01101001"**
  - `zeroes = 4`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [1, 0]` -> `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 2-3: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [1, 2]` -> `ans = 2`
  - Iteration 4: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [2, 2]` -> `ans = 4`
  - Iteration 5: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [2, 3]` -> `ans = 4`
  - Iteration 6-7: `c = 0` -> `cnt = [4, 3]` -> `ans = 7`
  - Iteration 8: `c = 1` -> `cnt = [4, 4]` -> `ans = 11`
  - Output: `11` (Correct)
