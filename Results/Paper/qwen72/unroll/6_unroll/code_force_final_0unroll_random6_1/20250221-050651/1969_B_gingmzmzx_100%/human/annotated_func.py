#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a binary string `s` as input, where `2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5` and each character in `s` is either '0' or '1'. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `n` will be 0, and the variable `s` will be the list representation of the last binary string input. The variables `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will be updated based on the last binary string input, where `zeroes` is the count of '0's in the last string, `cnt` is a list with two elements representing the counts of '0's and '1's in the last string, and `ans` is the computed answer for the last string. The number of test cases `t` and the sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`, counts the number of '0's and '1's in the string, and computes a value `ans` based on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string. The function prints the computed value `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variable `s` will contain the list representation of the last binary string input, and `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will reflect the state and results of the last test case.
