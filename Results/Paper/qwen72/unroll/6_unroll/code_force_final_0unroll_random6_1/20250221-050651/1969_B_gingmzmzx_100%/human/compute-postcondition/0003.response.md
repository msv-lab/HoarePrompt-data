The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `s` and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. The length of `s` is between 2 and 200,000, and each character in `s` is either '0' or '1'. The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10,000. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 200,000. The function returns a result based on the input string `s` and the number of test cases `t`.
