### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers. This is correct because the input is a binary string, and converting it to a list of integers (0s and 1s) is a valid step.

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The function counts the number of zeroes in the string using `s.count(0)`. This is correct and necessary for the algorithm.

3. **Initialization:**
   - The function initializes `cnt` as a list with two elements, both set to 0. This is used to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far in the string.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the total cost to sort the string.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The function iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - If `c` is 0, it increments `cnt[0]` and adds 1 to `ans` if `cnt[1]` (the count of 1s encountered so far) is greater than 0. This is because if there is a 1 before the current 0, a cyclic shift is needed to move the 0 to the left.
   - If `c` is 1, it increments `cnt[1]` and adds the difference `zeroes - cnt[0]` to `ans`. This is because the cost to move all remaining 0s to the left of the current 1 is the total number of 0s minus the number of 0s already encountered.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the computed value `ans` for each test case, which is the minimum total cost to sort the string.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where the string is already sorted correctly (e.g., "0000" in the example).
   - The function also handles the case where the string is not sorted and requires multiple cyclic shifts to become sorted.

7. **Efficiency:**
   - The function processes each character in the string exactly once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n) for each test case, where n is the length of the string.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to compute the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The algorithm is efficient and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
