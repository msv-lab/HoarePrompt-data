You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`, counts the number of '0's and '1's in the string, and computes a value `ans` based on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string. The function prints the computed value `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variable `s` will contain the list representation of the last binary string input, and `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will reflect the state and results of the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts.
   - A cyclic shift of a substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r \) costs \( r - l + 1 \) (the length of the substring).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it converts the input string \( s \) into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeroes in the string.
   - It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string and updates the counter and the answer based on the current character.

3. **Detailed Analysis of the Logic:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - For each character \( c \) in the string:
     - If \( c \) is 0, it adds 1 to `ans` if there is at least one 1 before it (`cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If \( c \) is 1, it adds the number of remaining zeroes to `ans` (`zeroes - cnt[0]`).

4. **Explanation of the Logic:**
   - The idea is to count the number of 1s that need to be moved to the right of the current 0, and the number of 0s that need to be moved to the left of the current 1.
   - The cost for each 0 is 1 if there is at least one 1 before it, because it needs to be moved to the left of the 1.
   - The cost for each 1 is the number of remaining zeroes, because each 1 needs to be moved to the right of all remaining 0s.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1: "10"**
     - `zeroes = 1`
     - `cnt = [0, 0]`
     - `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - Total cost: 2
   - **Example 2: "0000"**
     - `zeroes = 4`
     - `cnt = [0, 0]`
     - `ans = 0`
     - No 1s, so no cost is added.
     - Total cost: 0
   - **Example 3: "11000"**
     - `zeroes = 3`
     - `cnt = [0, 0]`
     - `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 2]`, `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [3, 2]`, `ans = 3` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - Total cost: 9
   - **Example 4: "101011"**
     - `zeroes = 2`
     - `cnt = [0, 0]`
     - `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 1`
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 3]`, `ans = 2`
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 4]`, `ans = 2`
     - Total cost: 5
   - **Example 5: "01101001"**
     - `zeroes = 4`
     - `cnt = [0, 0]`
     - `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 0]`, `ans = 0`
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 3` (since `zeroes - cnt[0] = 3`)
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 6` (since `zeroes - cnt[0] = 3`)
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 7` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 3]`, `ans = 9` (since `zeroes - cnt[0] = 2`)
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [3, 3]`, `ans = 10` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - For `c = 0`: `cnt = [4, 3]`, `ans = 11` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - For `c = 1`: `cnt = [4, 4]`, `ans = 11`
     - Total cost: 11
