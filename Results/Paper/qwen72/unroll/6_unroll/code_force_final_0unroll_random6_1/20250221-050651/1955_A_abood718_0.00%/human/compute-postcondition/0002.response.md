The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it can be inferred that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`. The constraints indicate that `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers within specific ranges. The function is expected to return a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function is designed to handle `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, and returns a result based on these parameters.**
