Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts on any chosen substring.
   - A cyclic shift of a substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r \) has a cost equal to the length of the substring \( r - l + 1 \).

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program should read the number of test cases \( t \) and then process each test case.
   - For each test case, it should read a binary string \( s \) and compute the minimum cost to sort it.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**:
     - This function is intended to process a single binary string.
     - It converts the input string to a list of integers using `input().split()`, which is incorrect for a binary string. The correct way to read a binary string is `input()`.
     - It initializes two variables: \( n \) to count the number of 1s and \( ans \) to accumulate the cost.
     - It iterates through the string, updating \( n \) when it encounters a 1.
     - If it encounters a 0 and \( n \) is not zero, it adds \( n + 1 \) to \( ans \).
     - Finally, it prints \( ans \).

   - **func_2**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases \( t \).
     - It then iterates \( t \) times, calling \( func_1 \) for each test case.

4. **Logical Errors**:
   - **func_1**:
     - The input is read using `input().split()`, which is incorrect for a binary string. It should be read as a single string using `input()`.
     - The function does not handle the case where the string is already sorted correctly. For example, the string "0000" should result in a cost of 0, but the current logic might not handle this correctly.
     - The logic for calculating the cost is flawed. It adds \( n + 1 \) to \( ans \) whenever a 0 is encountered and \( n \) is not zero. This does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the string. The correct approach should involve finding the longest contiguous segment of 1s and 0s and using the length of the string to determine the cost of the necessary cyclic shifts.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To sort a binary string, we need to move all 1s to the right of all 0s.
   - The minimum cost can be computed by finding the longest contiguous segment of 1s and 0s and using the length of the string to determine the cost of the necessary cyclic shifts.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to the issues mentioned above. Specifically, the input handling and the cost calculation logic are incorrect.

Final: **False**
