Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - This part is correct as it follows the problem description.

2. **Input Handling in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from the input and converts it into a list of integers.
   - However, the input is read using `input().split()`, which is incorrect for this problem. Binary strings do not contain spaces, so `split()` will not work as intended. Instead, the input should be read directly as a string and then converted to a list of integers.

3. **Cost Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `n` to 0, which will count the number of '1's in the string.
   - It also initializes `ans` to 0, which will accumulate the cost of sorting the string.
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', `n` is incremented.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, `ans` is incremented by `n + 1`.
   - This logic is intended to calculate the cost of sorting the string by performing cyclic shifts. However, the logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where the string is already sorted or where the '0's and '1's are interspersed in a way that requires fewer operations.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the calculated cost `ans` for each test case.
   - This part is correct, but the cost calculation logic is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**

The program has two main issues:
- **Incorrect Input Handling**: The use of `input().split()` is incorrect for reading a binary string.
- **Flawed Cost Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the cost does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the string is already sorted or when the '0's and '1's are interspersed in a way that requires fewer operations.

To fix these issues, the input handling should be changed to read the string directly, and the cost calculation logic should be revised to correctly determine the minimum cost to sort the string.
