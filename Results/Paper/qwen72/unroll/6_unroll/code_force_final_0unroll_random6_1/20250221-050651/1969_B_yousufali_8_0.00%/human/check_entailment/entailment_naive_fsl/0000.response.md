Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the input and output requirements as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` reads the string `s` as a list of integers using `input().split()`, which is incorrect because the input is a binary string, not a list of integers. Additionally, the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the string is already sorted, and it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
10
0000
11000
101011
01101001
```

The expected output is:
```
2
0
9
5
11
```

However, the program will fail to produce the correct output because it incorrectly parses the input and does not implement the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the string. The function `func_1` should instead read the input as a string and correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the string.
