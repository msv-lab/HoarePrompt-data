Functionality: ** The function reads a binary string from the input, converts it into a list of integers, and calculates a cost based on the number of '1's and the positions of '0's in the string. It prints the calculated cost, which is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' that follows at least one '1', where `n` is the number of '1's encountered so far. The function does not return any value. **
