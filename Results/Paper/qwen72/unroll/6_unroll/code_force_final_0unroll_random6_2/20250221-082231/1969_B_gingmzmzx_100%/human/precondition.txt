The function `main` does not take any parameters, but it is expected to read input from stdin. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains a binary string s (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}) that needs to be sorted. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
