The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and a string s of length n, where s consists of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
