You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is not used in the function) and a string `s`. It then calculates the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in `s`, and prints the result of `x + y - z`, where `x` is the count of 'map', `y` is the count of 'pie', and `z` is the count of 'mapie'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the printed output will contain `t` lines, each corresponding to the result for a test case. The variables `a` and `s` are updated for each test case, but they do not persist outside the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to ensure it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - If the string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain "pie" or "map"), the output should be 0.
   - The program should handle multiple test cases.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `a` and the string `s`.
   - It then counts the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the string `s`.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie" minus the count of "mapie".

3. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie".
   - For example, if the string is "mappie", it contains both "map" and "pie" but removing just one character (the 'p' in the middle) can make the string beautiful.
   - The program does not consider the minimum number of deletions required to remove all instances of "map" and "pie".

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify and remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate all occurrences of "map" and "pie".
   - One way to do this is to iterate through the string and count the number of characters that need to be removed to break any "map" or "pie" substrings.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle overlapping substrings and does not compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
