You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)



- Annotated Code: 
import  math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
    #State: The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `T` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop has executed. For each iteration of the loop, the value of `suma` is calculated and printed, but `suma` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. Therefore, the final value of `suma` after the loop finishes is 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The main issue lies in the calculation of the variable `x` and the subsequent conditions used to update `suma`. The logic used to determine the number of valid pairs is flawed. Specifically:

1. The calculation of `x`:
   ```python
   x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
   ```
   This formula is not derived from the problem statement and does not correctly count the valid pairs.

2. The condition:
   ```python
   if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
       suma += x
       if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
           suma += 1
   ```
   This condition is also not correct and does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. The final adjustment:
   ```python
   print(suma - 2)
   ```
   Subtracting 2 from `suma` is not justified by the problem statement and can lead to incorrect results.

To verify the correctness, let's consider a simple test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\).

**Actual Output:**
The program will produce an incorrect result because the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
