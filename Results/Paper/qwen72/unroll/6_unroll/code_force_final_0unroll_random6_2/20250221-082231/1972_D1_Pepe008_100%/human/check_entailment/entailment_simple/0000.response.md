### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input.

2. **Loop for `b`**: The program iterates over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `b` (inclusive). This is correct because the problem requires checking all pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= b <= m`.

3. **Calculation of `x`**: The program calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. This formula is derived from the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the formula itself is not straightforward and needs careful examination.

4. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `x` is greater than 0 and adds it to `suma`. This is correct because `x` represents the number of valid `a` values for a given `b` that satisfy the condition.

5. **Additional Check**: The program also checks if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`. If both conditions are true, it adds 1 to `suma`. This additional check is intended to handle edge cases, but it seems to be unnecessary and might be incorrect.

6. **Output**: The program prints `suma - 2` for each test case. This subtraction of 2 is not justified in the problem statement and seems to be an error.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is derived from the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, this formula is not correct for the given problem. The correct approach should involve checking the condition directly for each pair `(a, b)`.

### Correct Approach:
- For each pair `(a, b)`, the condition `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` should be checked directly. This can be done using the following steps:
  1. Calculate `gcd(a, b)`.
  2. Check if `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.
  3. If the condition is satisfied, increment the count.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is flawed, and the formula used to calculate `x` is not correct. Additionally, the subtraction of 2 from `suma` is not justified. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
