Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the provided program and analyze its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Calculation of `suma`**:
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0 for each test case.
   - It then iterates over all possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates \(x\) as \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - It checks if \(x\) is greater than 0 and adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - It also checks if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \mod i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \mod i^2 == 0\) and adds 1 to `suma` if both conditions are true.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints `suma - 2` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\)**:
   - The calculation \(x = (a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is not directly related to the problem's requirement.
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not correctly implemented.

2. **Incorrect Conditions**:
   - The conditions \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \mod i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \mod i^2 == 0\) do not reflect the problem's requirement.
   - The problem requires \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the program is checking something else entirely.

3. **Subtraction of 2**:
   - The final step of subtracting 2 from `suma` is not justified by the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) and \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each pair \((a, b)\), calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs and print the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The conditions and calculations used in the program do not align with the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
