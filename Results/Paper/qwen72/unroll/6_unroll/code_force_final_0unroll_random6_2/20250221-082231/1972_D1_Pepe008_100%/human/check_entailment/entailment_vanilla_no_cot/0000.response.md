Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and calculating a value \(x\) based on a formula, but this formula and the logic around it are not aligned with the problem statement.

The problem requires finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the program's logic is not correctly checking this condition. Instead, it is using a formula that does not directly relate to the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Pair Checking**: For each test case, it iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
3. **Condition Check**: It checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) using the modulo operation.
4. **Counting Valid Pairs**: If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count of valid pairs.
5. **Output**: After processing all pairs for a test case, it prints the count of valid pairs.

This approach correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. However, it may not be efficient enough for large values of \(n\) and \(m\) (up to \(2 \cdot 10^6\)). For such large inputs, a more optimized approach would be necessary to avoid time limits.
