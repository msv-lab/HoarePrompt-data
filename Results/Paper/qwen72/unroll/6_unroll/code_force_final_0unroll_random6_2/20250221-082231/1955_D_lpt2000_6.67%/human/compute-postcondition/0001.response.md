The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `nabors`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nabors`. If `nabors` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop to iterate over the range of `nabors`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `nabors` must be greater than 0.

State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop**
