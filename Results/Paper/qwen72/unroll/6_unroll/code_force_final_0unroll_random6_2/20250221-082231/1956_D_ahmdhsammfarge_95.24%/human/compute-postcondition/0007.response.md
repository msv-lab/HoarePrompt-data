Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing an operation, and the last two elements of `ops` are `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` remains 0, `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`.**
