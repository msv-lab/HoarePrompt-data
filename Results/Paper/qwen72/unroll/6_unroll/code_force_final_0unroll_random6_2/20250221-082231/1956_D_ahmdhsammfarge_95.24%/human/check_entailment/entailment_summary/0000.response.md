### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves selecting a sublist, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the sublist to this MEX value.
   - MEX is defined as the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sublist.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:**
     - This function identifies the optimal sublist to maximize the sum of the array after the operation.
     - It calculates the sum of elements outside the sublist plus the square of the length of the sublist.
     - The function returns the indices of the optimal sublist.
   - **func_2:**
     - This function recursively appends operations to the `ops` list to ensure that the sublist is processed multiple times.
     - It is used to generate a sequence of operations that will set the elements in the sublist to the MEX value.
   - **func_3:**
     - This function performs the operation on the identified sublist.
     - It appends the operation to the `ops` list and updates the sublist with the MEX value.
     - The MEX value is determined by the length of the sublist, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sublist.

3. **Program Flow:**
   - The main program reads the input, initializes the list `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
   - It calls `func_1` to find the optimal sublist.
   - It enters a loop to repeatedly apply the operation using `func_3` until no further operations can be performed.
   - After the loop, it handles any remaining zeros in the list by setting them to 1 and appending the corresponding operations to `ops`.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - **func_1:**
     - The function correctly identifies the optimal sublist to maximize the sum.
     - The logic for calculating the sum and determining the optimal indices is sound.
   - **func_2:**
     - The function generates the necessary operations to set the elements in the sublist to the MEX value.
     - The recursive nature ensures that the operation is applied multiple times, which is required to achieve the maximum sum.
   - **func_3:**
     - The function correctly updates the sublist and appends the operations to `ops`.
     - It ensures that the MEX value is correctly set to the length of the sublist, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sublist.
   - **Main Program:**
     - The main program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
     - It iterates to find and apply the optimal operations.
     - It handles the remaining zeros in the list, ensuring that the maximum sum is achieved.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies and applies the optimal operations to maximize the sum of the array elements, and it handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
