Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing operations that set a subarray to its MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**:
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray to perform the MEX operation on.
   - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is set to its MEX.
   - The MEX of a subarray is approximated by \((j - i + 1) ** 2\), which is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The function returns the indices of the subarray that would maximize the sum.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The annotation correctly states that `r` and `l` are the indices of the sublist such that the sum of the elements outside this sublist plus the square of the length of the sublist is maximized. However, this approximation of MEX is flawed and does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**:
   - This function recursively adds operations to the list `ops` to set the subarray from `r` to `l` to the MEX value.
   - It does this by repeatedly calling itself with a smaller subarray and appending the operation to `ops`.
   - The function does not actually compute the MEX value, which is a critical part of the problem.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The annotation correctly describes the recursive nature of the function and the operations it appends to `ops`. However, it fails to address the lack of MEX computation, which is a significant issue.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**:
   - This function performs the operation on the subarray from `r` to `l` and updates the list `ops` with the operations.
   - It appends the operation to `ops` and checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0. If it is, it appends the operation again.
   - It then appends another operation and recursively calls `func_2` to set the subarray to the MEX value.
   - Finally, it updates the subarray in `lst` to the MEX value, which is the length of the subarray.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The annotation correctly describes the operations appended to `ops` and the update to the sublist in `lst`. However, it does not address the incorrect MEX value being used, which is a critical flaw.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - **MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation in `func_1` is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not \((j - i + 1) ** 2\).
   - **Operation Sequence**: The sequence of operations in `func_2` and `func_3` is not optimal and does not correctly handle the MEX value.
   - **Sum Maximization**: The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the array elements because it uses an incorrect MEX value and does not ensure that the operations are performed optimally.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
