Postcondition: **lst is a list of integers, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), ops is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing an operation, and the last element of ops is [r + 1, l + 1]. Additionally, the minimum value in the sublist lst[r:l + 1] is 0.**
