The code appends the list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. This means that the last element of `ops` is now `[r + 1, l + 1]`, and the second-to-last element of `ops` is also `[r + 1, l + 1]` (as it was before the append operation). The values of `lst`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing an operation, and the last two elements of `ops` are `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` remains 0.**
