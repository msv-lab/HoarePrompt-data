Output State: **lst is a list of integers, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), ops is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing an operation, and the last element of ops is [r + 1, l + 1]. The minimum value in the sublist lst[r:l + 1] remains 0, and the second-to-last element of ops is [r + 1, l + 1].**

Explanation:
- The code `ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])` appends a new list `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the `ops` list.
- The initial state specifies that the last element of `ops` is `[r + 1, l + 1]`.
- After appending `[r + 1, r + 1]`, the last element of `ops` is now `[r + 1, r + 1]`, and the second-to-last element is `[r + 1, l + 1]`.
- The values of `lst`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The condition that the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` remains 0 is still valid.
