Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **MEX Calculation Missing**:
   - The problem description clearly states that the MEX of a chosen subarray should be computed and used to update the elements of the subarray.
   - However, the provided program does not calculate the MEX at any point. Instead, it uses a heuristic to replace the subarray with a value that is the square of its length, which is not the correct approach.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
   - In `func_1`, the program calculates the sum of the array after replacing a subarray with a square of its length. This is not the correct way to maximize the sum using the MEX operation.
   - The correct approach would be to compute the MEX of the subarray and then replace the subarray with this MEX value to see if it increases the sum.

3. **Recursive Function Issues**:
   - The functions `func_2` and `func_3` are recursive and seem to be attempting to apply the MEX operation, but they do not correctly handle the MEX calculation or the array updates.
   - `func_2` appends operations to the `ops` list but does not update the array or calculate the MEX.
   - `func_3` also appends operations to the `ops` list but does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. It updates the subarray with the length of the subarray, which is not the MEX.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not output the maximum sum and the number of operations as required by the problem description.
   - The output format is incorrect, and the program will likely produce an incorrect sum and an incorrect sequence of operations.

**Example Case**:
- For the input:
  ```
  4
  1 100 2 1
  ```
  The expected output is:
  ```
  105 2
  3 3
  3 4
  ```
  However, the provided program will not produce this output because it does not correctly calculate the MEX and apply the operations as described. The program will likely produce an incorrect sum and an incorrect sequence of operations.

**Conclusion**:
- The program fails to implement the MEX operation correctly.
- The sum calculation and the sequence of operations are incorrect.
- The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
