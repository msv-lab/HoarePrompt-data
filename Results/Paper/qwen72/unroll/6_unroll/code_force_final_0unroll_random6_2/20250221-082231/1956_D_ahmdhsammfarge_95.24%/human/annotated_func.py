    #The program returns the indices `r` and `l` of the sublist of `lst` such that the sum of the elements outside this sublist plus the square of the length of the sublist is maximized.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns a tuple `(r, l)` representing the start and end indices of a sublist within `lst`. This sublist is chosen such that the sum of the elements outside the sublist plus the square of the length of the sublist is maximized. The function ensures that `r` and `l` are the indices that achieve this maximum sum, and `over_sum` holds the maximum value of this sum.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < n, and ops is a list that will store the operations as pairs of integers [l, r].

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `r` and `l` where `0 <= r <= l < n`, and a list `ops`. It modifies the `ops` list by appending pairs of integers `[r + 1, l + 1]` in a recursive manner. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `ops` list contains multiple pairs of integers `[r + 1, l + 1]` for each recursive call, with the number of pairs depending on the initial values of `r` and `l`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), and ops is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing an operation.

If the minimum value in the sublist lst[r:l + 1] is 0, then the minimum value in the sublist lst[r:l + 1] remains 0.

    #The program returns the list `lst` where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` has been updated to contain the value `n` (which is equal to `l - r + 1`) for all indices from `r` to `l` inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the list `ops` by appending several lists of integers to it, and updates the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` to contain the value `n` (which is equal to `l - r + 1`) for all indices from `r` to `l` inclusive. The function returns the modified list `lst`.
