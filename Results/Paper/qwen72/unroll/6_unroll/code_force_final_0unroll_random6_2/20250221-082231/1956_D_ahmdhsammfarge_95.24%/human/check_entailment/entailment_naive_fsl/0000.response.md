Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly implement the described algorithm to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` using the MEX operation. Here are the issues:

1. **MEX Calculation Missing**: The program does not calculate the MEX of the chosen subarray. The MEX is a crucial part of the operation, and without it, the program cannot perform the required transformation.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the sum of the array after replacing a subarray with a square of its length, which is not the correct way to maximize the sum using the MEX operation.

3. **Recursive Function Issues**: The functions `func_2` and `func_3` are recursive and seem to be attempting to apply the MEX operation, but they do not correctly handle the MEX calculation or the array updates.

4. **Output Format**: The program does not output the maximum sum and the number of operations as required by the problem description. It also does not output the sequence of operations.

**Example Case:**

For the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the provided program will not produce this output because it does not correctly calculate the MEX and apply the operations as described. The program will likely produce an incorrect sum and an incorrect sequence of operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
