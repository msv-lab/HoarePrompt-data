You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

    #The program returns the indices `r` and `l` of the sublist of `lst` such that the sum of the elements outside this sublist plus the square of the length of the sublist is maximized.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns a tuple `(r, l)` representing the start and end indices of a sublist within `lst`. This sublist is chosen such that the sum of the elements outside the sublist plus the square of the length of the sublist is maximized. The function ensures that `r` and `l` are the indices that achieve this maximum sum, and `over_sum` holds the maximum value of this sum.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < n, and ops is a list that will store the operations as pairs of integers [l, r].

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `r` and `l` where `0 <= r <= l < n`, and a list `ops`. It modifies the `ops` list by appending pairs of integers `[r + 1, l + 1]` in a recursive manner. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `ops` list contains multiple pairs of integers `[r + 1, l + 1]` for each recursive call, with the number of pairs depending on the initial values of `r` and `l`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the list `ops` by appending several lists of integers to it, and updates the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` to contain the value `n` (which is equal to `l - r + 1`) for all indices from `r` to `l` inclusive. The function returns the modified list `lst`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of integers and we can perform an operation that sets a subarray to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements using no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) operations.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**:
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray to perform the MEX operation on.
   - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is set to its MEX.
   - The MEX of a subarray is approximated by \((j - i + 1) ** 2\), which is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The function returns the indices of the subarray that would maximize the sum.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**:
   - This function recursively adds operations to the list `ops` to set the subarray from `r` to `l` to the MEX value.
   - It does this by repeatedly calling itself with a smaller subarray and appending the operation to `ops`.
   - The function does not actually compute the MEX value, which is a critical part of the problem.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**:
   - This function performs the operation on the subarray from `r` to `l` and updates the list `ops` with the operations.
   - It appends the operation to `ops` and checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0. If it is, it appends the operation again.
   - It then appends another operation and recursively calls `func_2` to set the subarray to the MEX value.
   - Finally, it updates the subarray in `lst` to the MEX value, which is the length of the subarray.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - **MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation in `func_1` is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not \((j - i + 1) ** 2\).
   - **Operation Sequence**: The sequence of operations in `func_2` and `func_3` is not optimal and does not correctly handle the MEX value.
   - **Sum Maximization**: The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the array elements because it uses an incorrect MEX value and does not ensure that the operations are performed optimally.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
