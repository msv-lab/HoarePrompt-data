Precondition: **The function should accept an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) representing the number of increasing subsequences required. The function should return or print the length of the array n and the array itself for each test case, or -1 if no such array exists.**
