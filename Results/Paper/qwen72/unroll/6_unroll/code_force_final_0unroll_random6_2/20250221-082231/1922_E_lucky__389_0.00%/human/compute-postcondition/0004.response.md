To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `x != 0`. The current state indicates that `x` is an input integer minus 1. For the loop to execute, `x` must not be equal to 0.

Let's break it down:
- `x` is an input integer minus 1. This means that if the input integer is 1, `x` would be 0, and the loop would not execute.
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `x` must be any integer except 0.

Given that `x` is derived from an input integer, we can adjust the state to ensure that the input integer is not 1, so that `x` is not 0.

State: **`x` is an input integer minus 1, where the input integer is not 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `X` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0**
