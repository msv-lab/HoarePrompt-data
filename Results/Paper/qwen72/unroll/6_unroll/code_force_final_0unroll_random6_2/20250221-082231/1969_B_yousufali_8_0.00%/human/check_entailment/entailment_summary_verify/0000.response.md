### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input using `list(map(int, input().split()))`. This is incorrect because the input is a binary string, not a list of integers. The `input().split()` will split the string into a list of substrings, and `map(int, ...)` will attempt to convert these substrings into integers, which is not the intended behavior. The correct way to read the input string is simply `input()`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function iterates through the string and counts the number of 1s (`n`). It then adds `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`) whenever it encounters a 0 and `n` is not zero. This approach does not correctly handle the cyclic shifts required to sort the string.
   - The correct approach should consider the number of transitions from 1 to 0 and from 0 to 1. The minimum cost to sort the string is the length of the string minus the length of the longest contiguous segment of the same character (either 0s or 1s).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. For example, for the input "0000", the function should output 0, but it will not because it does not correctly identify that no operations are needed.
   - The function also does not handle the case where the string is a single segment of 1s followed by 0s or vice versa. For example, for the input "11000", the function should output 3 (the length of the string minus the length of the longest segment of 1s), but it will not because it does not correctly identify the longest segment.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall program will not produce the correct output.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect due to the issues in input handling and the flawed logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

Final: **False**
