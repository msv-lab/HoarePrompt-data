### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.
   - The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve the sorted string.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function reads a binary string from the input, converts it to a list of integers, and calculates the cost to sort the string.
     - It iterates through the string, counting the number of consecutive 1s (`n`), and adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`) whenever a 0 is encountered after a sequence of 1s.
     - The function then prints the total cost.
     - The logic of adding `n + 1` to the cost for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0 is based on the idea that to move a sequence of 1s to the end of the string, you need to perform a cyclic shift of length `n + 1` for each 0 encountered.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
     - It then calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - The function ensures that the program handles multiple test cases as required by the problem.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies sequences of 1s followed by 0s and calculates the cost to move these sequences to the end of the string.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. In such cases, the cost should be 0, but the function might still add unnecessary costs if it encounters 0s after 1s.
   - Additionally, the function does not account for the possibility of a 1 at the end of the string, which should not contribute to the cost if the string is already sorted.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The main issue lies in `func_1`, which does not correctly handle the case where the string is already sorted or the edge case where a 1 is at the end of the string.
   - For example, for the input `11000`, the function will incorrectly calculate the cost as 9, but the correct cost should be 3 (since you only need to shift the first three characters once).

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly handle all edge cases and may calculate incorrect costs for certain inputs.
