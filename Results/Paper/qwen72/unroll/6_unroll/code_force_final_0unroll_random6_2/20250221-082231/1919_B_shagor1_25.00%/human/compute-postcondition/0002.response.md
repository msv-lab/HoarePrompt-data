Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) and a string s (s_i ∈ {'+', '-'} and |s| = n) representing the length and content of the string for each test case. The variable `s` is assigned the value of an input string, and `neg` is 0.**
