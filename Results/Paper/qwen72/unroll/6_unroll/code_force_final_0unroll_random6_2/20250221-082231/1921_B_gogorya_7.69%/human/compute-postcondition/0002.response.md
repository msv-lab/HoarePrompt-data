Output State: **For each iteration of the loop, the variable `res` is calculated and printed. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, and `hd` are not retained as they are re-initialized in each iteration. The only persistent state is the sequence of printed values of `res` for each test case.**
