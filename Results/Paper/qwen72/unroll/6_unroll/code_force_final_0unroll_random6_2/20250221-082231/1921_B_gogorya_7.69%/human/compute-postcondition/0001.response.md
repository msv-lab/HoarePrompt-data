The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a common placeholder used in Python to indicate that the loop variable is not actually used within the loop body. Before the loop starts, `_` is not initialized, but it will be initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function during the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0**
