Output State: **new_arr is a list of non-negative integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of elements in cur_arr up to the point where the bit-th bit of the cumulative XOR is 0, xor is 0, thing1 is -1, and the bit-th bit of the current value of xor is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `thing1` is updated from 0 to -1.
- The other variables (`new_arr`, `xor`, and the condition about the bit-th bit of the cumulative XOR) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment to `thing1`.
