You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr, x):

    return find_max(arr, 31)

#Function 2:
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
    else:
        return thing1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `find_max` accepts a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and a non-negative integer `bit` (0 <= bit < 30). It returns the length of `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1. Otherwise, it processes `cur_arr` to create a new list `new_arr` containing cumulative XOR values of elements in `cur_arr` up to the point where the bit-th bit of the cumulative XOR is 0. If the bit-th bit of the final cumulative XOR is 1, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`. If the bit-th bit of the final cumulative XOR is 0, it returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`. If `new_arr` is empty and the bit-th bit of the final cumulative XOR is 0, it returns -1.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of segments `[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_k, r_k]` such that:
     - `l_1 = 1` and `r_k = n`.
     - `l_i <= r_i` for all `i` from 1 to `k`.
     - `r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1}` for all `i` from 1 to `k - 1`.
     - The bitwise OR of the XOR results of each segment is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(arr, x)`**:
     - This function simply calls `find_max(arr, 31)`.
     - The choice of `31` is because the problem specifies that `0 <= x < 2^30`, so the highest bit to consider is the 30th bit (0-indexed).

   - **`find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
     - This function is a recursive function that processes the array `cur_arr` bit by bit, starting from the highest bit (31).
     - **Base Case**:
       - If `bit == -1`, it returns the length of `cur_arr`. This means all bits have been processed, and the number of valid segments is the length of the current array.
     - **Recursive Case**:
       - It initializes `new_arr` to store the XOR results of segments that do not set the current bit.
       - It initializes `xor` to 0 and `thing1` to 0.
       - It iterates through each element `i` in `cur_arr`:
         - It updates `xor` with the current element using the XOR operation.
         - If the current bit of `xor` is not set (i.e., `xor >> bit & 1` is 0), it appends `xor` to `new_arr` and resets `xor` to 0.
       - After the loop, if the current bit of `xor` is set, it sets `thing1` to -1 (indicating no valid segments can be formed).
       - If the current bit of `xor` is not set, it recursively calls `find_max` on `new_arr` with the next bit (`bit - 1`).
       - If the current bit of `x` is set, it returns the maximum of:
         - The result of calling `find_max` on `cur_arr` with the next bit (`bit - 1`).
         - The length of `new_arr`.
       - If the current bit of `x` is not set, it returns `thing1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `find_max` processes the array bit by bit, which is a valid approach for this problem.
   - It correctly handles the base case when all bits have been processed.
   - It correctly identifies segments where the current bit is not set and forms a new array of these segments.
   - It correctly handles the case where the current bit of `x` is set by considering both the current array and the new array of segments.
   - It correctly handles the case where the current bit of `x` is not set by returning the result of the new array of segments or -1 if no valid segments can be formed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should handle cases where `x` is 0 and the array elements are all 0.
   - The function should handle cases where `x` is 0 and the array elements are not all 0, returning -1.
   - The function should handle cases where `x` is a large number and the array elements are such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of segments is less than or equal to `x`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples.
