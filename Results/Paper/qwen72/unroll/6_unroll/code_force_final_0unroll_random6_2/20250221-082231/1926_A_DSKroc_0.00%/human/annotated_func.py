#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any explicit input parameters. However, it is expected to read from standard input a series of test cases, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be unchanged, and for each test case, the variables `ac` and `bc` will contain the counts of 'A' and 'B' characters, respectively, in the string `s` that was input for that test case. Each iteration of the loop will reset `ac` and `bc` to 0 for the next test case. The final state of `ac` and `bc` will be the counts for the last test case. The variable `s` will contain the last string input. 
    #
    #In natural language: The loop will have processed `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have counted the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the input string `s`. After all iterations, `t` will still be the same, `ac` and `bc` will hold the counts of 'A' and 'B' for the last test case, and `s` will be the last string that was input.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *The loop will have processed `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have counted the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the input string `s`. After all iterations, `t` will still be the same, `ac` and `bc` will hold the counts of 'A' and 'B' for the last test case, and `s` will be the last string that was input. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the condition `ac > bc` holds. Otherwise, the count of 'A' characters (`ac`) is less than or equal to the count of 'B' characters (`bc`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases from standard input. The first line of input is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains a distinct string of length 5 with letters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, the function counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the string. After processing all test cases, the function prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters in the last test case, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value.
