Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the list of multipliers `a`.

2. **LCM Calculation**: The function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `a` using the `lcm` helper function. The LCM is calculated by iteratively computing the LCM of the current product and the next element in the list, using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.

3. **Betting Strategy**: The function then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier. This ensures that the bet on each outcome is a multiple of the other multipliers, which is a valid approach to ensure that the total sum of bets is less than the return for any winning outcome.

4. **Sum Check**: The function sums up the calculated bets and checks if this sum is strictly less than the LCM. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1` because it means there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

5. **Output**: If the sum is less than the LCM, the function prints the list of bets as a space-separated string.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases where the multipliers are all the same (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`), and it prints `-1` when the sum of bets is not strictly less than the LCM.

7. **Constraints**: The function adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description, ensuring that the bets are integers and within the specified range.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
