### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, if it wins, we receive `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)` for all `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - The condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` can be rewritten as `sum(x_i) < x_i * k_i`.
   - This implies that `sum(x_i) / x_i < k_i` for all `i`.
   - To satisfy this for all `i`, we need to find a set of `x_i` values such that the sum of all `x_i` is less than the smallest `k_i * x_i`.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i`.
   - It then sets each `x_i` to `LCM / k_i`.
   - The sum of all `x_i` is calculated.
   - If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, the program outputs `-1` indicating no valid solution.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the `x_i` values.

4. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the numbers in the set.
   - By setting `x_i` to `LCM / k_i`, we ensure that `k_i * x_i` is equal to the LCM for each `i`.
   - This means that for each outcome `i`, the amount received back is the same, which is the LCM.

5. **Sum of Bets:**
   - The sum of all `x_i` values is `sum(LCM / k_i)`.
   - If this sum is less than the LCM, the condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` is satisfied for all `i`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all `k_i` values are the same, the sum of `x_i` will be `n * (LCM / k_i)`.
   - For the condition to hold, `n * (LCM / k_i) < LCM`, which simplifies to `n < k_i`.
   - If `n >= k_i` for any `i`, there is no valid solution, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.

7. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers.
   - It then sets each `x_i` to `LCM / k_i` and calculates the sum.
   - The program checks if the sum is less than the LCM and outputs the result accordingly.

### Correctness:
The program follows the correct logic and handles the edge cases appropriately. It ensures that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, which is the LCM of the multipliers.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
