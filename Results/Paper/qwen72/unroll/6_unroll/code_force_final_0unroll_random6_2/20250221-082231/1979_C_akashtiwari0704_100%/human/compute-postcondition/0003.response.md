The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of integers `k` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) of length `n` representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. The function returns a list of integers `x` of length `n` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, or -1 if no such distribution is possible.
