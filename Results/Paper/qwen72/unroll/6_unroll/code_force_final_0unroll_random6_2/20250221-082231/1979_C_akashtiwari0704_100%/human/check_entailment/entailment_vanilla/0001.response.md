### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, the amount received back is \(k_i \times x_i\), where \(x_i\) is the bet on outcome \(i\).
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Approach:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - It then sets \(x_i = \text{LCM} / k_i\) for each outcome \(i\).
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - If \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \geq \text{LCM}\), it prints \(-1\) indicating no valid distribution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are integers and that the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) is checked.
   - The program correctly calculates the LCM using the `gcd` function.
   - The bets are calculated as \(x_i = \text{LCM} / k_i\), which ensures that \(k_i \times x_i = \text{LCM}\) for each \(i\).
   - The sum of the bets \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\) is compared to the LCM to check if the condition is met.
   - If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints \(-1\), which is correct because it means there is no valid distribution.
   - If the sum is less than the LCM, it prints the bets, which is also correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the sum of bets is equal to the LCM by printing \(-1\), which is correct.
   - The program also handles the case where the multipliers are all the same (e.g., \(k_1 = k_2 = \ldots = k_n\)) by correctly printing \(-1\) when the sum of bets equals the LCM.

5. **Constraints:**
   - The program ensures that the bets \(x_i\) are integers and within the range \(1 \le x_i \le 10^9\), which is valid as per the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets and checks the condition as required by the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
