Reasoning:  
The logic of the program is based on the parity of the number of coins and the relative values of `a` and `b`. However, the program contains a few logical errors that do not align with the optimal play strategy described in the problem:

1. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - If `a == b`, the program correctly prints 'Bob'. This is because if both players have the same number of coins, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, and Alice will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.

2. **Special Case for `a == 1`**:
   - The program prints 'Alice' if `a == 1`. This is incorrect. If Alice has 1 coin, she cannot make a move (since she must remove 1 coin and cannot have 0 coins before doing so), and Bob wins immediately.

3. **Special Case for `b == 1`**:
   - The program prints 'Bob' if `b == 1`. This is incorrect. If Bob has 1 coin, Alice can swap wallets with Bob, and then Bob will be the one who cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

4. **Parity Check**:
   - The program prints 'Bob' if `a` is odd. This is incorrect. The parity of `a` alone does not determine the winner. The game is more complex and depends on the relative values of `a` and `b`.

5. **Parity and Relative Values**:
   - The program prints 'Alice' if `a` is even and `b` is odd. This is incorrect. The parity of `a` and `b` alone does not determine the winner. The game depends on the sequence of moves and the ability to force the opponent into a losing position.

6. **Relative Values**:
   - The program prints 'Bob' if `a > b`. This is incorrect. The relative values of `a` and `b` alone do not determine the winner. The game depends on the sequence of moves and the ability to force the opponent into a losing position.
   - The program prints 'Alice' otherwise. This is also incorrect for the same reason.

The correct approach to determine the winner is to consider the game as a combinatorial game where the player with the higher number of coins can always force the opponent into a losing position. The key insight is that if the number of coins in both wallets is the same, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and win. If the number of coins is different, the player with more coins can always force the other player into a position where they have fewer coins and eventually win.

Here is the correct logic:
- If `a == b`, Bob wins.
- If `a > b`, Alice wins.
- If `a < b`, Bob wins.

However, the program does not follow this correct logic. It has several incorrect conditions that do not align with the optimal play strategy.

Correctness: **False**
