### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a list of slimes with sizes, and each second, a slime can eat its neighbor if it is strictly larger. The goal is to determine the minimum time each slime can be eaten, or report -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function is used to find the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. It returns the index plus 1 if `x` is found, or the index itself if `x` is not found. This function is used to determine the position of a potential eater slime.
   - **func_2**: This function processes the list `a` to determine the minimum time each slime can be eaten. It uses a cumulative sum list `left` and a `last` list to keep track of the last occurrence of a different element. The function updates the `ans` list based on the conditions:
     - If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, the slime at index `i` can be eaten immediately (in 1 second).
     - Otherwise, it calculates the cumulative sum up to `i` and uses `func_1` to find the potential eater slime. It then updates `ans[i]` based on the minimum time calculated.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads multiple test cases and processes each one using `func_2` and its reverse. It then combines the results to find the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.
   - The combination step ensures that the minimum time is taken from either the forward or backward processing, or -1 if it is impossible for the slime to be eaten in either direction.

4. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - The program handles the case where a slime cannot be eaten by setting `ans[i]` to -1.
   - The cumulative sum and `last` list are used to efficiently find the potential eater slime, which is crucial for the correctness of the program.
   - The reverse processing ensures that the program considers both left and right neighbors for each slime.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.
   - The use of `func_1` and the cumulative sum list `left` ensures that the program efficiently finds the potential eater slime.
   - The combination of forward and backward processing ensures that the minimum time is accurately determined for each slime.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it meets the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.
