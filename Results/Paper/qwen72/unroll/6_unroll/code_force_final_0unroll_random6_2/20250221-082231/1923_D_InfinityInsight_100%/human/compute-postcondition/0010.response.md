The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `n`. `a` is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 3 * 10^5, and each element in the list is between 1 and 10^9. `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a). The function returns the value of `ans`, which is updated based on certain conditions within the function, while the values of `left` and `last` remain unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns an updated value of `ans` based on conditions within the function, while keeping `left` and `last` unchanged.**
