Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `a` and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element `ans[i]` (for `1 <= i < n`) is updated based on the following conditions: If `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to the difference between `i + 1` and the index of the last occurrence of a different element before `i` in `a`, or -1 if no such element exists. The function maintains the cumulative sum of elements in `a` in a list `left` and the indices of the last occurrence of a different element in a list `last`, but these are not returned. **
