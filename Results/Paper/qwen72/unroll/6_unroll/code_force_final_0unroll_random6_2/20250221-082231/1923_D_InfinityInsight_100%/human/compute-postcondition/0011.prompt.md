You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 3 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. n is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a).
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
        
    #State: `left` is a list containing the integer 0. `last` is a list of length `n` where the first element is -1 and the subsequent elements are the indices of the last occurrence of a different element before the current index in the list `a`. `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to -1.
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
        
    #State: `left` is a list containing the cumulative sum of elements in `a` starting from 0, and `last` and `ans` remain unchanged.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
        
    #State: `left` remains unchanged, `last` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated based on the conditions in the loop.
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of `ans`, which has been updated based on the conditions in the loop, while `left` and `last` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns an updated value of `ans` based on conditions within the function, while keeping `left` and `last` unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `ans`, which has been updated based on the conditions in the loop, while `left` and `last` remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
