The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. For the loop to start, `i` should be 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 3 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= len(a), `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `last` is a list containing the integer -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to -1, `i` is 1**
