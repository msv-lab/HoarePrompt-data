Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - The function processes the operations and builds the array based on the given operations.
   - For operation type 1 (append), it correctly appends the value to the array.
   - For operation type 2 (extend), it duplicates the array by extending it with its current elements. However, this approach is inefficient because it can lead to an array of size up to \(10^{18}\), which is impractical to store in memory.
   - The function then processes the queries by accessing the array at the indices \((k - 1) \% \text{len(array)}\). This is correct because the array is periodic after each extend operation, and the modulo operation ensures that we access the correct element in the repeated pattern.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases, `t`, and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations, `n`, and the number of queries, `q`.
   - It then reads the operations and queries, and calls `func_1` to get the results.
   - The results are printed for each test case.

3. **Efficiency Concern**:
   - The main issue with the program is the efficiency of `func_1`. The extend operation can lead to an array of size up to \(10^{18}\), which is infeasible to store and process.
   - A more efficient approach would be to keep track of the size of the array and the periodic pattern without actually storing the entire array. This can be done using a list to store the lengths of the segments and another list to store the values.

4. **Correctness**:
   - Despite the inefficiency, the logic of the program is correct for small inputs. The operations are processed correctly, and the queries are answered based on the periodic nature of the array.
   - However, for the given constraints (especially \(10^{18}\) elements), the program will fail due to memory and time limitations.

Given the constraints and the inefficiency of the current implementation, the program is not correct for large inputs.

Correctness: **False**
