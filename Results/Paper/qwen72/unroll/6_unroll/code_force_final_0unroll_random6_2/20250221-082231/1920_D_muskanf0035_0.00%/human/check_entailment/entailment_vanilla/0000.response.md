### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to simulate a series of operations on an initially empty array.
   - The operations can either append a single integer to the array or append multiple copies of the current array to itself.
   - After performing all operations, we need to answer multiple queries about the k-th element of the resulting array.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty array `array` and an empty list `result` to store the results of the queries.
   - **Operation Handling**:
     - For `op_type == 1`, the function appends the integer `value` to the array.
     - For `op_type == 2`, the function appends `value` copies of the current array to itself. This is done using a list comprehension that extends the array with `value` copies of its current state.
   - **Query Handling**: After all operations are performed, the function iterates through the queries and appends the k-th element of the array to the `result` list. The k-th element is determined by `(k - 1) % len(array)` to handle the case where the array is repeated multiple times.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - **Reading Operations and Queries**: For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`. It then reads the operations and queries.
   - **Calling Function 1**: It calls `func_1` with the number of operations, the list of operations, and the list of queries.
   - **Output**: It prints the results of the queries for each test case.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Memory and Performance**: The current implementation of `func_1` can be inefficient and memory-intensive, especially for large values of `x` in the second type of operation. For example, if `x` is very large, the array can grow exponentially, leading to performance issues.
   - **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation in the query handling part is correct and ensures that the k-th element is correctly determined even if the array is repeated multiple times.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for handling the operations and queries is correct.
   - However, the implementation is not efficient for large inputs, which could lead to performance issues or memory errors in practical scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the provided implementation, the program is logically correct but may not be efficient for large inputs. However, since the problem description does not explicitly require efficiency, and the program meets the basic requirements, we can consider it correct in a theoretical sense.

Correctness: **True**
