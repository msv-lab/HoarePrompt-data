You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. n and q are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5. operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x, where b is either 1 or 2, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n if b=1, and 1 <= x <= 10^9 if b=2. queries is a list of q integers, each representing a query index k_i such that 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after all operations.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x, where b is either 1 or 2, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n if b=1, and 1 <= x <= 10^9 if b=2, `queries` is a list of q integers, each representing a query index k_i such that 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after all operations. The loop will have printed the results of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` for each test case, and the variables `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` will be reinitialized for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`. It processes a series of operations on an array and returns the results of the queries based on the final state of the array.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
