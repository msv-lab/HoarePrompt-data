Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x, where b is either 1 or 2, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n if b=1, and 1 <= x <= 10^9 if b=2, `queries` is a list of q integers, each representing a query index k_i such that 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after all operations. The loop will have printed the results of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` for each test case, and the variables `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` will be reinitialized for each test case.**
