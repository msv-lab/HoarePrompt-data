t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. n and q are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5. operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x, where b is either 1 or 2, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n if b=1, and 1 <= x <= 10^9 if b=2. queries is a list of q integers, each representing a query index k_i such that 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after all operations.
