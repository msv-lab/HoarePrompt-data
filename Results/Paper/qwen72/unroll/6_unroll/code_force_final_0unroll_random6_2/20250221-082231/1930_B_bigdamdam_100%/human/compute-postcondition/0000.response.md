The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop can execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting point for the `range` function.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
