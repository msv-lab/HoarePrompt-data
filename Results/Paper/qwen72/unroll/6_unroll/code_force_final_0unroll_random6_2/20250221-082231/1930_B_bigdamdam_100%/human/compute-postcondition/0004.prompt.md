You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation p. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: The function `func` will print the permutations for each test case, where each permutation is a sequence of integers from 1 to n rearranged such that the even indices (0-based) contain the largest even numbers in descending order, and the odd indices contain the smallest odd numbers in ascending order. The loop will have completed all iterations, and the variables `i` and `n` will be in their final states after the last test case. The list `p` will be the last permutation generated, and `ind` will be the last value used for filling the permutation. The initial state of the function and the structure of the loop remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation `p`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
