The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer `n` where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of a permutation `p`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function does not explicitly list the parameters in its definition, but based on the context, it is expected to process these test cases and return a result for each one. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the given information.
