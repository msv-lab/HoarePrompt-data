test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), x (an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and y (an integer such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), followed by a list of n integers a (each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
