Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding beautiful pairs in an array based on the given conditions. Let's break down the logic and check if it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Preparation**:
   - The input is read in bulk and split into a list of strings.
   - The number of test cases `t` is extracted from the first element of the list.
   - For each test case, the values `n`, `x`, and `y` are read, followed by the array `arr` of length `n`.
   - These values are stored in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the function `func_1` is called.
   - Inside `func_1`, two dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are initialized to keep track of the counts of elements that satisfy the modulo conditions.
   - The program iterates over each element `num` in the array `arr`.
   - For each element, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`:
     - `mod_x = -num % x` is intended to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `mod_y = num % y` is intended to check if `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - The program then increments the count of beautiful pairs by the number of times `mod_x` and `mod_y` have been seen before in the array.
   - It updates the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the current element's modulo values.

3. **Output**:
   - The results for each test case are collected in the list `results`.
   - The list `results` is printed, with each result corresponding to the number of beautiful pairs in the respective test case.

### Issues and Analysis:
- **Modulo Calculation**:
  - The calculation `mod_x = -num % x` is correct for checking if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` because `-num % x` gives the negative equivalent of `num % x`.
  - The calculation `mod_y = num % y` is correct for checking if `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` because `num % y` gives the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.

- **Counting Pairs**:
  - The program increments the count of beautiful pairs by the number of times `mod_x` and `mod_y` have been seen before. This is incorrect because it does not ensure that the pairs `(i, j)` satisfy both conditions simultaneously.
  - The correct approach would be to check for pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and both conditions are satisfied.

### Correct Approach:
- For each element `num` in the array, we need to check if there exists another element `num2` such that:
  - `(num + num2) % x == 0`
  - `(num - num2) % y == 0`
- This can be done by iterating over the array and for each element, checking all subsequent elements to see if they form a beautiful pair.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs as it does not check the conditions for pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`. Instead, it incorrectly counts the occurrences of individual modulo results.

Correctness: **False**
