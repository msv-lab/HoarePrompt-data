Output State: **The loop will have executed `q` times, and for each iteration, it will have read three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it will have printed either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' to the console. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be in their final state after the last iteration, but their specific values will depend on the last input provided. The variable `i` will have the value `q-1` after the loop finishes. The number of test cases `t` and the input integer `q` will remain unchanged.**
