You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/6b5282a065196a0a0ca650a68a351af816de8549.png)
It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

    #The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been updated based on the smallest element in `min_heap` within a certain range.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers representing river depths, with the first and last elements being 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d < len(row). It updates the list `row` by setting the first element to 1, increasing the elements from index 1 to index d-1 by 2, and then updating the elements from index d to the end based on the smallest element in a min-heap within a certain range. The function returns the last element of the updated list `row`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains four integers n, m, k, and d such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The following n lines each contain m integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last elements of each row being 0.

    #This is printed: - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `costs` and `k` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` (with constraints `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100`, `3 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5`, and `1 ≤ d ≤ m`). The following `n` lines each contain `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last elements of each row being 0. The function processes these depths using the `func_1` function for each row, calculates the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the resulting list of costs, and prints the minimum sum of these `k` consecutive elements. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid `n` and `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It then reads the grid of depths `rows`.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Row:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the minimum cost to install supports for a single row.
   - The function initializes the first cell of the row with a cost of 1 (since the depth is 0 and the cost is `a_{i,1} + 1`).
   - It then iterates through the first `d` cells, setting their costs to `a_{i,j} + 2` (since the cost is `a_{i,j} + 1` and an additional 1 for the support).
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within the last `d` cells.
   - For each subsequent cell, it ensures that the distance between the current cell and the last support is no more than `d` by popping elements from the heap that are too far.
   - It then updates the cost of the current cell by adding the minimum cost from the heap and the cost of the current cell.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell in the row.

3. **Total Cost Calculation for Multiple Rows:**
   - The function `func_2` calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the minimum cost for that row.
   - It then computes the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and appends these costs to `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost from `total_costs`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 1 by simply returning the cost of the single row.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is greater than 1 by considering all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the program efficiently finds the minimum cost for each cell within the distance `d`.
   - The overall complexity is manageable given the constraints, especially since the sum of `n * m` for all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of installing supports for each row and then for the set of `k` consecutive rows.
- The use of the min-heap ensures that the program efficiently handles the constraints and finds the correct minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
