Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` (with constraints `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100`, `3 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5`, and `1 ≤ d ≤ m`). The following `n` lines each contain `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last elements of each row being 0. The function processes these depths using the `func_1` function for each row, calculates the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the resulting list of costs, and prints the minimum sum of these `k` consecutive elements. The function does not return any value. **
