### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
   - Each row must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed d.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell (i, j) is \(a_{i,j} + 1\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single row of the grid.
   - It sets the first element of the row to 1 (since the cost of installing a support in the first column is \(0 + 1 = 1\)).
   - It increases the cost of the first d-1 elements by 2 (since these elements are within the distance d from the first column).
   - It then uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within the range of d.
   - For each element from index d to the end, it updates the cost based on the minimum cost in the heap and adds the new cost to the heap.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the row, which represents the total cost of installing supports for that row.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for a test case.
   - It reads the number of rows (n), columns (m), bridges (k), and maximum distance (d).
   - It reads the grid of river depths.
   - It processes each row using `func_1` to get the cost of installing supports for that row.
   - It then calculates the sum of costs for k consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these sums.

4. **Input and Output**:
   - The input format is correctly handled, and the output is the minimum total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program should handle the input within the given limits.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where k = 1 (i.e., building only one bridge).
   - The program also correctly handles the edge case where d is large enough to cover the entire row (i.e., no additional supports are needed between the first and last columns).

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a min-heap in `func_1` ensures that the function efficiently finds the minimum cost for installing supports within the range of d.
   - The overall complexity of the program is manageable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of the grid. The input and output handling is correct, and the functions work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
