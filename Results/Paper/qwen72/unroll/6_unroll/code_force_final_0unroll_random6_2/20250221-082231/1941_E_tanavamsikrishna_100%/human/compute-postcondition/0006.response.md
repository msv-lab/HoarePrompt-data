To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total_costs` is a list of sums of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`, starting from the first element up to the `(n - k + 1)`-th element.
   - The lengths of `rows`, `costs`, and `total_costs` are `n`, `n`, and `n - k + 1` respectively.
   - All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) remain unchanged.

2. **Understanding `total_costs`:**
   - `total_costs` is constructed by summing `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - For example, if `costs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 3`, then `total_costs` would be `[1+2+3, 2+3+4, 3+4+5] = [6, 9, 12]`.

3. **Finding the Minimum:**
   - The `min(total_costs)` function will return the smallest value in the `total_costs` list.
   - Given the construction of `total_costs`, the minimum value will be the smallest sum of any `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.

Since the exact values of `costs` and `k` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the smallest sum of k consecutive elements in the costs list)**
