Reasoning:

The problem requires us to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. This means for each outcome \(i\), the bet \(x_i\) should satisfy the condition:
\[ \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i \]

To solve this, we need to find a set of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) that meet this condition for all \(i\).

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1(a, b)` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
- This function is used to find the LCM of all elements in the list `vals`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.
- It initializes `den` with the first element of `vals`.
- It iterates through `vals` and updates `den` to be the LCM of `den` and the current element.
- It then calculates `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
- The sum of `vprod` is subtracted from `den` to get a new value of `den`.
- If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` (indicating no valid distribution).
- Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces.

### Correctness Check:
1. **LCM Calculation**:
   - The LCM of all elements in `vals` is calculated to ensure that the bets are integers and meet the required condition.
   - The LCM is used to find a common multiple that can be divided by each \(k_i\) to get an integer bet.

2. **Bet Calculation**:
   - Each bet \(x_i\) is calculated as `den // k_i`.
   - The sum of all bets is `sum(vprod)`.
   - The condition to check if a valid distribution exists is `den - sum(vprod) > 0`.

3. **Condition Verification**:
   - If `den - sum(vprod) <= 0`, it means the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is not strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome, so the function prints `-1`.
   - If `den - sum(vprod) > 0`, the function prints the bets, which should meet the required condition.

### Example Verification:
- For the first test case with `vals = [3, 2, 7]`:
  - `den` is the LCM of 3, 2, and 7, which is 42.
  - `vprod = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`.
  - `sum(vprod) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`.
  - `den - sum(vprod) = 42 - 41 = 1 > 0`.
  - The function prints `14 21 6`, which is a valid solution.

- For the second test case with `vals = [3, 3]`:
  - `den` is the LCM of 3 and 3, which is 3.
  - `vprod = [3 // 3, 3 // 3] = [1, 1]`.
  - `sum(vprod) = 1 + 1 = 2`.
  - `den - sum(vprod) = 3 - 2 = 1 > 0`.
  - The function prints `1 1`, which is a valid solution.

- For the third test case with `vals = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`:
  - `den` is the LCM of 5, 5, 5, 5, and 5, which is 5.
  - `vprod = [5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - `sum(vprod) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
  - `den - sum(vprod) = 5 - 5 = 0 <= 0`.
  - The function prints `-1`, which is correct because there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the bets and checks the condition to ensure a valid distribution of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
