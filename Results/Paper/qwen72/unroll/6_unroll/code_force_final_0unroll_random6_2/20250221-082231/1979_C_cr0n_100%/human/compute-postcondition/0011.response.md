To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `den` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `vals` minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`.
   - `vals` remains unchanged.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of the original `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - `den` is greater than 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `vals` is a list of integers.
   - `den` is the GCD of all elements in `vals` minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is calculated as `den / vals[i]`.

3. **Calculating `vprod`:**
   - Each element in `vprod` is `den / vals[i]`.
   - Since `den` is the GCD of all elements in `vals`, and `den` is greater than 0, each element in `vprod` will be an integer (because the GCD is a divisor of each element in `vals`).

4. **Printing `vprod`:**
   - The `print` statement converts each element in `vprod` to a string and joins them with a space.
   - The output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `vprod`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The elements in `vprod` are calculated as `den / vals[i]` for each `i` in the range of `vals`.
   - Since `den` is the GCD of `vals`, each element in `vprod` will be an integer.

Output: **[den / vals[0]] [den / vals[1]] ... [den / vals[n-1]] (where each element is the result of den divided by the corresponding element in vals, and den is the greatest common divisor of all elements in vals minus the sum of the elements in vprod)**

This output is a space-separated string of the elements in `vprod`, where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
