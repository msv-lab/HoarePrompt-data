### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute a certain number of coins among `n` outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the return from any winning outcome.
   - The return from a winning outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by the corresponding multiplier `k_i`.

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers `k_i` to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that the total bet is a common multiple of all the multipliers.
   - The LCM is used to determine the denominator `den` for the bets.
   - The bet for each outcome is calculated as `den // k_i`, which ensures that the total bet is `den - sum(vprod)`.
   - If the total bet is not less than the LCM, it means there is no valid distribution of coins, and the program outputs `-1`.

3. **Function Breakdown:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the greatest common divisor (GCD). The LCM is calculated as `a * b // gcd(a, b)`.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
     - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier.
     - It iterates through the multipliers and updates `den` to be the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier.
     - It calculates the bet for each outcome as `den // k_i`.
     - It checks if the total bet is less than `den`. If not, it outputs `-1`.
     - If a valid distribution exists, it prints the bets.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **LCM Calculation:** The LCM of the multipliers is correctly calculated using the `func_1` function.
   - **Bet Calculation:** The bets are calculated as `den // k_i`, which ensures that the return from any winning outcome is `k_i * (den // k_i) = den`.
   - **Total Bet Check:** The total bet is `sum(vprod)`, and the program checks if `den - sum(vprod) > 0`. This ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the LCM, which is a valid condition for the problem.
   - **Output:** The program correctly outputs the bets if a valid distribution exists, and `-1` otherwise.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Outcome:** If there is only one outcome, the program will correctly output a bet that satisfies the condition.
   - **Equal Multipliers:** If all multipliers are the same, the program will correctly output `-1` because the total bet will always be equal to the LCM, not less.
   - **Large Multipliers:** The program handles large multipliers by using the LCM, which is a valid approach.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for the outcomes based on the given multipliers and ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return from any winning outcome. The edge cases are also handled correctly.

Correctness: **True**
