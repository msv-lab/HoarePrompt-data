Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. It uses the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \), where GCD is the greatest common divisor.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function handles each test case:
   - It reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the list of multipliers \( \text{vals} \).
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier.
   - It iterates through the list of multipliers and updates `den` to be the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier. This ensures that `den` is the LCM of all multipliers.
   - It calculates the product of `den` divided by each multiplier, resulting in a list `vprod` where each element is the amount of coins to be bet on the corresponding outcome.
   - It computes the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes by summing the elements of `vprod`.
   - It checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than or equal to `den`. If so, it prints `-1` because it means there is no way to distribute the coins as required.
   - If the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than `den`, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

The logic ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for each possible winning outcome, which satisfies the problem's requirements. The constraints are also respected, and the program handles multiple test cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
