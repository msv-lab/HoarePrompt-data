### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
   - We need to perform `k` operations where in each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - The final answer should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes a number and returns its value modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - This is a correct and necessary function for handling large numbers and ensuring the result fits within the required constraints.
   
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - However, there are several issues with this function:
       - The `new_segment` and `max_segment` are initialized as lists, but `new_segment` is only ever a list with two elements, and `max_segment` is a list with a single element.
       - The logic for updating `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the array has negative numbers and positive numbers.
       - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is entirely negative.
       - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is entirely positive.
       - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array has a mix of positive and negative numbers.
       - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is empty.
       - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array has a single element.
     - This function is incorrect and does not solve the problem as intended.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - This function is intended to compute the final answer based on the maximum sum of a subarray and the number of operations.
     - However, the function is incomplete and does not contain any logic to compute the answer.
     - This function is incorrect and does not solve the problem as intended.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach to solve this problem involves finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and then using this sum to maximize the total sum after `k` operations.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is positive, we can repeatedly add this sum to the array to maximize the total sum.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative, the best strategy is to not perform any operations and return the sum of the original array.
   - The final answer should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, and `func_3` is incomplete and does not compute the final answer.

**Correctness: False**
