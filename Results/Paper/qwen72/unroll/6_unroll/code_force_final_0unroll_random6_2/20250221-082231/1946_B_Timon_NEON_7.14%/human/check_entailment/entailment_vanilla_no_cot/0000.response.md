Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incomplete and contains logical errors that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Function 3 is incomplete**: The function `func_3` is supposed to handle the main logic for calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, but it is left with an empty body and an uninitialized `answer` variable. This function needs to be completed to solve the problem.

2. **Function 2 logic is flawed**: The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, but it has several issues:
   - It incorrectly handles the `max_segment` and `new_segment` lists. The `max_segment` list is not properly initialized and is used in a way that does not make sense.
   - The `segments_variants` list is not being used correctly to store the segments.
   - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is incorrect and does not properly handle the transition between positive and negative numbers.

3. **Modulo operation in Function 1**: The function `func_1` correctly applies the modulo operation, but it is not clear how it is being used in the context of the problem. It should be integrated into the main logic to ensure the final answer is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Main logic missing**: There is no main function or loop that reads the input, processes the test cases, and outputs the results. The program needs a main block to handle the input and call the appropriate functions.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to implement a dynamic programming approach or a more efficient algorithm that can handle the constraints and compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_sum_after_k_operations(t, test_cases):
    MOD = 1000000007
    
    def max_subarray_sum(arr):
        max_sum = float('-inf')
        current_sum = 0
        for num in arr:
            current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
        return max_sum
    
    def solve(n, k, arr):
        total_sum = sum(arr)
        max_subarray = max_subarray_sum(arr)
        
        if max_subarray <= 0:
            return total_sum % MOD
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations
        max_sum = total_sum + max_subarray * k
        return max_sum % MOD
    
    results = []
    for n, k, arr in test_cases:
        results.append(solve(n, k, arr))
    
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 12
test_cases = [
    (2, 2, [-4, -7]),
    (3, 3, [2, 2, 8]),
    (1, 7, [7]),
    (5, 1, [4, -2, 8, -12, 9]),
    (7, 4, [8, 14, -9, 6, 0, -1, 3]),
    (7, 100, [5, 3, -8, 12, -5, -9, 3]),
    (6, 1000, [-1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000, -1000000000]),
    (2, 1, [1000000000, 8]),
    (5, 4, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]),
    (6, 10, [48973, 757292, 58277, -38574, 27475, 999984]),
    (7, 1, [-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000, 1000, -1000]),
    (10, 10050, [408293874, -3498597, 7374783, 295774930, -48574034, 26623784, 498754833, -294875830, 283045804, 85938045])
]

results = max_sum_after_k_operations(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version includes a function `max_subarray_sum` to find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm, and a function `solve` to compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations. The main logic reads the test cases and outputs the results.
