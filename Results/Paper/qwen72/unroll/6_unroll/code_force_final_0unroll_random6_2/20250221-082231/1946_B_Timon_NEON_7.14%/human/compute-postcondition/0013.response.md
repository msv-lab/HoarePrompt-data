Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is a list containing the sum of the maximum positive segment and the index of the last element in that segment; `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a positive segment and the indices of the first and last elements in that segment, with an additional list appended that contains the elements of `max_segment` plus the value `len(arr) - 1`, and another list appended that is `new_segment` plus the value `len(arr) - 1`; `max_sum` is -1; `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `total_max_segment = [-1]` directly assigns the list `[-1]` to the variable `total_max_segment`.
- The initial state specified that `total_max_segment` was the list with the highest sum from `segments_variants` and had a length of 1. After the assignment, `total_max_segment` is now `[-1]`, which is a list with a length of 1.
- The values of `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
