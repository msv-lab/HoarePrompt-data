To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object `line` and the list that is being iterated over, which is `[*open(0)][2::2]`.

1. **Understanding the Loop Head**:
   - `[*open(0)]` reads all lines from standard input (file descriptor 0) and converts them into a list.
   - `[2::2]` slices this list starting from the third element (index 2) and takes every second element from there.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most 2 times in the list.
   - The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `[*open(0)][2::2]` must have at least one element.
   - This means that the input must have at least three lines (since the slicing starts from the third line and takes every second line after that).

4. **Final State**:
   - The list `[*open(0)][2::2]` must have at least one element.
   - The first element in this list will be assigned to `line` during the first iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state and the requirements for the loop to execute, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most 2 times in the list, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the input must have at least three lines, `line` is the first element of the list `[*open(0)][2::2]`**.
