Output State: **The values of t, n, and a remain unchanged. The loop iterates through the input lines, processing every third line starting from the third line. For each processed line, it calculates and prints the difference between the number of tokens in the line and the number of unique tokens. The state of t, n, and a is not affected by the loop.**
