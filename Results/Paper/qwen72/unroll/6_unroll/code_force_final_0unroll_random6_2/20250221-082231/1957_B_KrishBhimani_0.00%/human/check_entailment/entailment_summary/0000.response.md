### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Binary Representation Analysis:**
   - The function identifies the positions of 1s in the binary representation of `k` using a while loop and bitwise operations.
   - It appends these positions to the list `arr`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the sequence of integers.
   - It iterates over the positions in `arr` and constructs the sequence by adding powers of 2 corresponding to these positions.
   - If the number of elements in `ans` reaches `n-1`, it appends the remaining value needed to make the sum equal to `k`.
   - If the number of elements in `ans` is less than `n`, it appends zeros to fill the remaining positions.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.

### Evaluation:

- **Sum Condition:**
  - The function ensures that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k` by carefully managing the addition of powers of 2 and the remaining value.
  - This is achieved by appending the remaining value needed to reach `k` when `c` (the count of elements in `ans`) reaches `n-1`.

- **Maximizing the Number of 1s:**
  - The function constructs the sequence using powers of 2, which ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
  - This is because each power of 2 contributes a single 1 in a different position in the binary representation.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the case where `n` is 1 by directly printing `k`.
  - It also handles the case where `n` is greater than the number of 1s in the binary representation of `k` by filling the remaining positions with zeros.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
