The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts multiple test cases, each with two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `t` represents the number of test cases, and each test case has `n` and `k` as integers with specific constraints. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with two integer parameters `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
