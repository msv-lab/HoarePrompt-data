The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it generates an array `ans` of length `n` such that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The elements of `ans` are powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of `k`, and any remaining positions in `ans` are filled with 0s. The function prints the elements of `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are reset for the next call.
