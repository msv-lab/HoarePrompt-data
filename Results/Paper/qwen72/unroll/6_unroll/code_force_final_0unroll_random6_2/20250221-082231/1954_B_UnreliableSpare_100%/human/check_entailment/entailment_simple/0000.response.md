Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case. However, it calls `func_1()` without passing any parameters, which is a mistake since `func_1()` should take the list `a` and the integer `n` as parameters.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined without any parameters. It should be defined to accept `n` and `arr` as parameters. This is a significant issue because the function needs to process these inputs.

3. **Checking for Identical Elements**: The program checks if all elements in the array are identical by setting a `flag` to `True` and iterating through the array. If any two consecutive elements are different, the `flag` is set to `False`. This part is correct and necessary to determine if the array is entirely uniform.

4. **Finding Minimum Consecutive Elements to Remove**: The program then tries to find the minimum number of consecutive elements equal to the first element of the array that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. It uses a variable `ans` initialized to `Decimal('Infinity')` to keep track of the minimum count. This approach is flawed because:
   - It only considers sequences of elements equal to the first element (`arr[0]`), which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - It does not consider sequences of elements that are not equal to the first element but can still be used to make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Output**: The program prints `-1` if the `flag` is `True` (i.e., all elements are identical), which is correct. Otherwise, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element. This is incorrect because the minimum count should be based on the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the "beautiful" property, not just the first element.

6. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the edge case where the array has only one element (`n == 1`). In such a case, the array is trivially non-beautiful, and the output should be `-1`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
