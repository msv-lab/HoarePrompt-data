### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.

2. **Check for Identical Elements**:
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are identical by iterating through the array and setting a flag `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If all elements are identical (`flag` remains `True`), it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing any elements.
   - This check is correct. If all elements are the same, the array will always be beautiful, and it is impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Counting Elements**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and starts counting the occurrences of the first element `val` in the array.
   - It iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive occurrences of `val` and updating `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive `val` elements found.
   - After the loop, it ensures that the last count is also considered by updating `ans` one final time.
   - This logic is flawed. The program is trying to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element, but this does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.
   - The correct approach should be to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the condition that allows the array to be beautiful. Specifically, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` such that `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the array is not entirely identical, it prints the minimum count of consecutive elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.
   - However, as noted in the original assessment, this output is incorrect because it does not consider the correct criterion for making the array not beautiful.

### Correct Approach:

- **Identify the Minimum Removal**:
  - To make the array not beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.
  - One way to do this is to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break all such sequences. This can be done by counting the number of elements that are part of such sequences and removing them.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**: `[2, 2, 2]`
  - All elements are the same. The program correctly prints `-1`.

- **Test Case 2**: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`
  - The array is not entirely identical. The program counts the consecutive `1`s and `2`s and prints `1`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `1` because removing the element at index `4` (0-based) breaks the beauty condition.

- **Test Case 3**: `[1]`
  - The array has only one element. The program correctly prints `-1`.

- **Test Case 4**: `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`
  - The array is not entirely identical. The program counts the consecutive `3`s and `5` and prints `3`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `3` because removing the first three elements breaks the beauty condition.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it only checks for the minimum number of consecutive identical elements, which is not the correct criterion for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. The program fails to identify the correct minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.
