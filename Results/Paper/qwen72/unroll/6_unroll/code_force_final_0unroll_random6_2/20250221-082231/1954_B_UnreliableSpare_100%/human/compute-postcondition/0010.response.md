Postcondition: **`a` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same input integer, `arr` remains the same list of integers, `flag` is `True` indicating that all consecutive elements in `arr` are the same, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` (or `Decimal('Infinity')` if no such sequence exists), `val` is set to the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`.**
