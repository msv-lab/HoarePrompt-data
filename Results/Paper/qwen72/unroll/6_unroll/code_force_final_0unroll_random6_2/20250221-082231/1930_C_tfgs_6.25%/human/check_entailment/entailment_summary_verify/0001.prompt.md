You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the user. It modifies the list `a` by incrementing each element `a[i]` by `i + 1`. It then ensures that the modified list `a` contains unique elements by inserting additional elements as necessary, while maintaining the total length of the list as `n`. The final list `ans` is printed, containing all unique elements from the modified list `a` and any additional elements needed to ensure the list length is `n`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`**: The program modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`. This step is correct because it simulates the operation of inserting `a[i] + i` into the set `S` and then removing `a[i]` from `a`.

3. **Counting and Removing Duplicates**: The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the modified array `a`. It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts the set in descending order. This step is correct because it ensures that the set `S` contains only unique elements and is sorted in the required order.

4. **Constructing the Lexicographically Largest Array `b`**:
   - The program initializes a list `ans` to store the elements of the array `b`.
   - It iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a` and attempts to insert as many elements as possible that are just less than the current element to maximize the lexicographical order.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the number of elements that can be inserted between `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` without violating the uniqueness constraint. This is done using the `min` function to ensure that the number of insertions does not exceed the remaining count of elements to be inserted (`cnt`), the difference between `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` minus one, and the count of `a[i-1]` in the `Counter`.
   - It then appends these elements to `ans` and updates the `Counter` and `cnt` accordingly.
   - Finally, it appends the remaining elements to `ans` by decrementing the last element of `ans` until `cnt` is zero.

5. **Output**: The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case, which should be the lexicographically largest array `b`.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic for constructing the lexicographically largest array `b`. Specifically, the way the program handles the insertion of elements between `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` might not always produce the correct result. The program should ensure that it always inserts the largest possible elements first, and it should handle the case where the difference between consecutive elements is small more carefully.

Let's analyze the specific test cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `a = [2, 1]`
  - After modification: `a = [3, 2]`
  - After removing duplicates and sorting: `a = [3, 2]`
  - The program correctly constructs `ans = [3, 2]`.

- **Test Case 2**: `a = [1, 100, 1000, 1000000, 1000000000]`
  - After modification: `a = [2, 101, 1002, 1000001, 1000000001]`
  - After removing duplicates and sorting: `a = [1000000001, 1000001, 1002, 101, 2]`
  - The program correctly constructs `ans = [1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 102, 2]`.

- **Test Case 3**: `a = [6, 4, 8]`
  - After modification: `a = [7, 5, 11]`
  - After removing duplicates and sorting: `a = [11, 7, 5]`
  - The program correctly constructs `ans = [11, 7, 6]`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle the test cases correctly. However, the logic for inserting elements between consecutive elements might be overly complex and could be simplified.

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided test cases and the problem description. It correctly modifies the array, removes duplicates, and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b`.
