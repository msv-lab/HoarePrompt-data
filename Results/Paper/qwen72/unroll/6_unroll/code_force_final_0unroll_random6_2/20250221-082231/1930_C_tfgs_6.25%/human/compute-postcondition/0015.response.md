The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `test_cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is constrained to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each inner list in `test_cases` represents a test case, with the first element being an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and the second element being a list of `n` integers, each within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The exact nature of the result for each test case is not specified in the provided information, but it is implied that the function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `test_cases`, where each inner list contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
