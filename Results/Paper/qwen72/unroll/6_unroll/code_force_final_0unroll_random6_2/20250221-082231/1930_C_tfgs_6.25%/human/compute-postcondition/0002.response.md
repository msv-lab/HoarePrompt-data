The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the function parameters and the list `a` are already defined, but they do not directly affect the loop head. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
