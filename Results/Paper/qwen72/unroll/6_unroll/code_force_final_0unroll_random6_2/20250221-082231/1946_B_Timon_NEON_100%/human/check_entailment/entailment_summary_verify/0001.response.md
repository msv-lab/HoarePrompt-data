### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum back into the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function correctly returns the result of `number % 1000000007`, which is used to ensure the final sum is within the required modulo.
   - **func_2:** This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices. However, there are several issues with this function:
     - The `new_segment` and `max_segment` are initialized as lists, but they are used as if they were single integers.
     - The `segments_variants` list is not properly managed, and the logic for appending segments is flawed.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array ends with a positive number.
     - The function does not return the correct maximum sum of the subarray.
   - **func_3:** This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations. The summary provided for `func_3` is incorrect because the function does not return a list with `quantity` elements, each being `number`. Instead, it initializes `answer` to 0 and does nothing else.

3. **Algorithmic Approach:**
   - To solve this problem, we need to understand that the maximum possible sum after `k` operations can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is positive, we can keep adding it to the array to maximize the sum.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative, the best we can do is to add zero (i.e., an empty subarray) `k` times, which does not change the sum.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - We need to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray using Kadane's algorithm.
   - If the maximum sum is positive, we can compute the final sum as the initial sum of the array plus the maximum sum multiplied by `k`.
   - If the maximum sum is zero or negative, the final sum remains the initial sum of the array.

5. **Code Review:**
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the required logic.
   - `func_2` is supposed to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray but fails to do so correctly.
   - `func_3` is incomplete and does not contribute to the solution.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect because:
- `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
- `func_3` is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations.
- The overall logic for solving the problem is not implemented correctly.

Final: **False**
