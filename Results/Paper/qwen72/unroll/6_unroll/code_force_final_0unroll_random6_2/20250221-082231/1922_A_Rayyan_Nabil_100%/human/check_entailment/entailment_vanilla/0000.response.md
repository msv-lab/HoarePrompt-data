### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template, but string `c` does not.
   - A string `s` matches the template `t` if:
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is lowercase, then `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is uppercase, then `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` as input.
     - It iterates through each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
     - For each position, it checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both different from `c[i]`.
     - If this condition is true for any position, it returns 'YES'.
     - If the loop completes without finding such a position, it returns 'NO'.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
     - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to a list `results`.
     - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is based on the idea that if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for any position `i`, then we can construct a template `t` where `t[i]` is the uppercase version of `c[i]`.
   - This ensures that `a` and `b` match the template (since their characters at position `i` are different from `c[i]` and thus different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`), while `c` does not match the template (since `c[i]` is the same as the lowercase version of `t[i]`).

4. **Checking Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `a` and `b` are identical and different from `c` correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `a` and `b` are different from each other and from `c` correctly.
   - The function correctly returns 'NO' if no such position `i` exists where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both different from `c[i]`.

5. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case as described.
   - It correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` is sound and the input/output handling in `func_2` is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
