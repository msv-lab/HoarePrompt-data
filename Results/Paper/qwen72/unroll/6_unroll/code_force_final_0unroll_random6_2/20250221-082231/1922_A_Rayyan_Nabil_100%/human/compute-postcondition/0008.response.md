Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. It then performs `t` iterations, each time reading an integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 20`) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters). For each iteration, it calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` and appends the result to a list `results`. After all iterations, it prints each element in the `results` list, one per line. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
