The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each element is between 0 and the length of the list (exclusive). It does not return a new list but instead prints the first integer `i` that either does not appear in `arr` or is the second unique integer in `arr` that appears exactly once. If no such integer is found, the function completes without printing anything.
