### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Both players play optimally, and the game ends when `a` is empty.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many unique integers as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to exclude the smallest integers that Alice might include.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - If an integer appears more than once in `a`, Alice can always include one of them in `c` and Bob can remove the other, ensuring that the integer is included in `c`.
   - If an integer appears exactly once, Alice will try to include it, and Bob will try to exclude it.
   - If an integer does not appear at all, it will be the MEX of `c`.

4. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It initializes a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` and checks the frequency of each integer.
   - If an integer appears at least twice, it is included in `c` and the loop continues.
   - If an integer appears exactly once, Alice will try to include it, and Bob will try to exclude it. The program counts such integers (`cou`).
   - If `cou` reaches 2 or if an integer does not appear at all, the program prints the current integer as the MEX and breaks the loop.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not present in `c` or appears exactly once.
   - The logic ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by considering the frequency of each integer.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and processes each one independently.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
