Reasoning:

The program is designed to find the MEX of the final array `c` after Alice and Bob play their game optimally. The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategies of both players and how they affect the MEX of the final array `c`.

### Optimal Strategies:
- **Alice's Strategy:** Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`. To do this, she should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`, especially those that are unique or appear only once in `a`.
- **Bob's Strategy:** Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the final array `c`. To do this, he should try to remove the smallest integers that are unique or appear only once in `a`, to prevent Alice from including them in `c`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program first counts the frequency of each integer in the array `arr` using a list `freq` of size `n + 1`. This is correct because the integers in `arr` are guaranteed to be between 0 and `n-1`.

2. **Finding the MEX:**
   - The program then iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` and checks the frequency of each integer.
   - If an integer `i` appears at least twice (`freq[i] >= 2`), it is ignored because it will not affect the MEX of `c`.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once (`freq[i] == 1`), a counter `cou` is incremented.
   - If the counter `cou` reaches 2 or if an integer `i` does not appear at all (`freq[i] == 0`), the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

### Why This Works:
- **MEX Calculation:**
  - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.
  - If an integer `i` appears at least twice, it will not be the MEX because it will be included in `c` by Alice and Bob.
  - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, it will be included in `c` by Alice or Bob, but the next smallest integer that does not appear at all will be the MEX.
  - The program correctly identifies the first integer `i` that either does not appear in `arr` or is the second unique integer in `arr` that appears exactly once, which is the MEX of the final array `c`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case where all integers in `arr` appear at least twice by correctly printing the smallest integer that does not appear in `arr`.
- The program also handles the case where there are multiple unique integers by correctly identifying the second unique integer that appears exactly once, which is the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the final array `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It correctly counts the frequencies and determines the MEX by checking the conditions for each integer.

Correctness: **True**
