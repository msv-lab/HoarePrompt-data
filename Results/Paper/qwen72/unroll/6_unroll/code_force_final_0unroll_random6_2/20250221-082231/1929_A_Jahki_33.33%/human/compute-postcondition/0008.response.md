Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers (with a length between 2 and 100, and each integer between 1 and 10^9) and an integer `num2` (representing the number of test cases, between 1 and 500). It returns `True` if the list `a` is strictly increasing (i.e., no element is greater than or equal to the next element). Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `num2`. **
