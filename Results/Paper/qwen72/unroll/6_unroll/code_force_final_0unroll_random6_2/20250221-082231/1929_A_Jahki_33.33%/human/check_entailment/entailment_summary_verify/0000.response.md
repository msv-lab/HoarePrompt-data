### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from index 2 to n.
   - The beauty can be maximized by sorting the array in non-decreasing order, as the differences between consecutive elements will be minimized, and the sum of these differences will be maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints 0.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Evaluating `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is strictly increasing.
   - It returns `True` if the array is strictly increasing and `False` otherwise.
   - The function does not handle the case where all elements are the same correctly. It will return `False` if the array has any repeated elements, even if they are all the same.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program fails to handle the case where all elements in the array are the same.
   - However, the problem description does not require the array to be strictly increasing; it only requires the array to be non-decreasing.
   - Therefore, the function `func_1` is not the correct function to determine if the array is already in the optimal state for calculating the maximum beauty.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach is to always sort the array and then calculate the beauty.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which maximizes the beauty.
   - The function `func_1` is unnecessary and can be removed.

6. **Revised Program:**
   - The program should always sort the array and calculate the beauty.
   - The function `func_1` can be removed, and the program can directly calculate the beauty after sorting.

### Revised Program:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is **correct** in identifying that the program fails to handle the case where all elements in the array are the same.
- However, the program is incorrect not just because of this edge case but because it uses an incorrect function (`func_1`) to determine the optimal state of the array.
- The program should always sort the array and calculate the beauty, as sorting ensures the maximum beauty.

Final: **False**
