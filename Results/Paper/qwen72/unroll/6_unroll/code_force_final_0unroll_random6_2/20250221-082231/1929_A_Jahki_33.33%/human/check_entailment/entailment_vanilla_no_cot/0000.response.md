Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the program uses this function to determine whether to print `0` or to calculate the beauty. This is incorrect because the maximum beauty of an array is not determined by whether it is already sorted.
   - The maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array in non-decreasing order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Beauty**:
   - The program calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements of the sorted array. This is correct for the beauty calculation, but the condition to print `0` is incorrect.
   - The beauty of the array should always be calculated after sorting, regardless of the initial order of the array.

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Input Reading**:
  - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
  - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a`.

- **Sorting**:
  - The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order to maximize the beauty.

- **Beauty Calculation**:
  - The beauty is calculated by summing the differences between consecutive elements of the sorted array.

- **Output**:
  - The calculated beauty is printed for each test case.

This corrected program will correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.
