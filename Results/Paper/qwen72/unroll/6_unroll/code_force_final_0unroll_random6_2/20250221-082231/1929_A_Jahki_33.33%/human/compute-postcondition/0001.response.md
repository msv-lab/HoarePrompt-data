The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `num2`. For the loop to execute, `num2` must be greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `num2`. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so we don't need to adjust it. The state of `a` and `order` are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` must be greater than 1, `order` is 0**
