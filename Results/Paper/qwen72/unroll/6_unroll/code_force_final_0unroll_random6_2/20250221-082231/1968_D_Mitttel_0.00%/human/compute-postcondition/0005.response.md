The only variables in the loop head are `steps` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `steps` and `k`. If `steps` is less than `k`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `steps` is 0, and `k` is not defined in the state. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be greater than 0.

State: **`start_pos` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= n, `score` is 0, `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`, `steps` is 0, `visited` is an empty dictionary, `cycle_start` is -1, `k` must be greater than 0**
