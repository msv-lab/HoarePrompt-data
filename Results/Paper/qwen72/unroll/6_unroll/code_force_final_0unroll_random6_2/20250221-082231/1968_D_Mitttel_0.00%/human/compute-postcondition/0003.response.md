Output State: **`start_pos` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= n, `score` is 0, `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`, `steps` is 0, `visited` is an empty dictionary.** 

The initial values of `start_pos`, `score`, `current_pos`, and `steps` remain unchanged. The variable `visited` is now an empty dictionary.
