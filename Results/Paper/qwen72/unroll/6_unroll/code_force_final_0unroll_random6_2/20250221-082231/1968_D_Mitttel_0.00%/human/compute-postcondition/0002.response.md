Output State: **`start_pos` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= n, `score` is 0, `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`, `steps` is 0.**

The variable `steps` is initialized to 0, and the values of `start_pos`, `score`, and `current_pos` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `steps` being 0.
