You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a list of length `n` where `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` and for all 1 <= i < n-1, `ans[i]` is the cumulative sum of `arr` values from index 0 to i, adjusted to be greater than `arr[i]`. The last element `ans[n-1]` is not modified by the loop.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, for all 1 <= i < n-1, `ans[i]` is the cumulative sum of `arr` values from index 0 to i, adjusted to be greater than `arr[i]`, and `ans[n-1]` is `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`, and returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the middle elements are cumulative sums of `arr` adjusted to be greater than the corresponding `arr` elements, and the last element is the sum of the second-to-last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, for all 1 <= i < n-1, `ans[i]` is the cumulative sum of `arr` values from index 0 to i, adjusted to be greater than `arr[i]`, and `ans[n-1]` is `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
