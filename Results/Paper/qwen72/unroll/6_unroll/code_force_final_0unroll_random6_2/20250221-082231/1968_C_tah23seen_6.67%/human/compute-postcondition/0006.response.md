The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 500, and each element in `arr` is an integer between 1 and 500. `n` is an integer between 2 and 500. The function returns a list `ans` of length `n` where:
- `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`,
- For all indices `1 <= i < n-1`, `ans[i]` is the cumulative sum of `arr` values from index 0 to `i`, adjusted to be greater than `arr[i]`,
- `ans[n-1]` is `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`, and returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the middle elements are cumulative sums of `arr` adjusted to be greater than the corresponding `arr` elements, and the last element is the sum of the second-to-last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.**
