Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes `M` to \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common modulus used in competitive programming to prevent integer overflow and ensure the result fits within standard integer types.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This is done using the `pow` function with the third argument as the modulus `M`.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - It initializes `a` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
   - It reads `m` lines, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, and adds these values to `a`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - It initializes `s` to 0, which will store the sum of the expected friendship values over all `k` excursions.
   - It iterates `k` times, and in each iteration, it updates `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship value for that iteration.
   - The expected increase in friendship value is calculated as `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
     - `c * i * c * m` represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the chosen pair being friends and their value increasing by 1.
     - `c * a` represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the initial friendship values of the pairs.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints `s % M` for each test case.

However, there is a logical issue in the expected value calculation. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated differently. Specifically, the expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship value due to the chosen pairs being friends.

The correct expected value for each excursion is:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \frac{a + m \cdot i}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

Where:
- \( a \) is the sum of initial friendship values.
- \( m \cdot i \) is the expected increase in friendship value for the \( i \)-th excursion.
- \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

The program incorrectly multiplies `c` by `i` and `c` by `m` in the loop, which does not correctly represent the expected value.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
