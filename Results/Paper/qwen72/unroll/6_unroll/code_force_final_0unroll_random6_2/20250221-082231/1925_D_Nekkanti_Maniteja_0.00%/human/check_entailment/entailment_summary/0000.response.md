Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the expected sum of friendship values for pairs of children chosen for excursions. The key points to consider are:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The number of children \( n \).
   - The number of pairs of friends \( m \).
   - The number of excursions \( k \).
   - The friendship values for each pair of friends.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of children is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - The modular inverse \( c \) of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) is correctly calculated using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the current friendship values of all pairs of friends, plus the number of pairs of friends \( m \) (since each chosen pair of friends increases their friendship value by 1 for subsequent excursions).
   - The total expected sum of friendship values after \( k \) excursions is the sum of the expected values for each excursion.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) for each test case.
   - It calculates the modular inverse \( c \) of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
   - It initializes `a` to the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
   - It initializes `s` to 0, which will store the total expected sum of friendship values.
   - It iterates over \( k \) excursions, updating `s` with the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion.
   - The expected increase in friendship values for the \( i \)-th excursion is \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \).

5. **Correctness of the Formula**:
   - The formula \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \) is used to update `s` for each excursion.
   - This formula is derived from the expected value of the sum of friendship values, considering the increase in friendship values for each chosen pair of friends.

6. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program correctly uses modular arithmetic to ensure that the result is within the range of \( 10^9 + 7 \).

However, there is a potential issue with the formula used to update `s`. The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the current friendship values of all pairs of friends, plus the number of pairs of friends \( m \) (since each chosen pair of friends increases their friendship value by 1 for subsequent excursions). The correct formula should be:

\[ \text{expected\_value} = c \cdot (a + i \cdot m) \]

Where:
- \( c \) is the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
- \( a \) is the sum of initial friendship values.
- \( i \cdot m \) is the increase in friendship values due to the \( i \)-th excursion.

The program's formula \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \) is incorrect because it multiplies \( c \) twice, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be corrected to use the formula \( c \cdot (a + i \cdot m) \) instead of \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \).
