### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and then reads `m` lines of friendship data.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct because the number of possible pairs of children is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), and the modular inverse is used to compute the probability of selecting a specific pair.

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The variable `a` is used to store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends. This is correctly computed by iterating over the `m` lines of friendship data.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The variable `s` is used to accumulate the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The loop iterates `k` times, and for each iteration, it adds `c * i * c * m + c * a` to `s`.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` is intended to represent the expected increase in the friendship value for the i-th excursion, but it is incorrect. The correct term should be `c * (i + 1) * m` because the friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion, and the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the i-th excursion is `c * (i + 1) * m`.
   - The term `c * a` correctly represents the expected contribution of the initial friendship values to the total sum.

5. **Output**:
   - The final value of `s` is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct for the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect because the term `c * i * c * m` in the loop is not the correct way to calculate the expected increase in the friendship value for the i-th excursion. The correct term should be `c * (i + 1) * m`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * (i + 1) * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
