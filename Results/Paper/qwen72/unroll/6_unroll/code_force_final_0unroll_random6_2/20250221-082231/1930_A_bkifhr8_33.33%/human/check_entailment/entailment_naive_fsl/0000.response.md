Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of elements from the list. Specifically, the logic for removing elements is flawed. The program uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` to remove elements, but this will not work as intended because it does not correctly update the indices of the list after each removal. Additionally, the program does not sort the list, which is necessary to ensure that the minimum values are always chosen in an optimal way.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
2
1 1 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

The program fails because it does not correctly remove the elements and does not sort the list to ensure that the minimum values are always chosen. This results in an incorrect score calculation.
