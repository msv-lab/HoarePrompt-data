Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers. `t` is now an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input.
- The precondition that the function should take two parameters, where the first parameter is an integer `t` and the second parameter is a list of lists, remains valid.
- The range of `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and the structure of the list of lists (each inner list contains 2n integers, 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) are still valid and unchanged.
