Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers `lst`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes the score `ans` to 0 for each test case and prepares a list `ans_f` to store the results of each test case.

3. **Processing the List**:
   - The program splits the input string `l` into a list of strings `lst`.
   - It then iterates `n * 2` times, which is the length of the list `lst` for each test case.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the length of `lst` is not 2. If it is not 2, it adds the minimum of the first two elements to the score `ans` and removes these two elements from the list.
   - If the length of `lst` is 2, it adds the minimum of the remaining two elements to the score `ans` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the program prints the results stored in `ans_f`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **List Removal Logic**: The program uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which are incorrect. The expression `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` will always evaluate to 0 and 2, respectively, regardless of the iteration. This will lead to incorrect elements being removed from the list.
- **Efficiency**: The program does not sort the list, which is a crucial step to ensure that the minimum values are always selected optimally. Sorting the list and then selecting pairs from the beginning will guarantee the maximum score.
- **List Length Check**: The check `if len(lst) != 2` is unnecessary and can be simplified. The loop should simply iterate `n` times, selecting pairs from the sorted list.

To correct these issues, the program should:

1. Sort the list `lst` before processing.
2. Iterate `n` times, selecting pairs from the beginning of the sorted list.
3. Remove the unnecessary length check.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

Explanation of the corrected program:
- **Sorting**: `lst.sort()` ensures that the smallest elements are at the beginning of the list.
- **Summing Minimums**: `sum(lst[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))` sums the minimum values of each pair by selecting every second element from the sorted list.
- **Efficiency**: This approach is more efficient and guarantees the correct result.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
