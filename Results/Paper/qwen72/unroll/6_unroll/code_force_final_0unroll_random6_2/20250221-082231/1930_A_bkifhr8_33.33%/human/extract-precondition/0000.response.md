Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be:

```python
def max_score(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing 2n integers.
