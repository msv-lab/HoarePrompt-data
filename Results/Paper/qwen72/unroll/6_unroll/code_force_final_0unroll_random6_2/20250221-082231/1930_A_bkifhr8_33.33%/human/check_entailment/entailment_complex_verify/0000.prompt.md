You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()
        
        lst = l.split(' ')
        
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is the same input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the sum of the minimum values of pairs from the input lists.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The loop prints each element in the list `ans_f`, which contains `t` elements, each being the sum of the minimum values of pairs from the input lists. The variables `t` and `ans_f` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. It then reads `t` lines of input, each containing a list of 2n integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, the function calculates the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from the input list and appends this sum to a result list `ans_f`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element in `ans_f`, which contains `t` elements, each being the sum of the minimum values of pairs from the corresponding input list. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of elements from the list. Specifically, the logic for removing elements is flawed. The program uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` to remove elements, but this will not work as intended because it does not correctly update the indices of the list after each removal. Additionally, the program does not sort the list, which is necessary to ensure that the minimum values are always chosen in an optimal way.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
2
1 1 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

The program fails because it does not correctly remove the elements and does not sort the list to ensure that the minimum values are always chosen. This results in an incorrect score calculation.
