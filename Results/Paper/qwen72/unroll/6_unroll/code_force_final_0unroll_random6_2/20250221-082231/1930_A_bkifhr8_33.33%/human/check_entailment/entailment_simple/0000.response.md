Reasoning:

The program attempts to solve the problem by reading multiple test cases and for each test case, it tries to calculate the maximum score by repeatedly selecting pairs of integers, adding the minimum of each pair to the score, and then removing these pairs from the list. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Pair Selection and Removal**:
   - The program attempts to remove elements from the list using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`. This is incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, respectively, which do not correctly index the elements to be removed.
   - The correct approach should be to remove the first two elements of the list after each iteration.

2. **Inefficient Pair Selection**:
   - The program does not sort the list before selecting pairs, which means it might not always select the optimal pairs to maximize the score.
   - To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest two numbers, which can be achieved by sorting the list and then taking the first n elements (since the first n elements will be the minimum values of the pairs).

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is incorrect. It should be `if len(lst) > 1:` to ensure the loop continues until all pairs are processed.

4. **Variable Reuse**:
   - The variable `i` is reused in the inner loop, which can lead to confusion and potential bugs. It is better to use a different variable for the inner loop.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
