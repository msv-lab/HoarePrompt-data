Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it updates the count of matching elements (`sm`) as it slides the window over the array `a`. Specifically, the conditions used to increment and decrement `sm` are incorrect. Hereâ€™s a more detailed explanation:

1. **Initial Count Calculation**:
   - The initial count of matching elements (`sm`) is correctly calculated using the intersection of the first `m` elements of `a` and all elements of `b`.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program attempts to slide the window over `a` and update `sm` accordingly. However, the conditions for updating `sm` are flawed:
     - `if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]: sm += 1` should be `if a[r] in cb and ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]: sm += 1` to correctly check if the new element `a[r]` is in `b` and if its count in `ca` is less than its count in `cb`.
     - `if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]: sm -= 1` should be `if a[r - m] in cb and ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]: sm -= 1` to correctly check if the element being removed from the window is in `b` and if its count in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        # Add the new element to the window
        if a[r] in cb and ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        # Remove the old element from the window
        if a[r - m] in cb and ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))
```

This corrected version ensures that the count of matching elements is updated correctly as the window slides over the array `a`.
