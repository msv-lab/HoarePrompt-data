### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` from the input.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.

2. **Counter Initialization:**
   - `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`.
   - `ca` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in the sorted first `m` elements of list `a`.

3. **Initial Check:**
   - The program calculates the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between the first `m` elements of `a` and `b` using `(ca & cb).values()`.
   - If this sum is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans` by 1.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program then iterates over the remaining elements of `a` using a sliding window approach.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
     - It checks if the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than its frequency in `cb`. If so, it increments `sm` by 1.
     - It updates the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` by incrementing it.
   - For each element `a[r - m]` removed from the window:
     - It checks if the frequency of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is less than or equal to its frequency in `cb`. If so, it decrements `sm` by 1.
     - It updates the frequency of `a[r - m]` in `ca` by decrementing it.
   - After updating the window, it checks if the new sum `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`. If so, it increments `ans` by 1.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the total number of good subsegments `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly initializes the `Counter` objects `cb` and `ca` to count the frequencies of elements in `b` and the first `m` elements of `a`, respectively.
- The initial check for the first window is correct.
- The sliding window approach is used to efficiently update the frequencies and the sum `sm` as the window moves through the array `a`.
- The conditions for updating `sm` and `ca` are correctly implemented to ensure that the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements is accurately maintained.
- The final answer `ans` is correctly accumulated and returned.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and the implementation are sound, and the program should handle the given constraints and inputs correctly.

### Correctness:
