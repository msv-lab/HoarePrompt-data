The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, where both `x` and `y` are in the range 0 to 99, inclusive. It calculates the number of screens required based on the values of `x` and `y`, and appends this number to a list `result`. After all iterations, the function prints each element of `result` on a new line, where each element represents the number of screens required for the corresponding iteration. The function does not return any value.
