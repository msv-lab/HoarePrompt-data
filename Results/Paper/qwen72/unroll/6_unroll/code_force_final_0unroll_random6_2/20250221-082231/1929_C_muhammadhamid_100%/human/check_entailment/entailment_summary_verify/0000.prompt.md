You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `k`, `x`, and `a` where `2 <= k <= 30`, `1 <= x <= 100`, and `1 <= a <= 10^9`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` by iterating `x` times and updating `s` in each iteration. After the iterations, it prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged for each test case, but `s` is reset to 1 for each new test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the required number of coins `s` to ensure Sasha can always win any number of coins is flawed. The program increments `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each consecutive loss, but this does not accurately reflect the strategy needed to guarantee winning any number of coins.

For example, consider the input `2 1 7`. According to the problem description, Sasha can place a bet of 1 coin initially, and if he loses, he can place a bet of 2 coins. This strategy ensures that he can always recover and eventually win any number of coins. However, the program calculates `s` as follows:
- Initial `s = 1`
- After one loss: `s += 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
- The program then checks if `a >= s`, which is `7 >= 3`, and prints "Yes".

This is incorrect because the strategy described in the problem involves placing bets that are multiples of the previous bet, not just incrementing by a fixed amount. The correct approach should involve calculating the minimum number of coins required to ensure that Sasha can always recover from `x` consecutive losses and still have enough coins to continue betting.

A correct approach would be to calculate the minimum number of coins required to ensure that Sasha can always recover from `x` consecutive losses and still have enough coins to continue betting. The correct logic should involve a geometric progression to account for the increasing bet sizes.

For example, the correct calculation for `2 1 7` should be:
- Initial bet: 1 coin
- After one loss: Bet 2 coins (1 * 2)
- Total coins required: 1 + 2 = 3

For `2 3 15`:
- Initial bet: 1 coin
- After one loss: Bet 2 coins (1 * 2)
- After two losses: Bet 4 coins (2 * 2)
- After three losses: Bet 8 coins (4 * 2)
- Total coins required: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15

The program does not correctly implement this logic, leading to incorrect results for some cases.
