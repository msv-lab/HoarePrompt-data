### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha starts with `a` coins.
   - If he wins a bet of `y` coins, he gains `y * (k - 1)` coins.
   - If he loses a bet, he loses `y` coins.
   - He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee having at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins, he must be able to recover from any sequence of losses.
   - The maximum number of consecutive losses is `x`, so after `x` losses, he must have enough coins to place another bet and potentially win.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - If Sasha can place a bet of `1` coin and win, he will have `k` coins.
   - If he loses, he will have `a - 1` coins.
   - After `x` losses, he will have `a - x` coins.
   - To ensure he can always place another bet, he must have at least `1` coin left after `x` losses, which means `a - x >= 1` or `a >= x + 1`.

4. **Mathematical Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the minimum number of coins `s` required to guarantee that Sasha can always place another bet after `x` losses.
   - The formula used in the program is `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` for each of the `x` losses.
   - This formula is derived from the idea that after each loss, Sasha needs to have enough coins to place a bet that can recover the loss and still have a positive number of coins left.

5. **Program Logic:**
   - The program initializes `s` to `1`.
   - It then iterates `x` times, each time adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to `s`.
   - This calculation is intended to determine the minimum number of coins `s` needed to ensure that Sasha can always place another bet after `x` losses.
   - Finally, it checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.

6. **Verification:**
   - For the first test case: `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 7`.
     - `s` starts at `1`.
     - After 1 loss: `s += 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
     - Sasha needs at least `3` coins to guarantee he can always place another bet after 1 loss.
     - Since `a = 7` is greater than `3`, the answer is `YES`.
   - For the second test case: `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`.
     - `s` starts at `1`.
     - After 1 loss: `s += 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
     - Sasha needs at least `3` coins to guarantee he can always place another bet after 1 loss.
     - Since `a = 1` is less than `3`, the answer is `NO`.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` is just enough to cover the losses and still place another bet.
   - It also handles the case where `a` is much larger than `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins `s` required to ensure that Sasha can always place another bet after `x` losses. It then checks if the initial number of coins `a` is sufficient to meet this requirement. The logic and the formula used are appropriate for the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
