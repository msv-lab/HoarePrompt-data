Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the original `a x b` rectangle. According to the problem, Bob can form another rectangle if and only if at least one of the dimensions `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1. This is because if either dimension is even and greater than 1, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle that is different from the original (considering the 90-degree rotation equivalence).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    if a == 1 and b == 1:
        return 'no'
    if a % 2 == 0 and a > 1:
        return 'yes'
    if b % 2 == 0 and b > 1:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'
```

This function checks the conditions correctly:
- If both `a` and `b` are 1, it returns 'no' because no cuts can be made.
- If `a` is even and greater than 1, it returns 'yes'.
- If `b` is even and greater than 1, it returns 'yes'.
- Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

This should correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle.
