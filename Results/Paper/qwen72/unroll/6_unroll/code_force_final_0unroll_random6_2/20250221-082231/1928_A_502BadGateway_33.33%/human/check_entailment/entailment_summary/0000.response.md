Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, but it does not consider the full logic needed to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original `a \times b` rectangle. According to the problem, Bob can form a different rectangle if and only if one of the dimensions is divisible by 2 and the other dimension is greater than 1. This is because:

1. If both `a` and `b` are 1, no cut can be made, so the answer is "No".
2. If one of the dimensions is 1 and the other is odd, the only possible cuts will result in rectangles that are the same as the original when rotated, so the answer is "No".
3. If one of the dimensions is 1 and the other is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a different rectangle, so the answer is "Yes".
4. If both dimensions are greater than 1, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a different rectangle, so the answer is "Yes".

The current implementation of `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to cover all the cases. For example, it will incorrectly return "No" for the input `1 3`, which should be "No" because no different rectangle can be formed.

Correctness: **False**
