Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined method or variable, as the function definition does not specify any parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each coordinate x_i and y_i is an integer such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**
