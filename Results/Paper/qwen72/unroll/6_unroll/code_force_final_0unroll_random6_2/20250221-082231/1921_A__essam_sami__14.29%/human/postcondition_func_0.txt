The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the squared distances between two pairs of diagonally opposite corners of the square and prints the smaller of these two squared distances. The function does not return any values; instead, it directly prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the variables used within the loop are not retained or meaningful outside the loop. The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.
