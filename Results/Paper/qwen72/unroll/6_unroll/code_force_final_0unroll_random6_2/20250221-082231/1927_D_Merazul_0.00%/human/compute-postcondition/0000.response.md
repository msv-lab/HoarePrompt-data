The code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that maps the input values to integers and returns an iterator of these integers. This function does not affect the initial state of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, or the queries. The initial state remains unchanged, and the function `R` is now available for use.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, a is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, and each query is a pair of integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `R` is a function that maps input values to integers and returns an iterator of these integers.**
