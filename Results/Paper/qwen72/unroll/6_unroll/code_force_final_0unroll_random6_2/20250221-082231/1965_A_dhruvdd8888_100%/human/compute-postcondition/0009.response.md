To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `nums`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range` function is used with the arguments `len(nums) - 2`, `0`, and `-1`. This means the loop will start at `len(nums) - 2` and decrement `i` by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive).

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute if `len(nums) - 2` is greater than or equal to 1. This ensures that the starting value of `i` is within the valid range for the loop to execute at least once.
- Therefore, `len(nums)` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

### Adjusting the State:
- The state of `nums` must be adjusted to ensure it has at least 3 elements.
- The state of `i` will be set to `len(nums) - 2` at the start of the loop.
- The other variables (`t`, `N`, `ls`, `nw`, `cw`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `N` remains the input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements where each element is 0, `ls` is the sum of the initial elements in `nums`, `nw` is True, `cw` is True, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`**
