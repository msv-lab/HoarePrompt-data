Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values `n` and `x`.
   - This part of the program is accurate and correctly follows the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of `x` and checks if `i` is a divisor of `x`.
   - It appends both `i` and `x // i` to the lists `output1` and `output2`.
   - It reverses `output1` and concatenates it with `output2` to ensure all divisors are included.
   - This function is correct and efficiently finds all divisors of `x`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks two conditions: `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`.
   - These conditions are derived from the problem's requirement that the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - For each condition, it calls `func_1` to find the divisors of the respective value.
   - It then filters these divisors to find valid `k` values:
     - `k` must be even and greater than or equal to `x`.
     - `(s + 2) / 2` is used to convert the divisor `s` to a potential `k` value.
   - This part of the logic is correct and aligns with the problem's constraints.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k` must be greater than 1.
   - It also correctly handles the constraints `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program uses `(s + 2) / 2` to convert the divisor `s` to a potential `k` value. This is correct because `s` is a divisor of `2k - 2`, and adding 2 to `s` and dividing by 2 gives the correct `k` value.
   - The program ensures that `k` is even and greater than or equal to `x` by checking `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - The program correctly uses a set to ensure that all `k` values are unique before printing the length of the set.

Given the problem description and the constraints, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. The logic and implementation are sound, and the edge cases are appropriately managed.

Final: **True**
