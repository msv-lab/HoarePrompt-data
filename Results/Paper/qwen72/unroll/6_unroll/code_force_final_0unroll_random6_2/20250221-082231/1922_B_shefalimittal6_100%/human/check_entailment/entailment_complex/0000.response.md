### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It initializes `idx` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of sticks) and then reads the list of stick lengths `a` from the next `n` elements of the list.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - It initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It iterates through the list of stick lengths and increments the corresponding index in `v`.

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - It initializes `cnt` to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative count of sticks.
   - It iterates through the list `v` and for each stick length `i`:
     - If there are at least 2 sticks of length `2^i`, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of this length and one stick of any length less than `2^i` and adds it to `ans`.
     - If there are at least 3 sticks of length `2^i`, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of this length and adds it to `ans`.
     - It updates `cnt` with the number of sticks of length `2^i`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results, one per line.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- The logic for counting the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle is based on the fact that for a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
- The program uses the fact that if there are multiple sticks of the same length, they can form a triangle with other sticks of the same or different lengths.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when there are fewer than 3 sticks or when no triangles can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

### Correctness:
**True**
