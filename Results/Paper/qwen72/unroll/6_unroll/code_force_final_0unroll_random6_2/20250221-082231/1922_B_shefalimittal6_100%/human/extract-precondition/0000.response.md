It seems there was a mistake in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take parameters for the number of test cases and the lists of stick lengths. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def count_triangle_ways(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) with n being an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a being a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
