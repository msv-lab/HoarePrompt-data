Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an array `a` of positive integers. It accepts the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and for each test case, it accepts the length of the array `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and the elements of the array `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, if `n` is 2, it prints the minimum value of the array `a`. If `n` is greater than 2, it prints the maximum of the second smallest values of all possible subarrays of length 3 in the array `a`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program is that the variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, and the variables `n` and `a` are undefined. **
