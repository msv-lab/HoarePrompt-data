### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` correctly handles the input by first reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Special Case for `n == 2`**: If the length of the array `n` is 2, the function correctly prints the minimum value of the array. This is because, in an array of length 2, the only possible operation is to set both elements to the minimum of the two, which is the correct behavior.

3. **General Case for `n > 2`**:
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays of length 3 in the array `a`.
   - For each subarray, it sorts the subarray and takes the second smallest element (i.e., the median of the subarray).
   - It keeps track of the maximum of these second smallest elements and prints this value after processing all subarrays.

4. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median of a subarray of length 3 is the second element after sorting. This is correctly implemented in the function.
   - The function aims to find the maximum possible value that can be achieved by repeatedly applying the operation. The key insight is that the maximum value that can be achieved is the maximum of the second smallest elements of all subarrays of length 3. This is because the median of any subarray of length 3 will be the middle value, and the maximum of these middle values will be the highest value that can be consistently set across the array.

5. **Output**:
   - For the first test case with `a = [1, 2]`, the output is `1`, which is correct.
   - For the second test case with `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function correctly identifies the maximum of the second smallest elements of all subarrays of length 3, which is `4`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and general cases appropriately, and the output matches the expected results for the given examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
