Output State: **The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive. The function `func` has processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the minimum value of the array `a` if `n` is 2, or the maximum of the second smallest values of all possible subarrays of length 3 in the array `a` if `n` is greater than 2. The variable `n` and the array `a` have been redefined for each iteration of the loop, and their final values are undefined after the loop completes.**
