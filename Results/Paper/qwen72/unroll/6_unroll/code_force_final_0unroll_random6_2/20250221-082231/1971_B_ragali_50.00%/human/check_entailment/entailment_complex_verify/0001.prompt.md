You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        
        a = set()
        
        for i in s:

            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The value of `s` will be the last input string provided by the user, stripped of any leading or trailing spaces. The set `a` will contain the unique characters of the last input string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from user input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, and then for each of the `t` iterations, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. For each string `s`, it checks if the string contains more than one unique character. If it does, it prints 'YES' followed by a modified version of the string `s` (either by rotating it or reversing it, depending on the conditions). If the string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. After all iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the last input string `s` and its unique characters are stored in the variables `s` and `a`, respectively.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Set Creation:**
   - It creates a set `a` to store unique characters from the string `s`.

3. **Check for Unique Characters:**
   - If the set `a` has more than one unique character (`len(a) > 1`), it means that the string `s` can be rearranged to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.

4. **Rearrangement Logic:**
   - The program attempts to rearrange the string `s` in three different ways:
     - **First Attempt:** `newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]` splits the string into two halves and concatenates them in reverse order.
     - **Second Attempt:** `isreverse = s[::-1]` reverses the entire string.
     - **Third Attempt:** `print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])` is a redundant attempt, as it is the same as the first attempt.

5. **Output:**
   - If any of the rearranged strings (`newstr` or `isreverse`) is not equal to `s`, it prints "YES" followed by the rearranged string.
   - If the string `s` consists of only one unique character, it prints "NO".

### Issues:
- **Redundant Third Attempt:**
  - The third attempt to rearrange the string is redundant because it is the same as the first attempt. This does not affect the correctness of the program, but it is unnecessary.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the string `s` consists of only one unique character by printing "NO".
  - For strings with more than one unique character, the program attempts to rearrange the string in a way that ensures the new string is different from the original. This is generally correct, but it might not always produce the most optimal or diverse rearrangement.

### Conclusion:
- The program is logically correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description. It ensures that if a string can be rearranged to be different from the original, it will output "YES" followed by a valid rearranged string. If the string cannot be rearranged, it correctly outputs "NO".

### Correctness:
**True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem and handles all edge cases correctly.
