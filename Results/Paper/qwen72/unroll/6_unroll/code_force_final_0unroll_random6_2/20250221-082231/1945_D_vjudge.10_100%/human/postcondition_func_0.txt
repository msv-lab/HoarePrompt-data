The function `func_1` accepts an integer `pergunta` representing the number of test cases, two lists of integers `a` and `b` of length `n`, and two integers `n` and `m` with constraints 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000. It processes the lists `a` and `b` and updates `pergunta` to the minimum value between the initial `pergunta` and the sum of the minimum values of `a[i]` and `x` for the first `m` elements of the list `a`, starting from the end. Here, `x` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all elements from the end of the list to the beginning. The function then prints the final value of `pergunta`. The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
