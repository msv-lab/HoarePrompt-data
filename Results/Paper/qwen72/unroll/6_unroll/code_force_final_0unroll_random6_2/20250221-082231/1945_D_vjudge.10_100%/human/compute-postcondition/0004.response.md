The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `pergunta`: an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 <= pergunta <= 10^4.
- `a` and `b`: lists of integers of length n, where each element a_i and b_i satisfies 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.
- `n` and `m`: integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. However, based on the constraints and the typical behavior of such functions, it is likely that the function processes the lists `a` and `b` in some way for each test case and returns a result that depends on the values of `n` and `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `pergunta` representing the number of test cases, two lists of integers `a` and `b` of length `n`, and two integers `n` and `m` with constraints 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000. It processes the lists `a` and `b` for each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
