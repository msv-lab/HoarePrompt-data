pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), b is a list of n integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), n is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
