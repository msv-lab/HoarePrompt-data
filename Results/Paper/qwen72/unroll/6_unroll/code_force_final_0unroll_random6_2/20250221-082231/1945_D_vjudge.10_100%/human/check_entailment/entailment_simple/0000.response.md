Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly initializes the number of test cases and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `n` and the maximum allowable final position `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the initial value of `pergunta` set to infinity (`float('inf')`), which is a good starting point for finding the minimum cost.

3. **Loop and Cost Calculation**:
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive), which means it processes the queue from the end to the beginning.
   - Inside the loop, if the current index `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of the current `pergunta` and the sum of `x` and `a[i]`. This is correct because Kirill can only bribe people to move to positions `j` where `j < i` and `j < m`.
   - The variable `x` is updated to be the sum of `x` and the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is correct because Kirill will pay the minimum of `a[i]` or `b[i]` for each person he bribes to move past.

4. **Output**: After the loop, the program prints the value of `pergunta`, which should be the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic inside the loop:

- The line `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])` should be `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i] + sum(b[j] for j in range(i + 1, m)))` to correctly account for the additional cost of bribing people between positions `i` and `m`.

The current implementation does not correctly account for the additional `b[k]` costs for each `k` such that `j < k < i`. This means that the program might not compute the correct minimum cost in all cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the missing summation of `b[k]` costs.

Correctness: **False**
