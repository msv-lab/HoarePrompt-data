Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation**: The program attempts to simulate the operation of splitting elements that are greater than 10. It iterates through the array and checks if the current element is less than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than 10. If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array. However, this approach is flawed because it only performs the operation once per test case, and it does not handle the possibility of multiple operations being required to sort the array.

3. **Sorting Check**: After potentially performing the operation, the program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to a sorted version of itself using the `func_1` function. This part of the program is correct in terms of checking if the array is sorted.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already sorted, the program will correctly output `Yes`.
   - If the array contains elements that are not greater than 10, the program will not attempt to split them, which is correct according to the problem description.
   - The program does not handle the case where the array might need multiple operations to become sorted. For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. After the first operation, it becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, which is still not sorted. The program does not attempt further operations to split `28` into `2` and `8`, and then `5` into `5` (which would result in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]` and then `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`).

5. **Multiple Operations**: The problem description allows for the operation to be performed any number of times. The current implementation only performs the operation once, which means it might fail to sort the array if multiple operations are required. This is a significant flaw in the program.

6. **Correct Solution**: To correctly solve the problem, the program should continue performing the operation until no more elements can be split or the array is sorted. This can be achieved by using a loop that keeps track of whether any changes were made in the current iteration. For example, a while loop that continues as long as changes are being made would be more appropriate.

Given these points, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the possibility of multiple operations being required to sort the array. The original assessment correctly identified this issue.

Final: **False**
