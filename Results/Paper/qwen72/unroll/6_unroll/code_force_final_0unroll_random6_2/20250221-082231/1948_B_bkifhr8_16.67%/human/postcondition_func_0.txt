The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of `lst` is between 2 and 50 inclusive. It returns `True` if the list `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.
