Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation**: The program attempts to simulate the operation of splitting elements that are greater than 10. It iterates through the array and checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than 10. If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.

3. **Sorting Check**: After potentially performing the operation, the program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to a sorted version of itself using the `func_1` function.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already sorted, the program will correctly output `Yes`.
   - If the array contains elements that are not greater than 10, the program will not attempt to split them, which is correct according to the problem description.
   - The program does not handle the case where the array might need multiple operations to become sorted. It only performs the operation once, which is incorrect.

5. **Multiple Operations**: The problem description allows for the operation to be performed any number of times. The current implementation only performs the operation once, which means it might fail to sort the array if multiple operations are required. For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. After the first operation, it becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, which is still not sorted. The program does not attempt further operations to split `28` into `2` and `8`.

6. **Correct Solution**: To correctly solve the problem, the program should continue performing the operation until no more elements can be split or the array is sorted. This can be achieved by using a loop that keeps track of whether any changes were made in the current iteration.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the possibility of multiple operations being required to sort the array.

Correctness: **False**
