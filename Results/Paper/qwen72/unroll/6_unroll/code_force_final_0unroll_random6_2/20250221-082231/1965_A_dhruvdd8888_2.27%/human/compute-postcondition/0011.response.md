The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `nums`. The loop will execute if `len(nums) - 2` is greater than 0. Given that the length of `nums` is greater than 3, the loop will indeed execute. The initial state of `i` is 0, and `nums` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `piles` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 at the beginning and has at least 4 elements, `cd` is 0, `i` is 0**
