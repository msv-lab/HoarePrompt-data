Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
Alice
```

Actual Output:
```
Bob
```

The program incorrectly determines the winner as "Bob" for this input. The correct logic should consider the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes, but the implementation in the program is incorrect. The program should correctly identify that Alice can win by removing 1 stone from each pile on her first turn, leaving Bob with no valid moves. However, the program incorrectly classifies this case as a win for Bob.
