The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `piles`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and `piles` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The function prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on certain conditions and returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `piles`. It prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the game's conditions and always returns `None`.**
