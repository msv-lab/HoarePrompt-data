The code snippet `nums = set(input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts this list into a set, assigning it to the variable `nums`. This means `nums` now contains unique elements from the input line, each element being a string.

Output State: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), piles is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `nums` is a set of unique strings from the input.**
