Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the size of a chessboard and returns the value of `dp[n]`, which is the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an n x n chessboard, modulo (7 + 10^9). The function maintains a rolling list `dp` of the last two computed values to achieve this. **
