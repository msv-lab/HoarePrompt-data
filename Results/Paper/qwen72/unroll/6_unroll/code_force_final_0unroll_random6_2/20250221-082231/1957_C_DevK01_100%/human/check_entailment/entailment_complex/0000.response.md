Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played. It also reads the `k` moves and processes them to update the size of the available board for further moves.

2. **Move Processing**: The program correctly processes each move. If the move is on a diagonal (i.e., `a == b`), it reduces `n` by 1, indicating that one row and one column are now occupied. If the move is not on a diagonal, it reduces `n` by 2, indicating that both the row and the column are now occupied.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Function**: The function `func_1` is designed to compute the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` chessboard, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The DP approach is correct:
   - `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` are initialized to 1, which is correct because there is exactly one way to place 0 or 1 rook on a board.
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the program computes the number of ways to place `i` rooks on an `i x i` board using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]
     \]
     This formula accounts for:
     - Placing a rook in a new row and column, which leaves the problem of placing `i-1` rooks on an `(i-1) x (i-1)` board (`dp[i-1]`).
     - Placing a rook in a new row and column, and then placing another rook in one of the `2 * (i-1)` positions that are not in the same row or column as the first rook, which leaves the problem of placing `i-2` rooks on an `(i-2) x (i-2)` board (`2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]`).

4. **Rolling DP List**: The program uses a rolling list `dp` to keep track of the last two values, which is an efficient way to manage memory and avoid storing the entire DP array.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The program correctly applies the modulo operation to ensure that the result does not overflow and is within the required range.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

However, there is a small issue in the function `func_1`:
- The function should return `dp[-1]` (which is `dp[n]`), but the comment incorrectly states that it returns `dp[n-1]`. This is a minor documentation error but does not affect the correctness of the program.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in its logic and implementation.

Correctness: **True**
