Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the chessboard size `n` is 1 and `k` is 0. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1 and `k` is 0, there is only one possible final configuration, which is the empty board. However, the function `func_1` will return 1, which is incorrect because the only valid configuration is the empty board, and no rooks can be placed on a 1x1 board without violating the rules. The program should return 1 for this case, but it does not.
