### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case within a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the list `lst` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the List**:
   - The list `lst` is split into two halves: `lft` and `rgt`. This is done correctly using slicing.

3. **Sorting**:
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. This is necessary to identify duplicate elements and single elements easily.

4. **Identifying Duplicates and Singles**:
   - The function uses a loop to identify duplicate elements in `lft` and `rgt` and appends them to `ldb` and `rdb` respectively.
   - It also identifies single elements in `lft` and appends them to `sng`.

5. **Printing the Results**:
   - The function prints pairs of duplicate elements from `ldb` and `rdb` up to `k` elements.
   - If there are not enough pairs of duplicates, it prints single elements from `sng` to ensure the total number of elements printed is `2k`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `k` is 1 by printing pairs of duplicates and single elements.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is greater than 1 by ensuring that the total number of elements printed is `2k`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Handling of Single Elements**:
  - The function appends single elements to `sng` only from `lft`, but it should also consider single elements from `rgt` to ensure that the XOR condition is met.
  - The logic for appending single elements to `sng` is flawed. The condition `elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

- **XOR Condition**:
  - The function does not explicitly check if the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. It relies on the assumption that the elements are chosen correctly, but this is not guaranteed by the current logic.

### Correctness:
- The function does not correctly handle the XOR condition for all cases, especially when there are single elements in both halves.
- The logic for identifying and printing single elements is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The function needs to be revised to correctly handle the XOR condition and to properly identify and print single elements from both halves of the list.
