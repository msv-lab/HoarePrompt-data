Reasoning:  
The program provided attempts to solve the problem by splitting the input array `a` into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`, and then sorting these halves. It then tries to form the arrays `l` and `r` by selecting pairs of duplicate elements from each half and, if necessary, single elements from the first half to meet the length requirement of `2k`. However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Single Elements**: The program incorrectly handles single elements. The logic for appending single elements to `sng` is flawed because it only checks if the current element is not equal to the next element, which can lead to missing some single elements or incorrectly identifying some as single.

2. **Incorrect Output of Elements**: The program prints elements directly without forming the arrays `l` and `r` properly. This can lead to incorrect output formats, especially if the number of elements printed does not match the required `2k` length.

3. **XOR Condition**: The program does not explicitly check if the XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of the elements in `r`. This is a critical part of the problem, and the program should ensure this condition is met.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `k` is 1 or when the input array has a specific pattern that might not be straightforward to split into pairs.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
