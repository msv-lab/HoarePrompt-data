The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a pair of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, the function splits the list `a` into two halves, sorts them, and then prints pairs of duplicate elements from each half and single elements from the first half, up to `k` elements in total for each half. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the program ends.
