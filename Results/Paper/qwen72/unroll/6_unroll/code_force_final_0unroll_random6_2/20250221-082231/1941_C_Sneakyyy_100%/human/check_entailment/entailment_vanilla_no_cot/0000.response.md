Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in how the program attempts to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the program only increments `i` by 3 when it finds a substring "map" or "pie", and it only increments `ans` by 1. This means that the program is only counting the number of times it finds the substrings "map" or "pie", but it does not actually ensure that the minimum number of characters are removed to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the string "mmapnapie". The program will find the substring "map" at the start and increment `i` by 3, then it will find the substring "pie" and increment `i` by 3 again. However, the correct solution should be to remove the 4th and 9th characters to make the string beautiful, which requires removing 2 characters, not 2 substrings.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the positions of the substrings "map" and "pie" and determine the minimum number of deletions required to avoid these substrings. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(s) - 2:
            if s[i:i + 3] == 'map' or s[i:i + 3] == 'pie':
                ans += 1
                i += 3
            else:
                i += 1
        # Check for overlapping cases
        for i in range(len(s) - 2):
            if s[i:i + 3] == 'map' or s[i:i + 3] == 'pie':
                ans += 1
        print(ans)

# Example usage
# func()
```

However, this approach is still not optimal. A more efficient and correct approach would be to use dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to count the minimum deletions required. Here is a more efficient solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        # Initialize the dp array
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        # Fill the dp array
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i + 1] = dp[i] + 1
            if i < n - 2 and (s[i:i + 3] == 'map' or s[i:i + 3] == 'pie'):
                dp[i + 3] = min(dp[i + 3], dp[i])
            if i < n - 1 and (s[i:i + 2] == 'ma' or s[i:i + 2] == 'pi'):
                dp[i + 2] = min(dp[i + 2], dp[i])
            if s[i] == 'm' or s[i] == 'p':
                dp[i + 1] = min(dp[i + 1], dp[i])
        
        # The answer is the total length minus the maximum length of a beautiful substring
        print(n - dp[n])

# Example usage
# func()
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful up to each position. It correctly handles overlapping cases and ensures the minimum number of deletions.
