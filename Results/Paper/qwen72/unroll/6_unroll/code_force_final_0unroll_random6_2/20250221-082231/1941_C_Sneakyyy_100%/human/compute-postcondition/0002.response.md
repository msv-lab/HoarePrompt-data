The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, representing the length of the string `s`. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `s`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided.**
