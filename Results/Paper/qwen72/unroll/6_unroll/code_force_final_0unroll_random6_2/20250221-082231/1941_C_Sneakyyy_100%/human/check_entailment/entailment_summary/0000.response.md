Reasoning:  
The program aims to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful by removing occurrences of the substrings "map" or "pie". However, the program's approach is flawed. It increments the count `ans` by 1 and the index `i` by 3 whenever it finds a substring "map" or "pie". This means that for each occurrence of "map" or "pie", it only counts one deletion, which is incorrect because removing one character from "map" or "pie" can still leave a valid substring. For example, if the string is "mmapnapie", the program will only count 2 deletions, but the correct answer is 2 (removing the 4th and 9th characters).

Additionally, the program does not handle overlapping occurrences of "map" or "pie" correctly. For example, in the string "mappppie", the program will only count 2 deletions, but the correct answer is 2 (removing the 4th and 9th characters).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify all occurrences of "map" and "pie".
2. Ensure that overlapping occurrences are handled correctly.
3. Count the minimum number of characters to delete to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

Given the current implementation, the program does not meet these requirements and will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
