Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then calculates and prints the maximum length of a subarray within `a` that does not contain consecutive equal elements. If the entire array consists of equal elements, it prints 0. The function does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, or `a` and processes all test cases provided. **
