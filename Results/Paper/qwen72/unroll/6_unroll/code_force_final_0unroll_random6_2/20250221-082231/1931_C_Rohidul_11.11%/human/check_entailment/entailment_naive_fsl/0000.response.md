Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has multiple different values, but the most frequent value is not at the beginning or the end of the array. For example, consider the input:

```
1
7
4 3 2 7 1 1 3
```

The expected output is 6, because the optimal solution is to set the values from index 0 to 5 to 1, which costs 6 burles. However, the program will output 4, which is incorrect. The program fails to consider the most frequent value in the array and the cost to make all elements equal to that value.
