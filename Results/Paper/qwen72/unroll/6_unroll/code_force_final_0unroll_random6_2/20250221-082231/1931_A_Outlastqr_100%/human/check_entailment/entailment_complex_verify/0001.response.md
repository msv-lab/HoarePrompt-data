### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that sums to a given integer \( n \).
   - The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26.
   - The sum of the indices of the three letters should equal \( n \).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code uses a loop to handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and determines the lexicographically smallest word that sums to \( n \).

3. **Breaking Down the Conditions:**
   - **If \( n > 52 \):**
     - The maximum sum of two letters is 52 (26 + 26). Therefore, if \( n > 52 \), the first letter must be at least 'r' (18th letter) to ensure the sum can be achieved.
     - The code adds the letter corresponding to \( n - 53 \) (since 'r' is the 18th letter, \( n - 53 \) gives the correct index) followed by 'zz'.
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest by using the smallest possible first letter and 'zz' for the remaining two letters.
     - **Example:** For \( n = 70 \), \( 70 - 53 = 17 \), so the word is 'rzz' (18 + 26 + 26 = 70).

   - **If \( 27 < n \leq 52 \):**
     - The maximum sum of one letter is 26. Therefore, if \( 27 < n \leq 52 \), the first letter must be 'a' and the second letter must be at least 'a' to ensure the sum can be achieved.
     - The code adds 'a' followed by the letter corresponding to \( n - 28 \) (since 'a' is the 1st letter, \( n - 28 \) gives the correct index) and 'z'.
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest by using 'a' as the first letter and the smallest possible second letter followed by 'z'.
     - **Example:** For \( n = 50 \), \( 50 - 28 = 22 \), so the word is 'avz' (1 + 22 + 26 = 50).

   - **If \( n == 27 \):**
     - The sum 27 can be achieved with the word 'aay' (1 + 1 + 25).
     - The code correctly handles this special case by setting the word to 'aay'.
     - **Example:** For \( n = 27 \), the word is 'aay' (1 + 1 + 25 = 27).

   - **If \( n \leq 26 \):**
     - The sum \( n \) can be achieved with the word 'aa' followed by the letter corresponding to \( n - 3 \) (since 'a' is the 1st letter, \( n - 3 \) gives the correct index).
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest by using 'aa' as the first two letters and the smallest possible third letter.
     - **Example:** For \( n = 5 \), \( 5 - 3 = 2 \), so the word is 'aac' (1 + 1 + 3 = 5).

4. **Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles all the edge cases and the general cases.
   - The conditions and logic used to construct the word are sound and ensure the lexicographically smallest word is generated.
   - The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the code.
