Output State: **`lst` is a defaultdict of type list where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the nodes connected to the key node by an edge. The length of the list for each key will be the number of edges connected to that node, which is `x - 1` for each node involved in the loop. The other variables `n`, `u1`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. `s` is True.**
