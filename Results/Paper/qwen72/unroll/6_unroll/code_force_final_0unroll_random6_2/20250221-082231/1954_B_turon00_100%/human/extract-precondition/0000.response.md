Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should take a list of integers `a` as input, where `a` is a beautiful array, and an integer `n` representing the length of the array `a` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5). Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, which implies that it might need to take an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, the array `a` and its length `n`. However, the function definition should be corrected to include these parameters.**
