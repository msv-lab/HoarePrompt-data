The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of a list of integers `a`. It then processes the list `a` to find the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element in `a`. If the length `n` is 1 or all elements in `a` are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count found. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` will have been updated according to the input and the logic of the function.
