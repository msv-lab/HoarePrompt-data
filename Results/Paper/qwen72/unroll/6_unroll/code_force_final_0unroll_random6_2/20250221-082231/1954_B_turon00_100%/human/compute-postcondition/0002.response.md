Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, each time processing a list of integers `a` of length `n`. For each test case, the loop will print either `-1` if `n` is 1 or if all elements in `a` are the same, or the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element in `a`. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` will have been updated according to the logic of the loop, but their final values will depend on the input provided during the execution.**
