Reasoning:  
The game's outcome can be determined by the parity (even or odd) of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key observation is that each player can either swap wallets or not, and then must remove one coin from their wallet. The game continues until a player is unable to make a move, which happens when their wallet is empty.

- If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, the game will always end with both wallets having an even number of coins. This means that both players will always have a coin to remove after each turn, and the game will continue until both wallets are empty. Since Alice makes the first move, she will be the one to make the last move when both wallets have 1 coin each, and Bob will be unable to make a move after that, making Bob the winner.
- If the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, the game will end with one wallet having an odd number of coins and the other having an even number of coins. This means that the player whose wallet has an odd number of coins will always be able to make the last move, and the other player will be unable to make a move after that. Since Alice starts the game, if the sum is odd, she will be the one to make the last move and win.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using the bitwise AND operator (`&`). If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'; if the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
