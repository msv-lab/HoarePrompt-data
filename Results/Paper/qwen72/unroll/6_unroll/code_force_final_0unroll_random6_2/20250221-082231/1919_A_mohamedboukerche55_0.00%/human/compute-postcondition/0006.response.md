Postcondition: ***The values of `a` and `b` will be overwritten with the last input values for `a` and `b` from the loop, and `i` will be equal to `t-1` (where `t` is the number of test cases). The initial values of `a` and `b` provided before the loop will be lost. Additionally, if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the sum of `a` and `b` is divisible by 2. Otherwise, the sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2.***
