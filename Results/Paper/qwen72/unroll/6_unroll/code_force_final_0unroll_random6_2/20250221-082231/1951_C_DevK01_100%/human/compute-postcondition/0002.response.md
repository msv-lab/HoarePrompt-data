Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each iteration, the variable `cost` is calculated and printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The list `M` is sorted and potentially modified by the `pop` operation, but its state is reset in each iteration. The variables `L`, `N`, `q`, `w`, and `mu` are local to the loop and do not persist between iterations.**
