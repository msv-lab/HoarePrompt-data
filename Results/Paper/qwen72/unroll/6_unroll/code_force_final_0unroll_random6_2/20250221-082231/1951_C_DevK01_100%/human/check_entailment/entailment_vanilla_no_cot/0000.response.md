Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost:**
   - The program calculates the cost using a formula that does not accurately reflect the problem's constraints. Specifically, the formula `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` and the subsequent adjustments do not correctly account for the increasing prices after each purchase.

2. **Handling of Remaining Tickets:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the remaining tickets after the initial purchase. It pops the last element from the sorted list and calculates the cost for the remaining tickets, but this does not consider the increasing prices correctly.

3. **Logic for Purchasing Tickets:**
   - The program does not properly simulate the process of purchasing tickets and updating the prices for subsequent days. It should keep track of the number of tickets purchased each day and adjust the prices accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_buy_tickets():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the prices in ascending order
        prices.sort()
        
        # Initialize the total cost
        total_cost = 0
        
        # Initialize the number of tickets bought
        tickets_bought = 0
        
        # Initialize the day counter
        day = 0
        
        while tickets_bought < k:
            # Determine the number of tickets to buy on this day
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
            
            # Calculate the cost for this day
            total_cost += prices[day] * tickets_to_buy
            
            # Update the number of tickets bought
            tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
            
            # Update the prices for subsequent days
            for i in range(day + 1, n):
                prices[i] += tickets_to_buy
            
            # Move to the next day
            day += 1
        
        print(total_cost)

min_cost_to_buy_tickets()
```

This corrected version correctly simulates the process of buying tickets each day and updating the prices for subsequent days. It ensures that the total cost is calculated accurately based on the problem's constraints.
