Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` representing the number of trailing zeros in a list of integers. It returns the number of trailing zeros in the list, which is the count of zeros at the end of the list. The input `num` is not modified by the function. **

However, based on the provided code, it seems there is a mismatch between the function's actual behavior and the described input. The function is designed to work with a list of integers, not an integer representing the number of test cases. The function counts the trailing zeros in the list and returns this count. The input list remains unchanged. 

Given the actual code, here is the corrected functionality:
