Precondition: **num is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^6, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**
