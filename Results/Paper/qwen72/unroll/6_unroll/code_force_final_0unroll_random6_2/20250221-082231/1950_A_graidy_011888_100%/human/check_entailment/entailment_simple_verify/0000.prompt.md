You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates t times, where t is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each iteration, the function receives three digits a, b, and c as input, where each digit is an integer (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop will print 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each iteration based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` provided during that iteration. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated with the new input values for each iteration, and `i` will increment from 0 to `n-1`. After the loop completes, the final value of `i` will be `n-1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. It reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by checking if the three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, and prints the appropriate result. The conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b and b > c`) are correctly implemented, and the else clause covers all other cases, ensuring that the program will output "NONE" for any input that does not satisfy the conditions for a stair or a peak. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential inputs.
