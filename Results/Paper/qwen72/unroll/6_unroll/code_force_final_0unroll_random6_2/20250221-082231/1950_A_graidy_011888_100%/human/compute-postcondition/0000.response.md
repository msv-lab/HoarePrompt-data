The code snippet `n = int(input())` will prompt the user to input a value, which is then converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that the function should be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each iteration, the function receives three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each digit is an integer (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9). However, this code snippet does not call the function or handle the loop; it only assigns a new value to `n`.

Output State: **The function should be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each iteration, the function receives three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each digit is an integer (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9). `n` is an input integer.**
