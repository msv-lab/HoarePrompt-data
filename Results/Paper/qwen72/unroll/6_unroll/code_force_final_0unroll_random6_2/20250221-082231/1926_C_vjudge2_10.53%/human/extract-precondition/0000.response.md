Precondition: **The function should accept an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should accept two parameters: one for the number of test cases and another for the list of integers n for each test case. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, n_list):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and n_list is a list of t integers where each integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) represents the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case.**
