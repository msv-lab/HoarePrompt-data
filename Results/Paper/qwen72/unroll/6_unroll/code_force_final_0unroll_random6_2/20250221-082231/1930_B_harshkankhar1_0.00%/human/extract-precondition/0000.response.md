It appears there is a mismatch in the function definition provided and the problem description. The problem description suggests that the function should take an integer `n` as an input, but the function definition does not include any parameters. Assuming the function definition should match the problem description, here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def func_1(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**
