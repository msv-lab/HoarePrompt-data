Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), but the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are now in reverse order.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices in the list `a`.
- The elements at odd indices remain unchanged.
- For example, if `n` is 5, `a` initially is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. After executing the code, `a` becomes `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.
- The value of `n` remains the same, and the list `a` still contains integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), but the elements at even indices are reversed.
