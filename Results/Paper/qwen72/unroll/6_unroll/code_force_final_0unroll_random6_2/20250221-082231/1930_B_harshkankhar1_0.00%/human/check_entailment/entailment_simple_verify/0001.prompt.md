You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(a)
    #This is printed: [n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., 1] (where n is the value of `n` and the list is structured such that elements at even indices are in reverse order while elements at odd indices remain in their original positions)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a permutation of length \( n \) such that for any two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)), it should not be the case that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and generates a list \( a \) containing the integers from 1 to \( n \) in ascending order.
   - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list \( a \).
   - Finally, it prints the modified list \( a \).

3. **Checking the Permutation Validity:**
   - The list \( a \) is initially a permutation of length \( n \) with elements from 1 to \( n \).
   - Reversing the elements at even indices means that the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, etc., are reversed.
   - This operation ensures that the elements at even indices are no longer in their original order, which can help in breaking the divisibility condition.

4. **Verifying the Divisibility Condition:**
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the elements at these positions are not in a simple ascending or descending order.
   - This helps in breaking the pattern where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) for any \( i \) and \( j \).

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For \( n = 4 \), the initial list is \( [1, 2, 3, 4] \).
   - After reversing the elements at even indices, the list becomes \( [3, 2, 1, 4] \).
   - Check the divisibility condition:
     - \( p_1 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 1 \).
     - \( p_2 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 4 \).
     - \( p_3 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_1 = 3 \).
     - \( p_4 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 2 \).
   - This permutation is valid.

   - For \( n = 3 \), the initial list is \( [1, 2, 3] \).
   - After reversing the elements at even indices, the list remains \( [1, 2, 3] \) because there is only one even index (0).
   - Check the divisibility condition:
     - \( p_1 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 3 \).
     - \( p_2 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 4 \) (since \( p_4 \) does not exist).
   - This permutation is valid.

6. **General Case:**
   - For any \( n \), the program ensures that the elements at even indices are reversed, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.
   - The program guarantees that the output is a permutation of length \( n \) and meets the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
