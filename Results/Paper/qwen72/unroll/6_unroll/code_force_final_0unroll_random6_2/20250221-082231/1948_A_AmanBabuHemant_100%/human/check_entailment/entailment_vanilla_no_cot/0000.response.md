Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Condition**: The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters come in pairs (e.g., "AA", "BB").

3. **String Construction**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' is a special character because it is equal to its neighbor 'A'. The string `s` will have exactly `n` special characters.

4. **Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'. However, since `n` is at most 50, the length of `s` will never exceed 150 (since `n // 2 * 3` is at most 75 * 3 = 150), so this check is always satisfied.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints the required output for each test case.

Given the constraints and the logic, the program will always produce the correct output for the given problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
