### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required in the string.

2. **Special Character Condition:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2:`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because special characters must come in pairs (e.g., AA, BB, etc.).

3. **String Construction:**
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' is a special character because it is equal to its neighbor 'A', and each 'B' is not a special character because it is not equal to its neighbors.
   - The length of the string `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). This is correct because the maximum length of `s` is `3 * 25 = 75`, which is well within the limit of 200.

4. **Output:**
   - If the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200, the program prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`.
   - If the length of the string `s` exceeds 200, the program prints 'NO'. However, given the constraints, this condition will never be true because the maximum length of `s` is `3 * 25 = 75`, which is well within the limit of 200.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks the conditions, and constructs the string as required. It also ensures that the string length does not exceed 200, which is always true given the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
