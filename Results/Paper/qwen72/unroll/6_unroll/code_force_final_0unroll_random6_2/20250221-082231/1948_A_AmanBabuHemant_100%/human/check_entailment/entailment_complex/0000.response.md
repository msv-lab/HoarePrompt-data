### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and ensures that `1 <= t <= 50`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and ensures that `1 <= n <= 50`.

2. **Odd `n` Check**:
   - If `n` is odd, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. Each special character must be part of a pair, and thus the number of special characters must be even.

3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is even, the function constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern 'AAB' `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' in 'AAB' is a special character because it is equal to one of its neighbors.
   - The length of the string `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which simplifies to `3 * n / 2`. For `1 <= n <= 50`, the maximum length of `s` is `3 * 50 / 2 = 75`, which is well within the limit of 200.

4. **Output**:
   - If the length of `s` is less than 200, the function prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. This is correct because the string `s` will always have exactly `n` special characters and will always be within the length limit.
   - If the length of `s` is 200 or more, the function prints 'NO'. However, this condition will never be met because the maximum length of `s` is 75, which is less than 200.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the requirements of the problem description. It correctly identifies when an odd `n` is provided and prints 'NO'. For even `n`, it constructs a valid string with exactly `n` special characters and ensures that the string length is within the specified limit.

### Correctness:
**True**
