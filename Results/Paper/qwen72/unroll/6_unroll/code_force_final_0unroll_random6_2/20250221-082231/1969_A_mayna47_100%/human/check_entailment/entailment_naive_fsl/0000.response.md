Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it prints `2` as soon as it finds a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and then immediately returns, without considering other cases where the minimum number of invitations might be greater than 2 but still valid. For example, consider the input:

```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

The program will output:

```
2
2
2
```

However, the correct output for the second test case should be `3` because there is no pair of friends who are each other's best friends, and the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3. The program fails to correctly handle this case.
