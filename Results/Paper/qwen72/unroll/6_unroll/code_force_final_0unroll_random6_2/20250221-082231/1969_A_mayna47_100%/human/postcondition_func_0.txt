The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user and a list of `n` integers from the user. It then checks if for any index `i` in the range `[1, n]`, the value at `v[v[i]]` equals `i`. If such an index is found, the function prints `2` and returns. If no such index is found, the function prints `3` and returns. The function does not return any value, and it does not modify the input parameters `t`, `n`, or `p` (though `p` is not used in the function). The final state of the program is that the function has printed either `2` or `3` and has returned.
