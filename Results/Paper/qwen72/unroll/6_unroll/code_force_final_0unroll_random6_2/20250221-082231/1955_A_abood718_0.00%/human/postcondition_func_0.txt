The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. Based on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`, the function prints one or two lines of output for each test case. If `B * 2 < C`, it prints `A * B`. If `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`. If `A` is odd, it prints `A // 2` followed by `(A // 2) * C + B`. The function does not return any value. The input variables `t`, `A`, `B`, and `C` are consumed during the function execution and are not modified.
