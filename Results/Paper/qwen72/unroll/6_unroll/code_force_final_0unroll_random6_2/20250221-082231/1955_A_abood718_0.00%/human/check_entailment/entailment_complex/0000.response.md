Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the promotion price for two yogurts, respectively.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: `if B * 2 < C` checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion price. If true, the function prints `A * B`, which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - **Condition 2**: `elif A % 2 == 0` checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If true, the function prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought using the promotion price.
   - **Condition 3**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the function calculates `X = A // 2` (the number of pairs of yogurts) and prints `X * C + B` (the cost of buying `X` pairs at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price).

3. **Output**:
   - For the first test case (`2 5 9`), the function correctly prints `9` because `2 * 5 < 9` is false, and `2` is even, so `2 * 9 / 2 = 9`.
   - For the second test case (`3 5 9`), the function correctly prints `14` because `2 * 5 < 9` is false, and `3` is odd, so `1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - For the third test case (`3 5 11`), the function correctly prints `15` because `2 * 5 < 11` is true, so `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - For the fourth test case (`4 5 11`), the function correctly prints `20` because `2 * 5 < 11` is true, so `4 * 5 = 20`.

4. **Issues**:
   - The function prints an extra line `X` when `A` is odd, which is not part of the required output. This is incorrect and will result in additional, unnecessary output lines.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the extra print statement when `A` is odd.

Correctness: **False**
