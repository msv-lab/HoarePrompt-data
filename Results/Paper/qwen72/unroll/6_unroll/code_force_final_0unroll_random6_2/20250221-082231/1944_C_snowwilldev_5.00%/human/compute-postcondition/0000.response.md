The objects in the loop head are `tc` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that the number of test cases `t` is at least 1, and `tc` is initialized to 0. The input must be a valid integer that represents the number of test cases, and it must be within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4, `tc` is 0, and the input is a valid integer representing `t`**
