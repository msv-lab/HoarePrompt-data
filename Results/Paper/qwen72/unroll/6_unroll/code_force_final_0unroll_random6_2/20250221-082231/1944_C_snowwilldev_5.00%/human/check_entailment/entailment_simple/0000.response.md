### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `N` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - The variable `t` is used to track the number of unique integers that appear exactly once in `a`.
   - The loop iterates through the integers from 0 to `N-1` and checks:
     - If the integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`, it increments `t`.
     - If `t` reaches 2 or if the integer `i` is missing from `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice and Bob will play optimally. Alice will try to pick elements that are necessary to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to pick elements that prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.
   - The key insight is that the MEX of the final array `c` will be the smallest integer that either:
     - Appears exactly once in `a` (since Alice will pick it, and Bob will pick another element, making it impossible for Alice to pick it again).
     - Is missing from `a` (since neither Alice nor Bob can pick it).

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using `cnt`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from 0 to `N-1` and checks the conditions to determine the MEX.
   - The condition `if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0` ensures that the program prints the first integer that either:
     - Appears exactly once (incrementing `t` each time such an integer is found).
     - Is missing from `a`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `a` contains all integers from 0 to `N-1` (in which case the MEX is `N`).
   - It also handles the case where `a` contains no unique elements (in which case the MEX is 0).

6. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case as described.
   - The output is the MEX for each test case, which is printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the MEX of the final array `c` when both players play optimally. The conditions and the loop structure are appropriate for the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
