### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read lines from the input, which is a common and efficient way to handle input in Python, especially for large inputs.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to parse the input. `func_1` reads a line and strips the newline character, `func_2` converts the line to an integer, and `func_3` splits the line into a list of integers.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.

3. **Initial Setup:**
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.

4. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program iterates over the `m` throws.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set.
   - The use of `% n` ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly.

5. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set, as player `0` is the same as player `n` in a 1-indexed circle.
   - It then prints the number of players in the set and the sorted list of player numbers.

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles the problem as described. It correctly parses the input, processes each throw, and updates the set of possible positions. The final adjustments to handle the 1-indexed circle are also correct. The output format matches the problem description, and the program ensures that all possible positions are considered.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
