Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` is a set containing all unique values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` and for each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`. If `0` is in the initial `ans`, `0` is excluded from the set, and `n` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as described in the precondition.***
