The provided function `func_2` does not directly relate to the problem description and does not use any of the variables mentioned in the problem. Therefore, it is not possible to extract a precondition based on the variables in the function signature and the problem context. However, if we assume that `func_1` and `func_2` are part of a larger solution, we can infer that `func_2` might be used to process an integer value returned by `func_1`.

Since the function signature of `func_2` does not include any parameters, the precondition is not applicable to the variables in the function signature. If you intended to provide a different function that directly relates to the problem, please provide the correct function, and I will be able to extract the precondition accordingly.
