To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
   - `ans` is a set containing all unique values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` and for each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`.
   - If `0` is in the initial `ans`, `0` is excluded from the set, and `n` is added to `ans`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as described in the precondition.

2. **Understanding the Operations:**
   - The operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` are performed for each `q` in the initial `ans` and for each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`.
   - The results of these operations are added to the set `ans`, ensuring that only unique values are included.
   - If `0` is in the initial `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to the set.

3. **Determining the Final State of `ans`:**
   - The exact values in `ans` depend on the initial values of `ans` and the values returned by `func_1()`.
   - However, the key point is that `ans` will contain unique values generated by the operations, and if `0` is initially in `ans`, it will be replaced by `n`.

4. **Calculating the Length of `ans`:**
   - The length of `ans` will be the number of unique values in the set after performing the operations and applying the condition to exclude `0` and include `n` if necessary.

Since the exact initial values of `ans` and the values returned by `func_1()` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the operations and conditions given.

Output: **len(ans) (where ans is a set containing all unique values generated by the operations (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for each q in the initial ans and for each r and c returned by func_1(), with 0 excluded and n added if 0 is initially in ans)**
