### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This is used to read the input values.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer.
   - `func_3` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns this list. This is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_4` processes each test case. It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`, and then reads the throw distances and directions using `func_1`.

2. **Processing the Throws:**
   - `func_4` initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the result of `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the result of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - After processing all possible throws for the current set `ans`, it updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `0` is present in the set `ans` after all throws, it is removed, and `n` is added to the set. This is because player `0` does not exist, and player `n` is the same as player `1` in a circular arrangement.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the number of players who could have the ball at the end of the game.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these player numbers.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`:**
  - These functions are straightforward and correctly handle the input as described in the problem. They read the necessary values and convert them to the appropriate types.

- **Correctness of `func_4`:**
  - The function correctly initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
  - It correctly processes each throw by considering both possible directions (clockwise and counterclockwise) when the direction is unknown ('?').
  - The use of modulo `n` ensures that the player numbers wrap around correctly in a circular arrangement.
  - The edge case where `0` is in the set is handled correctly by removing `0` and adding `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the input, processes the throws, and outputs the correct result for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
