t is an integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 \le n \le 1000, m is an integer such that 1 \le m \le 1000, x is an integer such that 1 \le x \le n, r_i is an integer such that 1 \le r_i \le n - 1 for each 1 \le i \le m, and c_i is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?' for each 1 \le i \le m. The sum of n \cdot m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
