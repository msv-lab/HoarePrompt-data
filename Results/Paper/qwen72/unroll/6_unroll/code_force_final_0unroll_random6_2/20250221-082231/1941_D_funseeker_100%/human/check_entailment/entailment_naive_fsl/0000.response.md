Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the initial player is `n` and a counterclockwise throw is made. Specifically, the line `(q - r) % n` can result in a negative number, which is then taken modulo `n`, leading to incorrect results. For example, if `n = 5`, `x = 5`, and the first throw is `1 1`, the program will incorrectly calculate the new position as `4` instead of `5`.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the counterclockwise calculation wraps around correctly. This can be done by adding `n` to the result of the subtraction before taking the modulo, like `(q - r + n) % n`. This ensures that the result is always a valid player number.
