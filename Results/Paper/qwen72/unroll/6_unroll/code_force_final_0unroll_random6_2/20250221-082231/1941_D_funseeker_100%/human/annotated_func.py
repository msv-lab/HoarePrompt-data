#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns the first line of input from the user, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns the first line of input from the user, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The provided function `func_2` does not directly relate to the problem description and does not use any of the variables mentioned in the problem. Therefore, it is not possible to extract a precondition based on the variables in the function signature and the problem context. However, if we assume that `func_1` and `func_2` are part of a larger solution, we can infer that `func_2` might be used to process an integer value returned by `func_1`.

Since the function signature of `func_2` does not include any parameters, the precondition is not applicable to the variables in the function signature. If you intended to provide a different function that directly relates to the problem, please provide the correct function, and I will be able to extract the precondition accordingly.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer value that is the result of calling `func_1()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is the result of calling `func_1()`. After the function concludes, the program state includes the integer value returned by `func_1()`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_1()` and converting each part into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers. This list is generated by splitting the string returned by `func_1` and converting each resulting substring into an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()

                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged, and `ans` is a set containing all unique values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` and for each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: *`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` is a set containing all unique values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` and for each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`. If `0` is in the initial `ans`, `0` is excluded from the set, and `n` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as described in the precondition.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where ans is a set containing all unique values generated by the operations (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for each q in the initial ans and for each r and c returned by func_1(), with 0 excluded and n added if 0 is initially in ans)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: sorted(ans) (where ans is the set containing all unique values generated by the operations (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for each q in the initial ans and for each r and c returned by func_1(), with 0 removed and n added if 0 was initially in ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It operates on three integer variables `n`, `m`, and `x` that are obtained from the function `func_3`, where `2 <= n <= 1000`, `1 <= m <= 1000`, and `1 <= x <= n`. The function generates a set `ans` of unique integers by performing a series of operations based on values returned by `func_1`. Specifically, for each of the `m` iterations, it adds and subtracts the integer `r` (obtained from `func_1`) to/from each element `q` in `ans`, modulo `n`, and includes the results in `ans` if certain conditions are met. After all iterations, if `0` is present in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to the set. The function then prints the size of the set `ans` and the sorted elements of `ans`.
