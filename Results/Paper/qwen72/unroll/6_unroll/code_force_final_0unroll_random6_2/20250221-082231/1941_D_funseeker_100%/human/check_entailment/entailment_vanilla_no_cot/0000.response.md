Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read input efficiently. `func_1` reads a line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. `func_2` converts the result of `func_1` to an integer. `func_3` splits the line and converts each element to an integer, returning a list.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main function `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x` to keep track of the possible players who could have the ball.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the new possible positions of the ball.
   - If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to be the set of all possible positions in `temp`.

3. **Adjusting for 1-based Indexing**:
   - Since the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, the program checks if 0 is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` to ensure the output is 1-based.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

The program correctly handles all the cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the possibility of unknown directions and the need to output the results in increasing order. Therefore, the program is correct.
