### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read lines from the input, which is a common and efficient way to handle input in Python, especially for large inputs.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to parse the input. `func_1` reads a line and strips the newline character, `func_2` converts the line to an integer, and `func_3` splits the line into a list of integers. This part is correct and efficient for the given problem constraints.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop. This is correct and follows the problem description.

3. **Initial Setup:**
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct as the ball starts with player `x`.

4. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program iterates over the `m` throws.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set.
   - The use of `% n` ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly. However, there is a potential issue with the modulo operation when `q - r` is negative. In Python, the modulo operation with a negative number can result in a negative value, which is not what we want for a 1-indexed circle. We need to ensure that the result is always a non-negative integer.

5. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set, as player `0` is the same as player `n` in a 1-indexed circle.
   - It then prints the number of players in the set and the sorted list of player numbers.
   - The final adjustments to handle the 1-indexed circle are correct, but the potential issue with the modulo operation in the processing throws step needs to be addressed.

### Potential Issue:
- The modulo operation `(q - r) % n` can result in a negative value if `q - r` is negative. This can be fixed by adding `n` to the result before applying the modulo operation, i.e., `((q - r) + n) % n`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

# Function 1:
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

# Function 3:
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

# Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r - 1) % n + 1)  # Adjust for 1-indexed circle
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add(((q - r + n - 1) % n + 1))  # Adjust for 1-indexed circle
        ans = temp
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))

# Main program
t = func_2()
for _ in range(t):
    func_4()
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was mostly correct, but it overlooked the potential issue with the modulo operation when handling counterclockwise throws.
- The corrected code ensures that the modulo operation always results in a non-negative value, which is necessary for a 1-indexed circle.

Final: **False** (The original program had a potential issue with the modulo operation, which has been corrected in the reasoning and code above.)
