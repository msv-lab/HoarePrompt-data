To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the loop and understand how it modifies the variables `ans`, `n`, `m`, and `x`.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for _ in range(m):
    r, c = func_1().split()
    r = int(r)
    temp = set()
    for q in ans:
        if c == '0' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q + r) % n)
        if c == '1' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q - r) % n)
    ans = temp
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations**: The loop runs `m` times.
2. **Function `func_1()`**: This function returns a string that is split into `r` and `c`. `r` is converted to an integer.
3. **Set `temp`**: This set is used to store the new values of `ans` for each iteration.
4. **Modulo Operation**: The values in `ans` are modified by adding or subtracting `r` and then taking the result modulo `n`.

### Step-by-Step Execution:
- **Initial `ans`**: The set `ans` starts with a single value `x`.
- **Each Iteration**:
  - `r` and `c` are obtained from `func_1()`.
  - For each value `q` in `ans`:
    - If `c` is '0' or '?', `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.
    - If `c` is '1' or '?', `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.
  - After processing all values in `ans`, `ans` is updated to `temp`.

### Final State:
- After `m` iterations, `ans` will contain all possible values that can be generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` and for each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`.

### Natural Language Description:
- The set `ans` will contain all unique values that can be generated by repeatedly adding or subtracting `r` (for each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`) to the initial value `x` and taking the result modulo `n`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged, and `ans` is a set containing all unique values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` and for each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`.**
