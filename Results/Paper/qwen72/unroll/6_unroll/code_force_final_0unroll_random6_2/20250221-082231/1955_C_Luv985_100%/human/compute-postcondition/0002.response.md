The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4. Since `T` is already guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once without any adjustments.

State: **`T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, and the function should take three parameters: `T`, a list of pairs `(n, k)`, and a list of lists `a`. `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each pair `(n, k)` in the list of pairs represents the number of ships (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and the number of Kraken attacks (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15). Each list in `a` contains `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the durability of the ships. The length of the list `a` should match the number of test cases `T`, and each sublist in `a` should correspond to the `n` in the respective test case. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
