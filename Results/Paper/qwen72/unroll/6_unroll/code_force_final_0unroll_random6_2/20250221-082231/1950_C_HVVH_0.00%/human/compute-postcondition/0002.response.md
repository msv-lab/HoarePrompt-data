The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it will take on values from 0 to `n-1` during the loop's execution.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0**
