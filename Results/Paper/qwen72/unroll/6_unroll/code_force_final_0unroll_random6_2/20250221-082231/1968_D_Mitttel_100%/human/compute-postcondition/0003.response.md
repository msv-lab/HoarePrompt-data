Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of `p`, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**

The code initializes a new list `vis` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The other variables (`a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `mx`, and `cur`) remain unchanged.
