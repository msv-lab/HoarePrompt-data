The only objects in the loop head are the variables `r` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which already ensures that the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `r` will be initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1 and `r` is 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0**
