### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `num`.

2. **Initial Check for All Elements Being Equal:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are already equal by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the next one.
   - If all elements are equal or the array has only one element, it prints `0` because no operation is needed.

3. **Finding the Longest Prefix and Suffix with the Same Element:**
   - The program then creates a copy of the array `onum` and reverses it.
   - It initializes two counters `cn` and `ck` to count the length of the longest prefix and suffix where all elements are the same, respectively.
   - It iterates through the array to count the length of the longest prefix of the same element starting from the beginning.
   - It iterates through the reversed array to count the length of the longest suffix of the same element starting from the end.

4. **Combining Prefix and Suffix:**
   - If the first element of the original array (`symb1`) is the same as the first element of the reversed array (`symb2`), it adds the lengths of the prefix and suffix together.
   - The program then prints the result of `n - max(cn, ck)`, which represents the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Initial Check:**
  - The initial check for all elements being equal is correct. If all elements are the same, the cost is `0` because no operation is needed.
  - If the array has only one element, the cost is also `0` because the array is already uniform.

- **Correctness of Prefix and Suffix Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the length of the longest prefix and suffix where all elements are the same.
  - If the first element of the array is the same as the last element, it combines the lengths of the prefix and suffix to get the maximum possible length of a segment that can be made uniform without additional cost.

- **Correctness of Final Output:**
  - The final output `n - max(cn, ck)` is correct because it represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the entire array uniform.
  - If the first and last elements are the same, the combined length of the prefix and suffix is considered, which ensures the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem by identifying the longest prefix and suffix of the same element and calculating the minimum cost to make the entire array uniform. The logic and implementation are sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
