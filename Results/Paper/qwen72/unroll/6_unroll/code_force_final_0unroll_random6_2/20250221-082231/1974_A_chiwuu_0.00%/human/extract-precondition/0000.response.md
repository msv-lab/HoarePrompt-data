Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters, x and y, where x is the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and y is the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon. Both x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.** 

However, the provided function definition does not include parameters for x and y. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func(x, y):
```

With the precondition:

**x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.**
