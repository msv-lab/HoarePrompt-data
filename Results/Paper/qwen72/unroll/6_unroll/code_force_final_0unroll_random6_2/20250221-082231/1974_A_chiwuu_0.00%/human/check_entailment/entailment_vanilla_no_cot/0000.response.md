Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and then determining if the remaining cells can accommodate the 1x1 icons. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons as `t = b * 2`. This is incorrect because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. The correct calculation should be based on the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons and the total number of cells available per screen.
   - The correct calculation should be `t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15`, which ensures that the number of screens is rounded up correctly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation for Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons as `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. This is correct.
   - However, the program then calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons as `t2 = a - t1` and `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t2 % 15 != 0`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility that the remaining 1x1 icons can fit into the already allocated screens.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where there are no 2x2 icons (`b = 0`) correctly. It should directly calculate the number of screens required for 1x1 icons.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons**:
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. The number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15`.

2. **Calculate the remaining cells on the screens**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells on the screens are `remaining_cells = t * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Calculate the number of screens required for 1x1 icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are enough to fit all 1x1 icons, no additional screens are needed.
   - If the remaining cells are not enough, calculate the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons as `additional_screens = (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15`.

4. **Output the total number of screens**:
   - The total number of screens required is `t + additional_screens`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons
        t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15
        
        # Calculate the remaining cells on the screens
        remaining_cells = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 1x1 icons
        if remaining_cells >= a:
            additional_screens = 0
        else:
            additional_screens = (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15
        
        # Output the total number of screens
        print(t + additional_screens)
```

This corrected program should handle all test cases correctly.
