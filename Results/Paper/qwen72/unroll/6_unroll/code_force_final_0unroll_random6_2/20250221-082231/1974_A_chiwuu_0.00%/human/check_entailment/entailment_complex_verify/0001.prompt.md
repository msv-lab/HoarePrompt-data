You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, x and y, where x is the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and y is the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon. Both x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.

    #State: The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and the loop prints the value of `t` for each iteration based on the input values `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads `n` pairs of integers `(a, b)` from the user, where `a` represents the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `b` represents the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. For each pair, it calculates and prints the minimum number of 15 × 15 grid cells required to display all the icons, considering the different sizes of the icons. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows x 3 columns).
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2` because each 2x2 icon requires 2 rows (since 2x2 icons can be placed in a 2x2 block, and each screen has 5 rows, so 2 rows per 2x2 icon).
   - The program then checks if `t` is divisible by 5. If it is, `t` is set to `t // 5`. If not, `t` is set to `t // 5 + 1`. This ensures that the number of screens is rounded up to the nearest whole number.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons on the screens already allocated: `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - It then checks if the remaining space on these screens is enough to place all 1x1 icons (`a`). If it is, the number of screens remains `t`.

4. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining space is not enough for all 1x1 icons, the program calculates the additional number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The variable `t2` is set to `a - t1`, which represents the number of 1x1 icons that cannot fit in the already allocated screens.
   - The program then checks if `t2` is divisible by 15. If it is, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15`. If not, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1` to account for the additional screen needed.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of 2x2 Icon Placement**:
  - The calculation `t = b * 2` and the subsequent rounding up to the nearest whole number of screens is correct. Each 2x2 icon requires 2 rows, and since each screen has 5 rows, the number of screens required is `ceil(b * 2 / 5)`.
  - The program correctly calculates this as `t = t // 5 + 1` if `t % 5 != 0`.

- **Correctness of 1x1 Icon Placement**:
  - The program correctly calculates the remaining space on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
  - If the remaining space is enough for all 1x1 icons, the number of screens remains `t`.
  - If not, the program correctly calculates the additional number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons: `t2 = a - t1` and `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t2 % 15 != 0`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
