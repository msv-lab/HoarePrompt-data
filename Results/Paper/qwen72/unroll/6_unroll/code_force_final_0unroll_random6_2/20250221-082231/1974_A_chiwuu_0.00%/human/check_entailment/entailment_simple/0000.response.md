### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2` to determine the total number of 2x2 icons.
   - The number of screens required for 2x2 icons is then calculated by dividing `t` by 5 (since each screen can hold 5 rows) and adding 1 if there is a remainder. This is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells**:
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` to determine the total number of cells available after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` (the remaining cells) is greater than or equal to `a` (the number of 1x1 icons), then no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons, and `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, then the remaining 1x1 icons need to be placed on additional screens. The number of additional screens required is calculated by `t2 = a - t1` and then dividing `t2` by 15 (the number of cells per screen) and adding 1 if there is a remainder.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Screens for 2x2 Icons**: The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correct. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. Therefore, the number of screens required for `b` 2x2 icons is `b * 2 // 5 + (b * 2 % 5 > 0)`.
- **Remaining Cells**: The logic for calculating the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons is correct. The total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons is `b * 4`, and the total number of cells available on `t` screens is `t * 15`.
- **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons**: The logic for calculating the additional screens required for 1x1 icons is also correct. If the remaining cells are not enough to place all 1x1 icons, the function correctly calculates the additional screens needed.

### Potential Issues:

- **Variable Naming**: The variable names `t`, `t1`, and `t2` are not very descriptive, which can make the code harder to understand. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `a` or `b` is 0.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons based on the given problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
