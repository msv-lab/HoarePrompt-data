It seems there was a mistake in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the correct function definition should be:

```python
def distribute_coins(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, test_cases is a list of tuples, each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) and a list of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
