### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function summaries to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

1. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `m`.
   - It then calculates the bet amounts `c` for each outcome as \( c_i = \frac{m}{k_i} \).
   - It finds the highest common factor (HCF) of the bet amounts using the function `func_1`.
   - It normalizes the bet amounts by dividing each by the HCF.
   - It checks if the sum of the normalized bet amounts is strictly less than \( \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} \).
   - If the condition is met, it prints the normalized bet amounts; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

2. **Function `func_1` Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list.
   - It does not modify the `numbers` list or any other external variables.

3. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same and the sum of `c` is equal to \( \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} \).

4. **Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: All multipliers \( k_i \) are the same.**
     - For example, consider the input:
       ```
       1
       3
       5 5 5
       ```
     - The program calculates \( m = 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125 \).
     - The list `c` will be \([25, 25, 25]\).
     - The HCF of `c` is 25.
     - The sum of `c` is \( 25 + 25 + 25 = 75 \).
     - The condition \( \text{sum}(c) < \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} \) becomes \( 75 < \frac{125}{25} \), which simplifies to \( 75 < 5 \). This is false, so the program outputs \(-1\), which is correct.

   - **Case 2: Multipliers \( k_i \) are different.**
     - For example, consider the input:
       ```
       1
       3
       3 2 7
       ```
     - The program calculates \( m = 3 \times 2 \times 7 = 42 \).
     - The list `c` will be \([14, 21, 6]\).
     - The HCF of `c` is 1.
     - The sum of `c` is \( 14 + 21 + 6 = 41 \).
     - The condition \( \text{sum}(c) < \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} \) becomes \( 41 < 42 \), which is true, so the program outputs the normalized bet amounts \([14, 21, 6]\), which is correct.

   - **Case 3: Edge cases and constraints.**
     - The program handles the constraints \( 1 \le t \le 10^4 \) and \( 1 \le n \le 50 \) correctly.
     - The program ensures that the bet amounts \( x_i \) are within the range \( 1 \le x_i \le 10^9 \).

5. **Correctness of the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment is incorrect in its claim that the program does not handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same correctly.
   - The program correctly outputs \(-1\) when the sum of the normalized bet amounts is not strictly less than \( \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} \).

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct in handling all the given cases and constraints. It correctly outputs \(-1\) when no valid distribution of coins is possible and outputs valid bet amounts when a solution exists.

Final: **True**
