Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. According to the problem description, if all \( k_i \) are the same, it should output \(-1\) because it is impossible to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
5 5 5
```
The program will calculate \( m \) as \( 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125 \). The list \( c \) will be \([25, 25, 25]\). The HCF (highest common factor) of \( c \) will be 25. The sum of \( c \) will be \( 25 + 25 + 25 = 75 \), which is not greater than \( 125 / 25 = 5 \). Therefore, the program will output \(-1\), which is correct.

However, the program does not correctly handle the case where all \( k_i \) are the same and the sum of \( c \) is equal to \( m / \text{hcf} \). For example:
```
1
2
3 3
```
The program will calculate \( m \) as \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \). The list \( c \) will be \([3, 3]\). The HCF of \( c \) will be 3. The sum of \( c \) will be \( 3 + 3 = 6 \), which is equal to \( 9 / 3 = 3 \). The program will output \(-1\), which is incorrect because the sum of \( c \) should be strictly less than \( 9 / 3 = 3 \), and it is not.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is therefore incorrect.
