To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `numbers`.

1. **`num`**: This variable is not explicitly initialized before the loop, but it will take the value of each element in `numbers[1:]` during the loop iterations.
2. **`numbers`**: The loop will iterate over `numbers[1:]`, which means it will start from the second element of the list `numbers`. For the loop to execute, `numbers` must have at least two elements.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) and a list of integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 <= k_i <= 20). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `hcf` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `numbers`.

We need to ensure that `numbers` has at least two elements for the loop to execute. The state of `hcf` and the other variables (`t` and `test_cases`) are not relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) and a list of integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 <= k_i <= 20). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `hcf` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `numbers`, `numbers` must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `numbers`**.
