Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the final score of the game if both players play optimally. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - The program iterates through the range from 0 to `n-1` to determine the MEX of the array `c` that Alice and Bob are constructing.
   - It checks if the current integer `i` is not in the `Counter` dictionary `mpp`. If `i` is not in `mpp`, it means `i` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `arr`, and thus it is the MEX. The program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `i` is in `mpp` and its count is 1, it checks if `first` is `True`. If `first` is `True`, it means Bob will pick the last occurrence of `i`, and Alice will not be able to add it to `c`. Therefore, `i` is the MEX, and the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `i` is in `mpp` and its count is 1, and `first` is `False`, it means Alice will pick the last occurrence of `i` on her first chance. The program sets `first` to `True`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the MEX for each test case.

This logic ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally, with Alice trying to maximize the MEX and Bob trying to minimize it. The program correctly identifies the MEX based on the optimal play strategy for both players.
