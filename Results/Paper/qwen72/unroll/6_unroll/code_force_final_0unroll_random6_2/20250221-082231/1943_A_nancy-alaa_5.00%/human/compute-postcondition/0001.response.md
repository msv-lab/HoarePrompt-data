Output State: **The loop will print the first integer `i` that is either not present in the list `arr` or is present exactly once after the first occurrence of a number that appears exactly once. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will remain unchanged, but the internal state of the loop, including the `mpp` dictionary and the `first` flag, will be reset for each iteration of the outer loop.**
