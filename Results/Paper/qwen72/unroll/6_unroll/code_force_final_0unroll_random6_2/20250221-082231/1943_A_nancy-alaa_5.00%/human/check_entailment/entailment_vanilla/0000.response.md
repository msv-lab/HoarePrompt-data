Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a` of size `n`. Alice appends the element she picks to a new array `c`, while Bob just removes the element he picks. The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been removed from `a`, assuming both players play optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should always pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` and that appears more than once in `a`. This ensures that Bob cannot immediately pick the same element to prevent Alice from adding it to `c`.
   - **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should pick the smallest element that appears only once in `a` to prevent Alice from adding it to `c`.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `first` to `False`.
   - It iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If `i` is not in the keys of the `Counter` (i.e., `i` does not appear in `arr`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is correct because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array.
     - If `i` appears exactly once in `arr` and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is because if `first` is `True`, it means Alice has already picked an element that appears only once, and Bob can now pick the next smallest element that appears only once to minimize the MEX.
     - If `i` appears exactly once in `arr` and `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True`. This indicates that Alice has picked the first element that appears only once.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in `arr` appear more than once, the program will correctly print the smallest `i` that is not in `arr`.
   - If all elements in `arr` appear exactly once, the program will correctly print the smallest `i` that is not in `arr` or the smallest `i` that appears exactly once after Alice's first turn.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players.
   - It handles all edge cases and produces the correct MEX for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
