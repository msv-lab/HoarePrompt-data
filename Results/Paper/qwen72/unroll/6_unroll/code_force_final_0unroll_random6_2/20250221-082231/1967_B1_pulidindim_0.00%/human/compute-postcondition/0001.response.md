To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(t):`. The only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- The function `func` is expected to take two positive integers `n` and `m` as inputs, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
- The function should handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` now being an input integer.
- The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^6.

For the loop to execute:
- `t` must be greater than 0, because if `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.
- `i` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting index for the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
