You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two positive integers `n` and `m` as inputs, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function should handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: The function `func` has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, the final value of `ans` is printed as an integer. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` retain their initial values, and the loop counter `i` has completed all iterations from 0 to `t-1`. The variable `count` for each test case ends with a value that is either `m + 1` or the value where `g < count - 1` condition breaks the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), it implies that \(a + b\) must be divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be simplified to \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - Rearranging, we get \(a + b = b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \cdot k\), which implies \(a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program initializes the number of test cases \(t\) and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to \(n\).
   - It then enters a loop where it increments `count` from 2 to \(m\).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - It calculates `g` as \(n / \text{count}\).
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, it breaks out of the loop.
   - It updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` and then adds \(\text{g} / \text{count} + 1\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the integer value of `ans`.

4. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The variable `g` is calculated as \(n / \text{count}\), which does not seem to be related to the problem's requirements.
   - The update to `ans` using \(\text{g} / \text{count} + 1\) does not align with the problem's logic.
   - The program does not use the \(\gcd\) function, which is essential for solving the problem.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Alternatively, a more efficient approach would involve precomputing the number of valid pairs for each \(b\) and using that to quickly answer each test case.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It lacks the necessary steps to compute the \(\gcd\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
