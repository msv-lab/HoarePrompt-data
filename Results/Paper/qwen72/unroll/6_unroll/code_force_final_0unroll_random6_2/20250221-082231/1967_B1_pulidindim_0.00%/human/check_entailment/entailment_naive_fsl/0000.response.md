Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) for the given conditions. One issue is in the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs. Specifically, the line `ans += g / count + 1` does not correctly account for the integer division and the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. 

For example, consider the input `n = 3` and `m = 5`. The correct output should be `4` (valid pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1)). However, the program outputs `5`, which is incorrect. This indicates that the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.
