### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Loop for Test Cases:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization of `count` and `ans`:**
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
   - The variable `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
   - The adjusted `g` is then divided by `count` and incremented by 1, and the result is added to `ans`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the integer value of `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Initial Setup:**
  - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.

- **Correctness of the Main Logic:**
  - The main logic of the function is intended to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
  - However, the logic inside the loop is not correctly implementing the required condition. Specifically, the calculation of `g` and the adjustment of `g` do not align with the problem statement.

- **Mathematical Condition:**
  - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` means that `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.
  - The current implementation does not check this condition. Instead, it performs a series of arithmetic operations that do not directly relate to the problem's requirements.

- **Example Test Cases:**
  - For the test case `n = 10, m = 8`, the correct pairs are:
    - (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2).
  - The function should count these pairs, but the current logic does not correctly do so.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
