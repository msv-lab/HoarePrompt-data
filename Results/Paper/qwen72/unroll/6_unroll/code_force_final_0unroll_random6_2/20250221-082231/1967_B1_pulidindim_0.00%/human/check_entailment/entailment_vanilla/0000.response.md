### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), it implies that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which can be rewritten as \(a = (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1) \cdot b\).
   - This means \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to \(n\).
   - It then iterates over `count` from 2 to \(m\):
     - For each `count`, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
     - It calculates `g` as \(n / \text{count}\).
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, it breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` and adds \(\lfloor g / \text{count} \rfloor + 1\) to `ans`.
     - It increments `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the integer value of `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic of calculating `g` and updating `ans` is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
   - The program seems to be counting pairs in a way that does not match the given conditions, leading to incorrect results.

### Example Verification:
- For the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the correct pairs are:
  - (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)
  - The program should output 14, but the logic in the program does not ensure this.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for counting valid pairs is flawed and does not match the required conditions.

**Correctness: False**
