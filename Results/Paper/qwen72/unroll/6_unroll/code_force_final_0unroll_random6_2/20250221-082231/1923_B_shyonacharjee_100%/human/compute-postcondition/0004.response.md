Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` and processes `t` test cases. Each test case consists of four inputs: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. It determines whether a player can survive an attack from `n` monsters, where each monster has a position `x_i` and health `a_i`. The player can survive if the total number of bullets needed to defeat all monsters (sum of their health) does not exceed the maximum number of bullets the player can shoot, which is `k` times the distance of the farthest monster. The function prints 'YES' if the player can survive and 'NO' otherwise for each test case. The function does not return any value. **
