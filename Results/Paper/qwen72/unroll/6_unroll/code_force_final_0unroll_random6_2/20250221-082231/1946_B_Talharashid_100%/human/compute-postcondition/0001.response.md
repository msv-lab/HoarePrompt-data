Output State: **The variable `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` has been printed, where `maxi` is the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of `l` that does not contain any negative number that would reset the sum to zero. The variables `n`, `k`, and `l` are reset for each iteration, and `a` remains unchanged.**
