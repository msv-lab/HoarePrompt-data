It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. The function described in the problem is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`, but the function definition you provided is `def func():`. I will correct this and provide the precondition based on the problem description.

Problem description: Write a function to generate files for HTML files in a specified range of folder names. The function should:
- Get the current directory and list all subfolders.
- Check if the folder name is a digit and falls within the specified range.
- For each folder that meets the criteria, list all `.html` files.
- For each `.html` file, create two new files: one with `-ac.py` and the other with `-wa.py` appended to the base name of the HTML file.
- Print the number of HTML files in each qualifying folder and the names of the generated files.

Function definition:
```python
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that 0 <= start <= end.**
