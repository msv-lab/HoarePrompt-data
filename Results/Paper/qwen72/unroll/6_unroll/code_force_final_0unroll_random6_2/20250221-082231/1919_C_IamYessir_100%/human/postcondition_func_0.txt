The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then distributes these integers between two lists, `a` and `b`, based on certain conditions. After processing, it calculates the total number of increasing pairs in both lists and prints this count. The function does not return any value.
