Reasoning:  
The provided function `func` aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty by splitting an array into two subsequences and calculating the penalty based on the number of increasing pairs in each subsequence. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation that make the function incorrect:

1. **Function Definition**: The function should be defined as `def min_penalty(a, n):` to match the problem description, but it is defined as `def func():`. This is a minor issue that can be easily fixed but affects the function's signature.

2. **Subsequence Splitting Logic**: The logic for splitting the array into two subsequences `a` and `b` is flawed. The conditions used to decide which subsequence to append the current element to are not optimal and do not guarantee the minimum possible penalty. Specifically, the conditions:
   - `if x > y:`
   - `if x == y:`
   - `if x < y:`
   are not sufficient to ensure that the subsequences are split in a way that minimizes the penalty.

3. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty is calculated by counting the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences `a` and `b`. This part of the code is correct in terms of how it calculates the penalty, but the subsequences `a` and `b` are not being split optimally.

4. **Optimal Solution**: The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to ensure that no increasing pairs are formed in either subsequence. This can be achieved by splitting the array such that all elements in one subsequence are less than or equal to all elements in the other subsequence. If this is not possible, the penalty can be minimized by ensuring that the number of increasing pairs is as small as possible.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
