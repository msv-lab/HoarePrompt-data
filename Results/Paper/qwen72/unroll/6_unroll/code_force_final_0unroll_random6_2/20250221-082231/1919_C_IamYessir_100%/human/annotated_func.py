#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_penalty(a, n):` where `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= len(a), and `n` is the length of the list `a` and is a positive integer.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a, b = [], []
        
        cp = 0
        
        for i in range(0, n):
            if len(a) == 0:
                x = float('inf')
            else:
                x = a[-1]
            if len(b) == 0:

                    b.append(lit[i])

            elif x < y:

    #State: The loop iterates over multiple test cases, each time reading a new integer `n` and a list `lit` of `n` integers. For each test case, the loop processes the list `lit` and distributes the elements between two lists `a` and `b` based on the conditions provided. After processing, it calculates the number of increasing pairs in both `a` and `b` and prints this count. The variables `a`, `b`, and `s` are reset for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then distributes these integers between two lists, `a` and `b`, based on certain conditions. After processing, it calculates the total number of increasing pairs in both lists and prints this count. The function does not return any value.
