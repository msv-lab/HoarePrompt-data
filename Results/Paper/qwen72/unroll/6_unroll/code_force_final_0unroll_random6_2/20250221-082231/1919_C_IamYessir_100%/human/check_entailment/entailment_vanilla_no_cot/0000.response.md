Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for splitting the array into subsequences `a` and `b` is flawed and does not ensure that the penalty is minimized. The conditions used to decide whether to append an element to `a` or `b` are not optimal and can lead to suboptimal splits, resulting in a higher penalty than necessary.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to understand that the goal is to minimize the number of increasing pairs in the subsequences. The optimal strategy is to place all elements in one subsequence, as this will always result in a penalty of 0, since a single subsequence cannot have any increasing pairs if it is sorted in non-increasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Since the optimal strategy is to place all elements in one subsequence,
        # the minimum possible penalty is always 0.
        print(0)
```

This program will always output 0, which is the correct minimum possible penalty for any input array, as explained in the problem statement.
