### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Output Conditions**:
   - If `k == n`, the function prints an array of `n` ones. This is correct because an array of `n` ones will have all `n` cyclic shifts sorted.
   - If `k == 1`, the function prints the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. This is correct because the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function prints `-1`. This is incorrect because there are other possible arrays that can satisfy the condition of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The function does not handle the general case where `1 < k < n`. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the function will print `-1`, but a valid array could be `[1, 1, 2, 2]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 1, 2, 2]` and `[2, 2, 1, 1]`.

### Conclusion:
The function is incorrect because it does not handle the general case where `1 < k < n`. It only handles the edge cases where `k == n` or `k == 1`, and for all other cases, it incorrectly outputs `-1`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
