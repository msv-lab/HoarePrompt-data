You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, n and k, where n is the length of the array and k is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required. Both n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function should handle up to 10^3 test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        
        print(*res)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read a pair of integers `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` equals `n`, it will print an array of `n` ones. If `k` equals 1, it will print the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, it will print `-1`. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` will be unchanged, but the output will be the result of the print statements for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the length of an array and `k` is a parameter. If `k` equals `n`, it prints an array of `n` ones. If `k` equals 1, it prints the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the output will be the printed results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array \( a \) of length \( n \) such that exactly \( k \) of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - The array \( a \) should satisfy \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \) for each \( 1 \leq i \leq n \).

2. **Special Cases:**
   - **Case 1: \( k = n \)**
     - If \( k = n \), all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. This is only possible if the array is constant (i.e., all elements are the same).
     - Therefore, the array \( [1, 1, \ldots, 1] \) (with \( n \) elements) is a valid solution.
   - **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**
     - If \( k = 1 \), exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. This can be achieved by creating an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order, except for one element that is much larger than the others.
     - For example, the array \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n-1, n] \) will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself.
   - **Case 3: \( 1 < k < n \)**
     - If \( 1 < k < n \), it is not possible to construct an array that has exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. This is because if an array has more than one sorted cyclic shift, it implies that the array must have a repeating pattern or be constant, which would result in either all shifts being sorted or none being sorted.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program handles the special cases correctly:
     - For \( k = n \), it constructs an array with all elements equal to 1.
     - For \( k = 1 \), it constructs an array with elements in the range \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - For any other \( k \), it outputs \(-1\).

4. **Verification:**
   - **Case \( k = n \):**
     - The array \( [1, 1, \ldots, 1] \) is indeed sorted in all cyclic shifts.
   - **Case \( k = 1 \):**
     - The array \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) is sorted only in its original form.
   - **Case \( 1 < k < n \):**
     - The program correctly outputs \(-1\) because no such array exists.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
