Reasoning:

1. **Case when `k == n`:**  
   - The program outputs an array of `n` ones.  
   - This is correct because an array of `n` ones will have all `n` cyclic shifts sorted, as each shift will still be an array of `n` ones.  
   - Example: For `n = 4` and `k = 4`, the output `[1, 1, 1, 1]` is correct because all cyclic shifts of `[1, 1, 1, 1]` are sorted.

2. **Case when `k == 1`:**  
   - The program outputs the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.  
   - This is correct because an array with distinct elements in increasing order will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the original array itself.  
   - Example: For `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the output `[0, 1, 2]` is correct because only the original array `[0, 1, 2]` is sorted, and the other cyclic shifts `[1, 2, 0]` and `[2, 0, 1]` are not sorted.

3. **Case when `k != n` and `k != 1`:**  
   - The program outputs `-1`.  
   - This is correct because for any other value of `k`, it is impossible to construct an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.  
   - Example: For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the output `-1` is correct because there is no array of length 3 that has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts.

The program handles all the specified cases correctly and produces the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
