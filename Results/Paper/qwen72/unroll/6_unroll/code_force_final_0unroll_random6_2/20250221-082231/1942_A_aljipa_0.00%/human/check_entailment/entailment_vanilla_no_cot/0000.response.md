Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Case for \( k = n \)**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( k = n \) by outputting an array of all 1s. This is correct because an array of all 1s will have all cyclic shifts sorted.

2. **Case for \( k = 1 \)**:
   - The program outputs the range from 0 to \( n-1 \) (i.e., `range(n)`). This is incorrect because the elements of the array should be between 1 and \( 10^9 \), and the range function generates values starting from 0. Additionally, the array generated by `range(n)` is not guaranteed to have exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

3. **Case for \( k \neq 1 \) and \( k \neq n \)**:
   - The program outputs `-1` for all other cases. This is incorrect because there are valid arrays for some other values of \( k \) and \( n \).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to handle the following cases:

1. **If \( k = n \)**:
   - Output an array of all 1s, as this will have all cyclic shifts sorted.

2. **If \( k = 1 \)**:
   - Output an array where the first element is the largest and the rest are in increasing order. For example, for \( n = 3 \), you can output `[3, 1, 2]`.

3. **If \( k \neq 1 \) and \( k \neq n \)**:
   - You need to construct an array that has exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. One way to do this is to create an array where the first \( k \) elements are in increasing order and the remaining elements are all the same and greater than the last element of the first \( k \) elements. For example, for \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 3 \), you can output `[1, 2, 3, 1000000000, 1000000000]`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == n:
            res = [1] * n
        elif k == 1:
            res = [10**9] + list(range(1, n))
        elif k > 1 and k < n:
            res = list(range(1, k + 1)) + [10**9] * (n - k)
        else:
            res = [-1]
        print(*res)

func()
```

This program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.
