Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read a pair of integers `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` equals `n`, it will print an array of `n` ones. If `k` equals 1, it will print the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, it will print `-1`. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` will be unchanged, but the output will be the result of the print statements for each test case.**
