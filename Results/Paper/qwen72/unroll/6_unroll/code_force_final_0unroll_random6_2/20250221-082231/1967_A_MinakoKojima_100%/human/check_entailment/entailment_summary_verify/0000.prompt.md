You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    ans_list = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        ans = a[0]
        res = n - 1
        for i in range(n - 1):
            dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
            if dif == 0:
                res -= 1
            if dif != 0:
                if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                    ans += dif
                    k -= dif * (i + 1)
                    res -= 1
                else:
                    ans += k // (i + 1)
                    if i != 0:
                        res += k % (i + 1)
                    k = 0
                    break
                if k == 0:
                    break
        if k != 0:
            ans += k // n
            res += k % n
        ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
        ans += res
        ans_list.append(ans)
    for a in ans_list:
        print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards (`n`), the number of coins available for buying new cards (`k`), and a list of integers (`a`) representing the initial number of cards of each type. For each test case, it calculates the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by spending the available coins and prints the result for each test case. The final state of the program is that `ans_list` contains the results for all test cases, and the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are no longer meaningful outside the context of the loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle the case where the number of coins \( k \) is sufficient to make all card counts equal, but the remaining coins are not enough to form additional complete permutations of \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 5
1 2 3
```

The initial counts of cards are:
- 1 card with the number 1
- 2 cards with the number 2
- 3 cards with the number 3

The program will try to make the counts of all cards equal by using the coins. The minimum count is 1, and the maximum count is 3. To make all counts equal to 3, the program will need:
- 2 coins to buy 2 more cards of type 1
- 1 coin to buy 1 more card of type 2

After using 3 coins, the counts will be:
- 3 cards with the number 1
- 3 cards with the number 2
- 3 cards with the number 3

The program will then have 2 coins left. It will try to use these remaining coins to increase the score, but it will not correctly handle the remaining coins to form additional complete permutations. The program will add 2 to the score, but it should actually form one more complete permutation, resulting in a score of 4.

The correct output for this case should be:
```
4
```

However, the program will output:
```
5
```

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the remaining coins to form additional complete permutations, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
