Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `ans_list` will contain the results of the computations for each test case, and the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` will no longer be in their initial states but will have been updated or redefined within the loop. The final state of `ans_list` will be a list of integers, each representing the final answer for the corresponding test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` will have no meaningful values outside the context of the loop, as they are redefined for each test case.**
