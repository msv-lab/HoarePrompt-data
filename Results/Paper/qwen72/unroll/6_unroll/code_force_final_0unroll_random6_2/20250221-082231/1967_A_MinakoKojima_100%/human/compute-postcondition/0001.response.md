The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set to 0 at the start of the loop. The other variables and lists mentioned in the state before the loop (t, n, k, a, ans_list) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted directly for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
