### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (1, 2, or 3).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(extroverts, universals)`**:
     - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, it checks if the remainder of `extroverts % 3` plus `universals` is at least 3. If not, it returns `None` because it's impossible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts.
     - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3, which ensures that all extroverts and universals are accommodated in the minimum number of tents.

   - **`func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`**:
     - This function calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals as required, so `func_2` returns -1.
     - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (each of whom needs a separate tent) to the result of `func_1` and returns the total number of tents.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert requires a separate tent, so the number of introverts directly adds to the total number of tents.
   - **Extroverts and Universals:** The function `func_1` ensures that the extroverts are accommodated in tents with exactly two others, and any remaining universals are used to fill the tents. If it's impossible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts, `func_1` returns `None`, and `func_2` correctly returns -1.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - If there are no participants (`a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`), the function correctly returns 0.
     - If there are only introverts (`a > 0, b = 0, c = 0`), the function correctly returns the number of introverts.
     - If there are only extroverts and universals (`a = 0, b > 0, c > 0`), the function correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed.
     - If there are only extroverts and not enough universals to form a tent with the remaining extroverts, the function correctly returns -1.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly handle all the cases described in the problem and produce the expected output for each test case.

### Correctness: **True**
