### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the logic of the program, specifically in the `func_1` function. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements:**
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (1, 2, or 3).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - The condition `if extroverts % 3 != 0:` checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3.
   - The condition `if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:` checks if the sum of the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 and the number of universals is less than 3. If this condition is true, the function returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals.

3. **Flaw in `func_1`:**
   - The condition `if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:` is not sufficient to ensure that each extrovert can be placed in a tent with exactly two others.
   - For example, consider the input `1 1 1`:
     - `extroverts = 1` and `universals = 1`.
     - `extroverts % 3 = 1`.
     - `extroverts % 3 + universals = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is less than 3.
     - According to the function, this should return `None`, but it does not. Instead, it returns `1` because `ceil((1 + 1) / 3) = 1`.

4. **Correct Logic:**
   - To correctly handle the extroverts, we need to ensure that the number of universals is sufficient to fill the remaining spots in the tents for the extroverts.
   - Specifically, if `extroverts % 3 != 0`, we need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. The number of remaining spots is `3 - (extroverts % 3)`, and we need at least this many universals to fill the spots.

5. **Example Revisited:**
   - For the input `1 1 1`:
     - `extroverts = 1` and `universals = 1`.
     - `extroverts % 3 = 1`.
     - We need `3 - 1 = 2` universals to fill the remaining spots in the tent for the extrovert.
     - Since we only have 1 universal, it is impossible to accommodate the extrovert, and the correct output should be `-1`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program fails to handle the case where there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots for extroverts.
   - The program does not correctly account for the requirement that each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
