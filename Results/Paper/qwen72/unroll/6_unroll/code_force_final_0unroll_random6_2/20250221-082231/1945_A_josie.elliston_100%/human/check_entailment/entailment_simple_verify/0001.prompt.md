You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert needs a separate tent.
   - **Extroverts:** Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (1, 2, or 3).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**
   - This function calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate extroverts and universals.
   - **Case 1:** If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it means there are some extroverts that cannot form a complete tent of 3 people. In this case, we need to check if the remaining extroverts plus the universals can form a complete tent.
     - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts, so we return `None` (indicating it's impossible).
   - **Case 2:** If `extroverts % 3 == 0`, we can form complete tents with all extroverts, and any remaining universals can be accommodated in the remaining tents.
   - The function returns the ceiling of the total number of people divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed by combining the results from `func_1` and the number of introverts.
   - **Step 1:** Call `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
   - **Step 2:** If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so we return `-1`.
   - **Step 3:** If `func_1` returns a valid number, add the number of introverts to this value to get the total number of tents needed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** If `a = 0` and `b = 0`, the number of tents needed is simply the number of universals divided by 3.
   - **Case 2:** If `a > 0` and `b > 0`, we need to ensure that the remaining universals can form complete tents with the extroverts.
   - **Case 3:** If `a = 0` and `b > 0`, we need to ensure that the universals can form complete tents with the extroverts.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:** `1 2 3`
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 2 extroverts need 1 tent, and 1 universal can join to form a complete tent.
     - Universals: 2 universals can form 1 tent.
     - Total: 1 (introvert) + 1 (extroverts + universal) + 1 (universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Example 2:** `1 4 1`
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 2 tents, but there is only 1 universal left, which is not enough to form a complete tent.
     - Total: -1 (impossible).
   - **Example 3:** `1 4 2`
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 2 tents, and 2 universals can join to form complete tents.
     - Total: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts + universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Example 4:** `1 1 1`
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 1 extrovert needs 1 tent, but there is only 1 universal left, which is not enough to form a complete tent.
     - Total: -1 (impossible).
   - **Example 5:** `1 3 2`
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 3 extroverts need 1 tent, and 2 universals can form 1 tent.
     - Total: 1 (introvert) + 1 (extroverts) + 1 (universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Example 6:** `19 7 18`
     - Introverts: 19 tents.
     - Extroverts: 7 extroverts need 3 tents (2 extroverts + 1 universal in each tent).
     - Universals: 18 - 3 = 15 universals can form 5 tents.
     - Total: 19 (introverts) + 3 (extroverts + universals) + 5 (universals) = 27 tents.
   - **Example 7:** `0 0 0`
     - No participants, so 0 tents.
   - **Example 8:** `7 0 0`
     - Introverts: 7 tents.
     - Total: 7 tents.
   - **Example 9:** `0 24 0`
     - Extroverts: 24 extroverts need 8 tents.
     - Total: 8 tents.
   - **Example 10:** `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
     - Introverts: 1000000000 tents.
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 extroverts need 333333334 tents (1000000000 / 3 = 333333333.33, ceiling is 333333334).
     - Universals: 1000000000 - 333333334 = 666666666 universals can form 222222222 tents.
     - Total: 1000000000 (introverts) + 333333334 (extroverts + universals) + 222222222 (universals) = 1666666667 tents.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the edge cases and the problem requirements. It ensures that introverts are given separate tents, extroverts are given complete tents, and universals are used to fill the remaining spots in the tents.

### Correctness:
