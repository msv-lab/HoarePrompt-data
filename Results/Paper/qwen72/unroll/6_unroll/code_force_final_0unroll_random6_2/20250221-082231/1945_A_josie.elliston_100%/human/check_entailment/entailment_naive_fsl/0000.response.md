Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly account for the requirement that each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1 1 1
```
Expected Output:
```
-1
```
Actual Output:
```
1
```

In this case, there is 1 introvert, 1 extrovert, and 1 universal. The introvert must be in a tent alone, which means we need 1 tent for the introvert. The extrovert, however, cannot be accommodated because they need to be in a tent with exactly two other people, but only one universal is available. Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. However, the program incorrectly returns `1`.

This failure is due to the logic in `func_1` not properly checking if the remaining universals can fill the required spots for extroverts. Specifically, the condition `if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:` is not sufficient to ensure that each extrovert can be placed in a tent with exactly two others.
