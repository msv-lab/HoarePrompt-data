You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of length `n` with elements 0 or 1, representing a ribbon with cells that are either free or contain a chip. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` will be 0, and the variables `n`, `a`, and `res` will hold the values from the last test case processed, but these values will not be used further.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the ribbon.

2. **Trimming the Ribbon**:
   - The program trims the ribbon by removing leading and trailing zeros. This is done using two `while` loops:
     - The first loop removes leading zeros (`while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`).
     - The second loop removes trailing zeros (`while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`).
   - This step is crucial because it focuses on the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips, ignoring the free cells at the beginning and end.

3. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - After trimming, the program counts the number of free cells (`0`s) within the segment that contains all the chips.
   - The variable `res` is incremented for each free cell found in the trimmed ribbon.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result `res` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Correctness**:
  - The algorithm correctly identifies the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips by trimming leading and trailing zeros.
  - The number of free cells within this segment is indeed the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. This is because each free cell within the segment represents a potential move of a chip to the left to form a contiguous block.
  - The program handles all edge cases, such as when there are no free cells between the chips or when the chips are already in a single block.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the ribbon is already a single block of chips (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1`), the program correctly outputs `0`.
  - If there are no free cells to the left of any chip, the program correctly trims the ribbon and counts the free cells within the segment.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
