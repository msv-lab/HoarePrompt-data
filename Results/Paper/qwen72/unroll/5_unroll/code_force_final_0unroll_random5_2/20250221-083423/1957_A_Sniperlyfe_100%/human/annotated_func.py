#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100, and each integer a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `freq` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `arr`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in `arr`. The list `arr` remains unchanged.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3. Each value in `freq` represents the frequency of an integer in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each integer in `arr` by 3. The list `arr` remains unchanged.
