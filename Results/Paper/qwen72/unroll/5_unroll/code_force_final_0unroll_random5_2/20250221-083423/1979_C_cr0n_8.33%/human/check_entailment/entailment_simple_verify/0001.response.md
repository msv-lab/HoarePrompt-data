### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - This product is used to determine the bets for each outcome. Specifically, the bet for the i-th outcome is calculated as `prod // vals[i]`.

3. **Denominator Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the bets `sum(vprod)`.
   - It then subtracts this sum from the product `prod` to get the denominator `den`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and returns, indicating that no valid distribution of coins is possible.

4. **Output**:
   - If `den` is greater than 0, the program prints the bets `vprod` for each outcome.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The key idea is to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
  - By setting the bet for the i-th outcome as `prod // vals[i]`, the program ensures that the total bet is `sum(vprod)`.
  - The condition `den > 0` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than `prod`, which is the sum of the potential winnings for each outcome.

- **Mathematical Validity**:
  - The product `prod` of all multipliers is a common multiple of all `k_i`.
  - The bet for the i-th outcome `vprod[i]` is `prod // k_i`, which ensures that the total bet is `sum(vprod)`.
  - The denominator `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`. If `den > 0`, it means that the total bet is strictly less than `prod`, and thus the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If all multipliers are the same, the sum of the bets `sum(vprod)` will be `prod // k * n`, where `k` is the common multiplier and `n` is the number of outcomes.
  - If `k * n >= prod`, then `den` will be less than or equal to 0, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.

- **Output Constraints**:
  - The bets `vprod` are calculated as `prod // k_i`, which ensures that each bet is an integer and within the range `1 <= x_i <= 10^9`.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call**:
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
  - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \le n \le 50\).
  - `k` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(k_i\) satisfies \(2 \le k_i \le 20\).

- **State After Reading Inputs in `func_1`**:
  - `N` is an input integer.
  - `vals` is a list of integers read from the input.
  - `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`.

- **State After Calculating Bets**:
  - `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `prod // vals[i]`.
  - `den` is the result of `prod - sum(vprod)`.

- **State After Denominator Check**:
  - If `den <= 0`, the program prints `-1` and returns, correctly indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
  - If `den > 0`, the program prints the bets `vprod`.

### Final Evaluation:

The program's logic and implementation are correct. It correctly handles the input, calculates the bets, and ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The edge cases are also handled appropriately, and the output constraints are satisfied.

Final: **True**
