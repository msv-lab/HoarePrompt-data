Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Variable Scope and Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called inside a loop, but the function itself is defined after the loop. This is not a syntax error, but it's unconventional and can be confusing.
   - The function `func_1` is called with no arguments, but it expects no arguments, which is fine. However, the function is not called correctly in the context of the loop.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then divides this product by each multiplier to get the bets (`vprod`). This approach is not correct because it doesn't ensure that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The condition `if den <= 0` is used to check if there is no valid solution, but this condition is not always correct. The program should check if the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for each possible winning outcome.

3. **Logical Error**:
   - The program assumes that the product of all multipliers and then dividing by each multiplier will always yield a valid solution. This is not necessarily true. For example, if all multipliers are the same, the sum of the bets will be equal to the product, which means the total sum of bets will not be strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to ensure that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. One way to do this is to use a greedy approach where you set the bets in such a way that the sum of bets is just less than the smallest return.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
cases = int(input())
for _ in range(cases):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    
    # Calculate the sum of 1 / (k_i - 1) for all i
    total = sum(1 / (k - 1) for k in vals)
    
    # If the sum is greater than or equal to 1, there is no valid solution
    if total >= 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Calculate the bets
    bets = [1 / (k - 1) for k in vals]
    total_bets = sum(bets)
    
    # Scale the bets to ensure the total sum is just less than 1
    scale_factor = 1 / (total_bets + 1e-9)  # Adding a small epsilon to avoid division by zero
    bets = [int(b * scale_factor * 1e9) for b in bets]
    
    # Ensure the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome
    total_bets = sum(bets)
    if total_bets >= 1e9:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Print the bets
    print(' '.join(map(str, bets)))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Total Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of `1 / (k_i - 1)` for all outcomes. If this sum is greater than or equal to 1, it means there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
- **Scaling Bets**: The program scales the bets to ensure that the total sum of bets is just less than 1. This is done by dividing each bet by the total sum of bets and then multiplying by a large number (1e9) to ensure the bets are integers.
- **Output**: The program prints the bets, ensuring that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

This approach ensures that the program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.
