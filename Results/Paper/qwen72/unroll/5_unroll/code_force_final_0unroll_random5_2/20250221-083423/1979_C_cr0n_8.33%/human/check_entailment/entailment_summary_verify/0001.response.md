### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - This product is used to determine the bets for each outcome. Specifically, the bet for the i-th outcome is calculated as `prod // vals[i]`.

3. **Denominator Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the bets `sum(vprod)`.
   - It then subtracts this sum from the product `prod` to get the denominator `den`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and returns, indicating that no valid distribution of coins is possible.

4. **Output**:
   - If `den` is greater than 0, the program prints the bets `vprod` for each outcome.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The key idea is to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
  - By setting the bet for the i-th outcome as `prod // vals[i]`, the program ensures that the total bet is `sum(vprod)`.
  - The condition `den > 0` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the product `prod`, which is the sum of the potential winnings for each outcome.

- **Mathematical Validity**:
  - The product `prod` of all multipliers is a common multiple of all `k_i`.
  - The bet for the i-th outcome `vprod[i]` is `prod // k_i`, which ensures that the total bet is `sum(vprod)`.
  - The denominator `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`. If `den > 0`, it means that the total bet is strictly less than `prod`, and thus the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If all multipliers are the same, the sum of the bets `sum(vprod)` will be `prod // k * n`, where `k` is the common multiplier and `n` is the number of outcomes.
  - If `k * n >= prod`, then `den` will be less than or equal to 0, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.

- **Output Constraints**:
  - The bets `vprod` are calculated as `prod // k_i`, which ensures that each bet is an integer and within the range `1 <= x_i <= 10^9`.

### Verification of the Approach:

- **Example 1**:
  - `N = 3`, `vals = [3, 2, 7]`
  - `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
  - `vprod = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
  - `den = 42 - 41 = 1` (which is greater than 0)
  - The program outputs `14 21 6`, and the total bet is 41, which is less than the potential winnings for each outcome (42, 42, 42).

- **Example 2**:
  - `N = 2`, `vals = [3, 3]`
  - `prod = 3 * 3 = 9`
  - `vprod = [9 // 3, 9 // 3] = [3, 3]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 3 + 3 = 6`
  - `den = 9 - 6 = 3` (which is greater than 0)
  - The program outputs `3 3`, and the total bet is 6, which is less than the potential winnings for each outcome (9, 9).

- **Example 3**:
  - `N = 5`, `vals = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - `prod = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 3125`
  - `vprod = [3125 // 5, 3125 // 5, 3125 // 5, 3125 // 5, 3125 // 5] = [625, 625, 625, 625, 625]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 625 * 5 = 3125`
  - `den = 3125 - 3125 = 0` (which is not greater than 0)
  - The program correctly outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. It also handles the case where no valid distribution is possible. The approach and the function summary are consistent with the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
