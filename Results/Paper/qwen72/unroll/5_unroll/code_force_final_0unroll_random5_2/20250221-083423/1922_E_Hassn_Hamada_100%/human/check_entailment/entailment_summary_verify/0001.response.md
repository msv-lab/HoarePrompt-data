### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array where the elements are strictly increasing.
   - The array should be such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and calls the function `func_1` with \( n - 1 \) and an empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the sequence that will have exactly \( n \) increasing subsequences.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`.
   - It starts by checking if `number` is 0, in which case it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - It then iterates over possible values of `i` from the maximum value in `sequence` down to 0.
   - For each `i`, it calculates the size and value of a potential subsequence using the expression `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`.
   - It checks if the value of the subsequence is less than or equal to `number` and if so, it updates `size_overlap`.
   - It then appends the calculated sequence of numbers to `sequence`.
   - Finally, it recursively calls `func_1` with the remaining number of increasing subsequences to be generated.

4. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The function `func_1` uses a binary representation approach to generate the sequence.
   - The expression `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` is used to calculate the number of increasing subsequences that can be generated by appending a sequence of length `size - i` starting from `i`.
   - This approach is based on the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in a sequence of length \( k \) is \( 2^k - 1 \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `number` is 0 by returning immediately.
   - The program ensures that the sequence is built correctly and does not exceed the length of 200.
   - The program uses bitwise operations to efficiently calculate the number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Output Verification:**
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated, the program should print `-1`, but it does not explicitly handle this case. However, the function `func_1` is designed to always find a valid sequence for the given range of \( X \).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of `func_1` Logic:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of increasing subsequences using the expression `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`.
  - The function ensures that the sequence is built in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences matches the required `number`.
  - The function uses a greedy approach to find the largest possible subsequence that fits within the remaining `number` and appends it to `sequence`.

- **Handling of Test Cases:**
  - The program processes multiple test cases correctly by reading the number of test cases and iterating over each one.
  - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `result` and calls `func_1` with `n - 1` and `result`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `number` is 0 by returning immediately.
  - The program ensures that the sequence is built correctly and does not exceed the length of 200.
  - The program does not explicitly handle the case where no valid sequence can be generated, but the function `func_1` is designed to always find a valid sequence for the given range of \( X \).

- **Output Format:**
  - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself, which matches the required output format.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly generates an array of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` is designed to handle the generation of the sequence efficiently and within the constraints. The program does not explicitly handle the case where no valid sequence can be generated, but the function `func_1` is designed to always find a valid sequence for the given range of \( X \).

Final: **True**
