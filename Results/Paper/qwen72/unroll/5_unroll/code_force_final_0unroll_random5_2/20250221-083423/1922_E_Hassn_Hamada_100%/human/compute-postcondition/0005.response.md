The objects in the loop head are `i`, `sequence`, and the parameters of the `range` function. For the loop to execute, the `range` function must generate a sequence of numbers, which means the start value of the range must be greater than or equal to -1. The start value is determined by `max(sequence, default=0)`, so `sequence` must be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18
- `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]
- `size_overlap` is (0, 0)

To ensure the loop executes, `sequence` must have at least one element that is greater than or equal to -1, or the `default` value of 0 must be used. This means `max(sequence, default=0)` must be at least 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9] and must have at least one element that is greater than or equal to -1, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`**
