To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the loop and understand its behavior:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `size` is the largest integer such that `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number`.
   - `overlap` is the corresponding index `i` from the sequence that satisfies this condition.
   - `size_overlap` is a tuple `(size, i)`.
   - `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop:**
   ```python
   for i in range(size - overlap):
       sequence.append(i + overlap)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `size - overlap - 1`.
   - In each iteration, it appends `i + overlap` to the `sequence`.
   - Therefore, the loop will append the values `overlap, overlap + 1, overlap + 2, ..., size - 1` to the `sequence`.

4. **Output State:**
   - The `sequence` will have the values `overlap, overlap + 1, overlap + 2, ..., size - 1` appended to it.
   - The values of `size`, `overlap`, and `size_overlap` will remain unchanged.
   - The value of `number` will also remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:

Output State: **`size` remains the same, `overlap` remains the same, `size_overlap` remains the same, `number` remains the same, and `sequence` is extended by the values `overlap, overlap + 1, overlap + 2, ..., size - 1`.**
