To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the expression `size - overlap`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop variable, and it starts at 0 by default in Python's `range` function.
2. **Expression `size - overlap`**: This determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `size - overlap` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `size` is the largest integer such that `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number`
- `overlap` is the corresponding index `i` from the sequence that satisfies this condition
- `size_overlap` is a tuple `(size, i)`
- `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged

We need to ensure that `size - overlap` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this condition.

State: **`size` is the largest integer such that `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number`, `overlap` is the corresponding index `i` from the sequence that satisfies this condition, `size_overlap` is a tuple `(size, i)`, `i` is 0, and `size - overlap` must be greater than 0**
