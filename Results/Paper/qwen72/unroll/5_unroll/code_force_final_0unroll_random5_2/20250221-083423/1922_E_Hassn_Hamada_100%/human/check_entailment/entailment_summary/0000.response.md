Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of generating an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach taken by the program is to use a recursive function `func_1` to build the sequence by appending integers and reducing the target number of subsequences (`number`) accordingly. The key idea is to use powers of 2 to determine how many new increasing subsequences are added with each new element.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Base Case Handling**: The function `func_1` returns `(0, 0)` when `number` is 0. This is not necessary and does not affect the sequence generation, but it is not clear why this tuple is returned. The function should simply return or do nothing when `number` is 0.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `value`**: The calculation of `value` and the condition `while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` are incorrect. The correct calculation for the number of new increasing subsequences added by appending a new element should be based on the binomial coefficients and the number of ways to choose elements from the existing sequence.

3. **Incorrect Sequence Generation**: The sequence generation logic in `func_1` does not correctly ensure that the sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic for appending elements and reducing `number` is flawed, leading to incorrect sequences being generated.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where it is impossible to find an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. For example, if `X` is a prime number greater than 2, it is impossible to construct such an array.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
