The function reads a series of inputs and processes them to output the sum of the first `n` sorted integers from each input list. Specifically, it first reads an integer `num` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a space-separated string of `2n` integers. It then sorts these integers, selects the first `n` of them, sums them, and appends the result to a list `out`. Finally, it prints each element in `out`. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the list `out` to contain the sums for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the variable `out` as a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the sum of the first `n` sorted integers from the input list. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `num` remain unchanged.
