Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then computes a list `p` of `n` integers where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, with `mex` initially set to `n` and updated to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` in each iteration. The function prints the final values of `p` for each test case. **
