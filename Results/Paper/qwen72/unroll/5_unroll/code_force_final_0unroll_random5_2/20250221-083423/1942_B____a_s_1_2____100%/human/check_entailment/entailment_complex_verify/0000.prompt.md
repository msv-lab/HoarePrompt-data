You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

    #State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data. For each test case, p is a list of n integers where each p_i is calculated as p[i] = mex - a[i] and mex is updated to be the minimum of mex and p[i], starting with mex = n. The final values of p for each test case are printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then computes a list `p` of `n` integers where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, with `mex` initially set to `n` and updated to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` in each iteration. The function prints the final values of `p` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly constructs a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` for each test case. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The permutation `p` is initialized with `-1` for all positions.
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for the MEX of the permutation.

3. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program iterates from the last element of `a` to the first element.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation `p` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:
- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
  - The program ensures that `mex` is always the correct MEX for the current prefix of `p` by updating it in each iteration.

- **Permutation Validity**:
  - The program constructs `p` such that `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` holds true for each `i`.
  - By starting from the end and working backwards, the program ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated and used to construct `p`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly.
  - It also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, as the MEX calculation and permutation construction are robust to these values.

Since the program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for every potential case and the provided logic aligns with the problem description, the program is correct.
