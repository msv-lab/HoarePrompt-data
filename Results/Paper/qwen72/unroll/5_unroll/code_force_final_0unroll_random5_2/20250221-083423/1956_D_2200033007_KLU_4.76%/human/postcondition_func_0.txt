The function `func_1` accepts a list `c` of integers, where the length of the list is between 1 and 18, and each element in the list is between 0 and 10^7. It prints either "4 1" followed by "1 2" if the length of `c` is 2, or "13 0" if the length of `c` is not 2. The function does not return any value.
