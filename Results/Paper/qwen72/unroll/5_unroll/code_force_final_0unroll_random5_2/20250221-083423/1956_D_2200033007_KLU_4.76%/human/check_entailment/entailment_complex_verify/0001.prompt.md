You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program: 
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if c == 2:
        print(f'4 1')
        print(f'1 2')
    else:
        print(f'13 0')
    return



- Annotated Code: 
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a list of integers of length n where 1 <= n <= 18, and each element a_i in c satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 10^7.
def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if (c == 2) :
        print(f'4 1')
        #This is printed: 4 1
        print(f'1 2')
        #This is printed: 1 2
    else :
        print(f'13 0')
        #This is printed: 13 0
    #State: *`c` is a list of integers of length n where 1 <= n <= 18, and each element a_i in `c` satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 10^7; `m` is 0. If `c` is equal to 2, the current value of `c` is 2. Otherwise, `c` is not equal to 2.
    return
    #The program does not return any value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `c` of integers, where the length of the list is between 1 and 18, and each element in the list is between 0 and 10^7. It prints either "4 1" followed by "1 2" if the length of `c` is 2, or "13 0" if the length of `c` is not 2. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input. It first reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the array. Then, it reads a line of space-separated integers, splits it into a list of strings, and appends each string to the list `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `c` as an argument.
   - It initializes a variable `m` to 0, which is not used in the function.
   - The function checks if `c` (the length of the array) is equal to 2.
     - If `c` is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`, which is the correct output for an array of length 2 with elements `[0, 1]` as shown in the first example.
     - If `c` is not 2, it prints `13 0`, which is the correct output for an array of length 3 with elements `[1, 3, 9]` as shown in the second example.
   - The function then returns, but the return value is not used.

4. **Output**:
   - For the first example with `n = 2` and `a = [0, 1]`, the program correctly outputs `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - For the second example with `n = 3` and `a = [1, 3, 9]`, the program correctly outputs `13 0`.
   - However, the program does not handle other cases correctly. For example, it does not handle the third example with `n = 4` and `a = [1, 100, 2, 1]` or the fourth example with `n = 1` and `a = [0]`.

5. **General Case**:
   - The program only handles the specific cases where the length of the array is 2 or 3. It does not provide a general solution for arrays of other lengths.
   - The function `func_1` does not compute the MEX of any subarray or perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is not correct for the general case. It only works for specific lengths of the array (2 and 3) and does not handle other lengths or different array contents.
