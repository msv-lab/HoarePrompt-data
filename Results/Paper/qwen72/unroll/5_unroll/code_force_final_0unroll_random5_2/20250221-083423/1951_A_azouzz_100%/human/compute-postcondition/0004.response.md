Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the input. The function then checks the string `s` for specific conditions related to the count of '1' characters and the presence of the substring '11'. Based on these conditions, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. The values of `start` and `end` (if they exist in the calling context) remain unchanged. **
