Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game's logic where Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. The function `func_1` only counts how many pairs of cards you have, but it does not simulate the game to ensure that you are taking turns optimally and Nene is playing optimally to counter your moves. 

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
1 1 2 3
```
The expected output is `1`, but the program will output `1` because it only counts the pairs in your hand without considering the optimal play by Nene. However, the program does not account for the fact that Nene will play her cards in a way that minimizes your score. In this case, Nene can play her cards such that you only get 1 point, which is correct. But the program does not simulate the game to ensure this.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players. The current implementation is incomplete and does not handle the game's dynamics as described.
