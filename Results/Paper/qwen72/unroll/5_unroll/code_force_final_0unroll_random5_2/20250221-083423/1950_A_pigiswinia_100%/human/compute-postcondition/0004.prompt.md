You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of three digits (a, b, c) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has printed 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each test case (a, b, c) based on the conditions provided. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will have their final values set to the last input values read in the last iteration of the loop, and the loop counter `i` will have the value `t-1`. All other variables that were part of the initial state but not modified within the loop will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of three digits (a, b, c) with 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and the number of test cases is an integer 1 <= t <= 1000. It returns a list of results for each test case, based on the values of a, b, and c.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
