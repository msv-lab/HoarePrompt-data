### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to reconstruct a string `s` from the trace array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty string `s` and a list `char_count` of 26 zeros, which will keep track of the number of times each character from 'a' to 'z' has been used in the string `s`.

3. **Reconstruction Logic:**
   - For each index `i` in the trace array `a`, the function looks for the first character (from 'a' to 'z') whose count in `char_count` matches `a[i]`.
   - Once it finds such a character, it appends it to the string `s` and increments the count for that character in `char_count`.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The function ensures that the character appended to `s` at position `i` has appeared exactly `a[i]` times before in the string.
   - This is achieved by the inner loop that iterates over the 26 possible characters and finds the first one whose count matches `a[i]`.
   - The function guarantees that a valid character will always be found because the problem statement ensures that a suitable string `s` exists for the given trace.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns a string `s` of length `n` that matches the given trace array `a`.
   - The string `s` is composed of characters from 'a' to 'z', which is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs a string `s` from the given trace array `a` for each test case. The logic is sound and adheres to the problem constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
