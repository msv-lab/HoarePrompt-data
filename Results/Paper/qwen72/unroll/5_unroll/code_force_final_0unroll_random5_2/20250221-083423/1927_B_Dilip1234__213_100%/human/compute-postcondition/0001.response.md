Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, `s` is an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros.**

The variable `char_count` is initialized as a list containing 26 zeros. The values of `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.
