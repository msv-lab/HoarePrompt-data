The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list (`n`).
- `n` is equal to the length of `nums`.
- `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`.
- `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`).
- `total % n == 0`.
- `curr` is 0.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list (`n`), `n` is equal to the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`), `total % n == 0`, `curr` is 0, `i` is 0**
