### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If true, it prints "STAIR".
   - It then checks if `a == b == c` to determine if all digits are the same. If true, it prints "NONE".
   - Next, it checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits using `max(a, b, c) == b`. If true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The condition `a < b < c` correctly identifies a stair.
   - The condition `a == b == c` correctly identifies when all digits are the same, which should be "NONE".
   - The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` correctly identifies a peak. This is because `b` being the maximum means `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, which satisfies the peak condition `a < b > c`.
   - The else condition correctly handles all other cases, which should be "NONE".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`).
   - It also handles cases where `b` is not the maximum but the digits do not form a stair (e.g., `4 1 7`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all the specified conditions and edge cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
