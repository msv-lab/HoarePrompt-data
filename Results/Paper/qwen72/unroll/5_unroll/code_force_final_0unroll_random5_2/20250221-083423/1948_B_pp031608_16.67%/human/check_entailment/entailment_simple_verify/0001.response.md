### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length `n` of the array and the array itself. This part of the program is accurate.

2. **Initial Check**: The program uses the function `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted. This function compares the original list with its sorted version and returns `True` if they are the same, indicating the array is sorted. This is a correct approach for checking if the array is sorted.

3. **Transformation Logic**: The program iterates through the array and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than 10. If both conditions are met, it performs the operation of splitting the current element into its digits and inserting them back into the array. However, this logic has several issues:
   - **Single Pass Transformation**: The program only performs the transformation once per element and does not account for the possibility that further transformations might be needed to sort the array. For example, in the array `[12, 3, 28, 5]`, splitting `12` into `[1, 2]` results in `[1, 2, 3, 28, 5]`, which is still unsorted. The program does not continue to check and transform `28` into `[2, 8]` to achieve a sorted array.
   - **Incorrect Transformation Order**: The program splits the element and inserts the digits in the same position, but it does not handle the case where the split might create a new unsorted condition. This can lead to incorrect results.
   - **Infinite Loop Potential**: If the transformation is not done correctly, the program might enter an infinite loop where it keeps trying to sort the array without success. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed.

4. **Re-evaluation**: After performing the transformation, the program re-evaluates the array using `func_1` to check if it is now sorted. However, due to the issues in the transformation logic, this re-evaluation might not be meaningful if the array is not fully transformed.

5. **Output**: Based on the result of `func_1`, the program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted, and 'No' otherwise. This part of the program is correct, but the transformation logic needs to be fixed to ensure the array is properly evaluated.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the transformation logic. The program does not handle multiple transformations correctly and can potentially enter an infinite loop. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
