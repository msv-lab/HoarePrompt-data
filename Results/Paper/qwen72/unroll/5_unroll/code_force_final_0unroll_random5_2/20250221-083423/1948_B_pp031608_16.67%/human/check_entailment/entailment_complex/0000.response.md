Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length `n` of the array and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Sorting Check Function**: The function `func_1` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. This is a correct and efficient way to check if a list is sorted.

3. **Operation Application**: The program iterates through the list `list1` and checks if the current element is less than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than or equal to 10. If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the list.

4. **Final Check**: After applying the operations, the program checks if the modified list `list1` is sorted using `func_1`. If it is, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Infinite Loop Potential**: The program does not guarantee that the array will become sorted after a finite number of operations. For example, if the array is `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will repeatedly split `12` into `1` and `2`, but it will never be able to sort the array because `28` will always be out of order.

- **Incorrect Operation Application**: The program only applies the operation to the previous element if the current element is less than the previous element. This is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted. The operation should be applied to any element that is greater than or equal to 10, regardless of its position relative to the current element.

- **Order of Operations**: The program modifies the list while iterating over it, which can lead to unexpected behavior. For example, if the list is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will split `12` into `1` and `2`, but it will not re-evaluate the new list correctly.

To fix these issues, the program should:

- Apply the operation to all elements greater than or equal to 10 in a single pass.
- Check if the resulting list is sorted after all possible operations have been applied.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
