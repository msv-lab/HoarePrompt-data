Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the standard input, which represents the number of test cases to process, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. It then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value, and the value of `t` remains unchanged after the function execution. No other variables are affected by the function. **
