You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20 and `password` consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits). It returns 'NO' if the letters in `password` are not sorted, if the digits in `password` are not sorted, or if any letter in `password` is immediately followed by a digit. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Condition 1**: The program implicitly checks that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits by using the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` methods. If a character is neither a digit nor a lowercase letter, it will not be added to the `letters` or `digits` lists, and the program will still correctly determine the password's strength based on the remaining conditions.

2. **Condition 2**: The program ensures that there is no digit that comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking if a letter is followed by a digit. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Condition 3**: The program checks if all digits in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version. If they are not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Condition 4**: The program checks if all letters in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version. If they are not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

The program handles all edge cases, such as:
- Passwords with only letters.
- Passwords with only digits.
- Passwords with a mix of letters and digits.
- Passwords of length 1.
- Passwords where letters and digits are intermixed but still meet the conditions.

Given the problem description and the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
