The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums` representing the amounts of water in `n` containers. The function checks if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element in `nums` is zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, and the state of the variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` is undefined after the function completes.
