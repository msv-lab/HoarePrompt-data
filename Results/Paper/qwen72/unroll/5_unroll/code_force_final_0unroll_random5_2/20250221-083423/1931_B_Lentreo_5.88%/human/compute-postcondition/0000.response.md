Output State: **t is an integer input by the user, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of containers; a is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
