The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function operates on multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of containers, and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case. The exact return value is not specified in the output, but it is expected to provide some form of output based on the input parameters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` and a list `a` of `n` integers representing the amounts of water in `n` containers. For each test case, it returns a result based on the input parameters.**
