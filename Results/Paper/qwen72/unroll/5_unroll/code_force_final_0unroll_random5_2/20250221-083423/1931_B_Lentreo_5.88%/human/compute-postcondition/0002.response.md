Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. After processing, the variable `curr` is either 0 or a non-zero value, and the loop prints 'YES' if `curr` is 0, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` are reset for each iteration, and the final state of these variables is undefined after the loop completes. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5, and the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n` for each test case.**
