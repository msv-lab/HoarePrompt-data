Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect. The logic used to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers is flawed. The program calculates the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element in `nums` (`last`). However, this approach does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the water can be redistributed such that each container ends up with the average amount of water. Since the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, the average amount of water per container is an integer. The key is to ensure that we can pour water from containers with more than the average to containers with less than the average, always respecting the condition that `i < j`.

The correct approach involves:
1. Calculating the average amount of water per container.
2. Checking if the total amount of water that needs to be poured out from containers with more than the average is equal to the total amount of water that needs to be poured into containers with less than the average.

The given program does not perform these steps. Instead, it calculates a sum of differences that does not reflect the required redistribution logic.

Correctness: **False**
