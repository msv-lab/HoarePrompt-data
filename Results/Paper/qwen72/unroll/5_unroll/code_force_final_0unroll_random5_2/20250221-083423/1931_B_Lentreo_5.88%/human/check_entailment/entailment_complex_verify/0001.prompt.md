You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of containers. a is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. After processing, the variable `curr` is either 0 or a non-zero value, and the loop prints 'YES' if `curr` is 0, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` are reset for each iteration, and the final state of these variables is undefined after the loop completes. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums` representing the amounts of water in `n` containers. The function checks if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element in `nums` is zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, and the state of the variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` is undefined after the function completes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given `n` containers with initial water amounts `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of all water amounts is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the described operations.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If the sum of all water amounts is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container is `sum(a) / n`.
   - To achieve this, we need to ensure that we can always pour water from a container with more water to a container with less water until all containers have the target amount.
   - The operation `i < j` ensures that we can only pour water from a container to a container that is to its right.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the initial water amounts `nums`.
   - It then calculates the difference between each container's water amount and the last container's water amount, summing these differences in `curr`.
   - If `curr` is zero, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Flaws in the Program**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the last container's water amount (`last`) should be the target amount for all containers. This is not necessarily true.
   - The correct target amount should be `sum(nums) / n`.
   - The program does not check if the water can be evenly distributed by the allowed operations.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the target amount of water for each container, which is `sum(nums) / n`.
   - Check if it is possible to pour water from containers with more water to containers with less water such that all containers eventually have the target amount.
   - Since the sum of water amounts is divisible by `n`, the target amount is an integer.
   - We need to ensure that the water can be redistributed without violating the `i < j` constraint.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it uses an incorrect target amount and does not properly check the feasibility of the operations.
