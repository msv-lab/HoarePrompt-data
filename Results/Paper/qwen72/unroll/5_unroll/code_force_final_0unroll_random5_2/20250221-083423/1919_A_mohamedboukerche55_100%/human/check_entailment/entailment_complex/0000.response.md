### Reasoning:

The problem description outlines a game where Alice and Bob take turns, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses. The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins in both wallets. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Turns and Moves**:
   - Alice starts the game.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - Each player must then remove 1 coin from their current wallet, and the wallet must have at least 1 coin before this step.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - The player who cannot remove a coin (because their wallet is empty) loses.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, the game will end in a state where both wallets are empty, and Bob will be the last player to make a move. This is because the number of moves required to empty both wallets is (a + b - 2) / 2, which is an integer if (a + b) is even.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, the game will end in a state where one wallet is empty and the other has 1 coin, and Alice will be the last player to make a move. This is because the number of moves required to empty both wallets is (a + b - 1) / 2, which is an integer if (a + b) is odd.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
   - The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and the examples provided.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
