Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.** 

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def func(a, b):
```

This ensures that the function can accept the required input parameters.
