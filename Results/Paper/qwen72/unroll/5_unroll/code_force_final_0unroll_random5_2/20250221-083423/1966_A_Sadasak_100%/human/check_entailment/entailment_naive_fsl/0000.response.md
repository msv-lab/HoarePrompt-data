Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
5
```

The program incorrectly prints `5` instead of `2`. The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function and the main loop. The function `func_1` is supposed to count the frequency of each number in the list, but it incorrectly limits the frequency to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. Additionally, the main loop does not correctly handle the case where the frequency of a number is exactly `k` or a multiple of `k`.

A correct approach would involve counting the frequencies of each number and then determining the minimum number of cards left by considering how many operations can be performed based on these frequencies. The program should be able to handle cases where the frequency of a number is a multiple of `k` and where it is not.
