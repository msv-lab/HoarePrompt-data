Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange value `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Special Case Handling**: If `k` is greater than `n`, the program correctly prints `n` because no exchange can be performed. This is a valid and correct handling of the special case.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in the list `nums` and caps the frequency at `k`. This is done to ensure that the frequency of any card number does not exceed the number of cards that can be exchanged in one operation.

4. **Output Logic**:
   - If any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is because you can exchange `k` cards of the same number for `k - 1` new cards, and the remaining cards will be `k - 1`.
   - If no card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`, the program prints `n`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of performing multiple exchanges to reduce the number of cards further.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first example case (5 3, 4 1 1 4 4), the program should output 2, which is correct.
   - For the second example case (1 10, 7), the program should output 1, which is correct.
   - For the third example case (7 2, 4 2 1 100 5 2 3), the program should output 1, which is correct.
   - For the fourth example case (10 4, 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1), the program should output 3, which is correct.
   - For the fifth example case (5 2, 3 8 1 48 7), the program should output 5, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1 because you can exchange the two 1s and the two 8s, leaving you with 1 card.
   - For the sixth example case (6 2, 10 20 30 10 20 40), the program should output 1, which is correct.
   - For the seventh example case (6 3, 10 20 30 10 20 40), the program should output 6, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 2 because you can exchange the three 10s and the three 20s, leaving you with 2 cards.

The program fails to correctly handle cases where multiple exchanges can reduce the number of cards further. The logic to check if any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k` is insufficient to determine the minimum number of cards left.

Correctness: **False**
