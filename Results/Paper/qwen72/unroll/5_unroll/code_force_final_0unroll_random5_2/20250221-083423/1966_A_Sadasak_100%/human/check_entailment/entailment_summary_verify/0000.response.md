### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Let's break down the issues and the expected behavior step by step.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to create a frequency table of the numbers in the list `arr`, but it caps the frequency at `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is incorrect because the frequency of a number can be greater than `k`, and we need to consider the exact frequency to determine the minimum number of cards left.
   - The function should simply count the frequencies of each number without any capping.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in the program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility that the frequency of a number can be a multiple of `k` or greater than `k`.
   - The correct approach should involve:
     - Counting the frequencies of each number.
     - For each frequency, determining how many operations can be performed and how many cards will be left after these operations.
     - Summing the remaining cards for all numbers to get the minimum number of cards left.

3. **Example Case**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     5 3
     4 1 1 4 4
     ```
   - The correct output should be `2` because:
     - The frequency of `4` is `3`, so we can perform one operation to exchange these 3 cards for 2 new cards.
     - The frequency of `1` is `2`, so we cannot perform any operation on these cards.
     - After the operation, we have 2 new cards and 2 cards with `1`, totaling 4 cards.
     - Since we cannot perform any more operations, the minimum number of cards left is `2`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each number, calculate the number of operations that can be performed by dividing the frequency by `k`.
   - The remaining cards for each number will be the frequency modulo `k`.
   - Sum the remaining cards for all numbers to get the minimum number of cards left.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the cases where the frequency of a number is greater than or equal to `k`. The function `func_1` should not cap the frequency at `k`, and the main logic should correctly calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

Final: **False**
