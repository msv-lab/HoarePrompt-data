**Reasoning:**

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cards left in a hand after performing the specified operations. Let's break down the logic and check if it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n` because it is impossible to perform any operation (since you need at least `k` cards to perform an operation).

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in `nums` and caps the frequency at `k`. This is done to ensure that the frequency table only contains the maximum possible number of cards that can be exchanged in a single operation.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks if any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`.
   - If such a card number exists, it prints `k - 1` because you can exchange `k` cards of the same number for `k - 1` new cards.
   - If no card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`, it prints `n` (the original number of cards).

However, the logic in the main part of the program is flawed. The correct approach should be to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally. Specifically, the program should consider the following:

- **Optimal Reduction:**
  - For each card number, if its frequency is a multiple of `k`, you can reduce it to `0` cards.
  - If the frequency is not a multiple of `k`, you can reduce it to the remainder when divided by `k`.

The current logic only checks if any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k` and prints `k - 1` if so. This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of cards left. For example, if the frequency of a card number is `2k`, the program should reduce it to `0` cards, but it does not handle this case correctly.

**Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the optimal reduction of card frequencies, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
