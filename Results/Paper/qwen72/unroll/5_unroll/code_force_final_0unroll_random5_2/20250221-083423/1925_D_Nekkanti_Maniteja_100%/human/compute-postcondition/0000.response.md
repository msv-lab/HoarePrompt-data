The loop head involves the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be at least 1, because the loop will run `int(input())` times. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

Given the constraints and the function `func` expectations, the input from `int(input())` should represent the number of test cases `t`, which must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `t` is at least 1 and `i` is 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be at least 1**
