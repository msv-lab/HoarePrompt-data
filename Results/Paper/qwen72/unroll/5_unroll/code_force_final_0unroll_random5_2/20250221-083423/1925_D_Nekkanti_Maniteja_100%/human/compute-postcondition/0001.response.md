Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `s` will contain the final computed value of the sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `c` will retain their initial values, and the variable `a` will be the sum of all initial friendship values `f_i` for the pairs of friends.**

Here is a detailed breakdown of the final state of the variables:
- `n`: The number of children, unchanged.
- `m`: The number of pairs of friends, unchanged.
- `k`: The number of excursions, unchanged.
- `M`: The modulo value \(10^9 + 7\), unchanged.
- `c`: The modular inverse of the number of possible pairs of children, unchanged.
- `a`: The sum of all initial friendship values `f_i` for the pairs of friends.
- `s`: The final computed value of the sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The loop iterates over the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes the inputs and computes the final value of `s` based on the given formula. The value of `s` is updated in each iteration of the inner loop, and the final value of `s` is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
