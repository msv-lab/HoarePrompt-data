The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (i.e., not 0), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is the input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

State: **The list of test cases remains unchanged, `n` is the input integer and `n` must be non-zero**
