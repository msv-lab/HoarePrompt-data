The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of 2n integers, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the integers at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). It then appends this sum to a list `final`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element of `final`, one per line. The function does not return any value.
