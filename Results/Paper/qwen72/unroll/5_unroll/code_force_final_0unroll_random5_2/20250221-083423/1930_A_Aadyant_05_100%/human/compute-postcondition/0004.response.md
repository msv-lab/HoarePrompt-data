The only object in the loop head is the variable `fin` and the list `final`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `final` list. If the `final` list has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the `final` list must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`final` is a list that must contain at least 1 element, `fin` is the first element in the `final` list**
