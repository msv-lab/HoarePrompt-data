### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers. However, the variable `a` is read but not used, which is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of integers. This is a crucial step because to maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available integers together. By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest integers are paired first, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values in each pair.

3. **Summing the Minimum Values**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair (which is the smaller one due to sorting) to the score `s`.
   - This approach is correct because the sum of the minimum values of each pair will always be maximized when the list is sorted.

4. **Output**:
   - The program appends the final score for each test case to a list `final`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the scores one by one.

### Potential Issues:
- **Type Conversion**:
  - The program converts the input `n` and the list of integers correctly.
  - It splits the input `b` into a list of strings and then converts each string to an integer, which is also correct.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly.
  - It also handles the case where all integers are the same correctly.

- **Unnecessary Variable**:
  - The variable `a` is read but not used. This is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic to solve the problem. It reads the input correctly, sorts the list, and sums the minimum values of each pair to achieve the maximum score. The output is also handled correctly. The only minor issue is the unnecessary reading of the variable `a`, but this does not impact the correctness of the solution.

### Correctness:
