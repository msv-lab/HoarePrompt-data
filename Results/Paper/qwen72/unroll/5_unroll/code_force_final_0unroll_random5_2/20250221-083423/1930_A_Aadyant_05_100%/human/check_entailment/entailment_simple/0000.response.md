### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **List Construction**: For each test case, the program reads the number of integers `n` and then reads the 2n integers as a single input string. It splits this string into a list of strings and converts each string to an integer, storing them in `list2`. This is also correct according to the problem description.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts `list2` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because, to maximize the score, we need to pair the smallest numbers together. By sorting, we ensure that the smallest numbers are at the even indices when we iterate through the list.

4. **Score Calculation**: The program iterates through the sorted list `list2` in steps of 2, adding the integer at each even index to the score `s`. This is correct because, in a sorted list, the even indices will always contain the smaller number of each pair, and we need to add the minimum of each pair to the score.

5. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the program prints the final scores for each test case. This is consistent with the problem's output requirements.

### Potential Issues:
- **Variable Naming**: The variable `a` is read but not used, which is unnecessary and can be removed.
- **Function Signature**: The function `func` does not take any parameters, which is not ideal for testing or reusability. It should take `t` and the list of test cases as parameters.

### Correctness:
Despite the minor issues with variable naming and function signature, the core logic of the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

**Correctness: True**
