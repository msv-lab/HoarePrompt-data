The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might be designed to handle multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function is expected to return a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

The function likely processes each test case and returns a result for each one. Since the exact output for each test case is not specified, we can only infer that the function returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30), and returns a result for each test case.**
