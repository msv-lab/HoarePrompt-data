Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. There are a few issues:

1. **Variable Naming and Usage**: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are used incorrectly. According to the problem description, `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion. However, in the program, the variables are assigned as `(a, b, c)`, which does not match the problem description. The correct assignment should be `(n, a, b)`.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. The program attempts to compare `a * b` with `a * d`, where `d` is `c / 2`. This does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. Instead, the program should:
   - Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price.
   - Calculate the cost of buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - Sum these costs to get the minimum total cost.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price
        pairs_cost = (n // 2) * b
        # Calculate the cost of buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price
        single_cost = (n % 2) * a
        # Total minimum cost
        total_cost = pairs_cost + single_cost
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum cost for each test case.
