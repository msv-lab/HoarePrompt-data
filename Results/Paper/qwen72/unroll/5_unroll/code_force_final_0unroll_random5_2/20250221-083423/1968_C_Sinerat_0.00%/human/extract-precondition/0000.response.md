Precondition: **The function `func` should take an integer `t` as the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` where `2 <= n <= 500` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and the list `x`.

Given the provided function definition `def func():`, it does not accept any parameters, which is not suitable for the problem described. The correct function definition should include parameters to handle the input as described.
