Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial value of `a[0]` is set to 500. This value is not always appropriate to ensure that the conditions \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) are met for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
2 4 1
```

The program will output:
```
500 502 506 507
```

However, this output does not satisfy the conditions:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 502 \bmod 500 = 2 \) (correct)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 506 \bmod 502 = 4 \) (correct)
- \( a_4 \bmod a_3 = 507 \bmod 506 = 1 \) (correct)

But if we consider a different input:
```
1
3
1 5
```

The program will output:
```
500 501 506
```

This output does not satisfy the conditions:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 501 \bmod 500 = 1 \) (correct)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 506 \bmod 501 = 5 \) (correct)

However, if we change the initial value of `a[0]` to a different number, the program might fail. For instance, if we use the input:
```
1
3
1 5
```

And set `a[0] = 10`:
```
10 11 16
```

This output satisfies the conditions:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 11 \bmod 10 = 1 \) (correct)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 16 \bmod 11 = 5 \) (correct)

But the program always sets `a[0] = 500`, which is not a general solution and can lead to incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
