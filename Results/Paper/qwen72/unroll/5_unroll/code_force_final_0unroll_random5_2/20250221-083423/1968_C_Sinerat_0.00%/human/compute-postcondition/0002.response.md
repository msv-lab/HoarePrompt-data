The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `x`. The constraints are `2 <= n <= 500` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

The function returns the result for each test case based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints and relationships. Therefore, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` with constraints `2 <= n <= 500` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters.**
