You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` from user input. It then generates a list `a` of length `n` where `a[0]` is always 500, and for each subsequent index `i` (1 ≤ i < n), `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` from `x[0]` to `x[i-1]`, added to 500. The function prints the list `a` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`**:
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 500. This is a valid choice because `1 <= a[0] <= 10^9` and the problem does not specify any particular value for `a[0]`.

2. **Construction of `a[i]`**:
   - The program constructs the array `a` such that `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]` for all `1 <= i < n`.
   - This ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]` because `a[i]` is exactly `a[i-1]` plus `x[i-1]`, which means the remainder when `a[i]` is divided by `a[i-1]` is `x[i-1]`.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The problem states that `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`.
   - Since `a[0]` is 500, and each subsequent `a[i]` is constructed by adding a value between 1 and 500 to the previous `a[i-1]`, the values of `a[i]` will always be within the range `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed array `a` for each test case, which satisfies the conditions given in the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly. For example, if `x = [500]`, the program will output `500 1000`, which satisfies `a[2] % a[1] = 1000 % 500 = 500`.

6. **Multiple Solutions**:
   - The problem allows for multiple valid solutions, and the program provides one valid solution by always starting with `a[0] = 500` and constructing subsequent values as `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
