You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` should take an integer `t` as the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` where `2 <= n <= 500` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 500
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output state is a list `a` of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `1 <= i < n` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` starting from `x[0]` up to `x[i-1]`, added to 500.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial value of `a[0]` is set to 500. This value is not always appropriate to ensure that the conditions \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) are met for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
2 4 1
```

The program will output:
```
500 502 506 507
```

However, this output does not satisfy the conditions:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 502 \bmod 500 = 2 \) (correct)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 506 \bmod 502 = 4 \) (correct)
- \( a_4 \bmod a_3 = 507 \bmod 506 = 1 \) (correct)

But if we consider a different input:
```
1
3
1 5
```

The program will output:
```
500 501 506
```

This output does not satisfy the conditions:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 501 \bmod 500 = 1 \) (correct)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 506 \bmod 501 = 5 \) (correct)

However, if we change the initial value of `a[0]` to a different number, the program might fail. For instance, if we use the input:
```
1
3
1 5
```

And set `a[0] = 10`:
```
10 11 16
```

This output satisfies the conditions:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 11 \bmod 10 = 1 \) (correct)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 16 \bmod 11 = 5 \) (correct)

But the program always sets `a[0] = 500`, which is not a general solution and can lead to incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
