You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the integer `n` and the two strings `row1` and `row2` which represent the arrows in the grid.

2. **Test Case Storage**: The program stores each test case as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` in a list `test_cases`, which is then passed to the function `func_1`.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case and determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

4. **Initialization**: The function initializes two boolean variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to track whether the robot can be in the first or second row, respectively. Initially, the robot is in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `True` and `reachable_second_row` is set to `False`.

5. **Loop Through Columns**: The function iterates through each column from 1 to `n` (0-indexed, so from 0 to `n-1`).

6. **First Row Check**:
   - If the robot is currently in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell of the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it can move to the second row and the target cell `(2, n)` is reachable, so `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`.
     - If the arrow in the current cell of the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - The robot can no longer stay in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
       - If the robot is not in the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the current cell of the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), the robot can move to the second row, so `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`.

7. **Second Row Check**:
   - If the robot is currently in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell of the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), the target cell `(2, n)` is reachable, so `reachable_second_row` remains `True`.

8. **Result Collection**: After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`, so the function appends 'YES' to the results list. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

9. **Output**: The main block of the program prints the results for each test case.

However, there are a few issues in the logic:
- The condition `if j == n - 1` inside the first row check is incorrect. The robot should be able to move to the second row as soon as it reaches the last column, not just when the arrow points to the right.
- The condition `if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>'` inside the first row check is also incorrect. The robot should be able to move to the second row if the arrow in the second row points to the right, regardless of the current column.

Let's correct these issues:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                    else:
                        reachable_second_row = row2[j] == '>'
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_second_row = False
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

With these corrections, the logic should be:
- If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points to the right, it can move to the second row.
- If the robot is in the second row and the arrow points to the right, it can continue moving to the right.

Now, let's re-evaluate the correctness:

1. **First Example**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `row1 = ">><<"`
   - `row2 = ">>><"`
   - The robot can move as follows: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4). The target cell is reachable, so the output is `YES`.

2. **Second Example**:
   - `n = 2`
   - `row1 = "><"`
   - `row2 = "><"`
   - The robot can move as follows: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2). The target cell is reachable, so the output is `YES`.

3. **Third Example**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `row1 = ">>><"`
   - `row2 = ">><<"`
   - The robot can move as follows: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4). It cannot move to the second row, so the target cell is not reachable, and the output is `NO`.

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - `n = 6`
   - `row1 = ">><<><"`
   - `row2 = "><>>><"`
   - The robot can move as follows: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6). The target cell is reachable, so the output is `YES`.

Given the corrected logic, the program should now produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
