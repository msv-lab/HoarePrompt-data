Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

In this case, the robot can indeed reach the cell (2, 4) with the following path:
1. Start at (1, 1)
2. Move right to (1, 2) (arrow in (1, 1) points right)
3. Move down to (2, 2) (arrow in (1, 2) points left)
4. Move right to (2, 3) (arrow in (2, 2) points right)
5. Move right to (2, 4) (arrow in (2, 3) points right)

However, the program incorrectly determines that the robot cannot reach (2, 4). The issue lies in the way the program updates the `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` flags, which do not accurately reflect the robot's movement and the conditions for reaching the target cell.
