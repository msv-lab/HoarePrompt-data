Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even) and two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. results is a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether it is possible to reach the second row from the first row for each test case.**
