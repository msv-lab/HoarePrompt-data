### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to calculate the sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to \( n \) for each test case.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, and for each test case, we need to compute the sum of the digit sums of the numbers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program starts by initializing a variable `soma` to 0, which will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums.
   - It reads an integer \( N \) from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and iterates from 0 to \( n-1 \) (inclusive).
   - For each number \( i \) in this range, it calls `func_1(i)` to compute the sum of the digits of \( i \) and adds this value to `soma`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the value of `soma`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program iterates from 0 to \( n-1 \) instead of from 1 to \( n \). This means it is missing the digit sum of \( n \) itself.
   - The variable `soma` is not reset to 0 after each test case, so the sum from previous test cases is carried over to the next test case.
   - The program prints the cumulative sum of all test cases at the end, rather than printing the sum for each test case individually.

4. **Correcting the Issues:**
   - The loop should iterate from 1 to \( n \) (inclusive) to include the digit sum of \( n \).
   - The variable `soma` should be reset to 0 at the beginning of each test case.
   - The sum for each test case should be printed immediately after it is computed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues identified. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
