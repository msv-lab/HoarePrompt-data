Correctness: **False**

**Reason:**
1. The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. According to the problem description, the first line of input should be the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent test case should be processed independently. However, the program reads `N` as the number of test cases and then processes `N` numbers, which is incorrect.
2. The program does not reset the `soma` variable for each test case, so the sum from previous test cases will accumulate, leading to incorrect results.
3. The program should print the sum for each test case separately, but it prints the total sum only once at the end.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

This corrected version:
1. Reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line of input.
2. Processes each test case independently by resetting `soma` to 0 for each test case.
3. Prints the sum for each test case separately.
