Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the transition from 24-hour to 12-hour format correctly for the hour `12`. Specifically, the program incorrectly classifies `12:00` as `12:00 AM` instead of `12:00 PM`. Additionally, the program does not handle the hour `00` correctly, as it should be `12:00 AM` in the 12-hour format, not `12:00 PM`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = input().split(':')
        h = int(h)
        if h >= 12:
            time = 'PM'
            if h > 12:
                h1 = str(h - 12).zfill(2)
            else:
                h1 = '12'
        else:
            time = 'AM'
            if h == 0:
                h1 = '12'
            else:
                h1 = str(h).zfill(2)
        print(f"{h1}:{m} {time}")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the transition from 24-hour to 12-hour format for all hours, including `00` and `12`.
