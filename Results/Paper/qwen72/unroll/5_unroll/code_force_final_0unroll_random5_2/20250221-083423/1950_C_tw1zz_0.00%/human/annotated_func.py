#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where `hh` is the hour (00 to 23) and `mm` is the minute (00 to 59). The input string `s` is always a valid time in 24-hour format. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440).

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the input time in 24-hour format will be converted to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and printed. The variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will be updated for each iteration based on the input time, but their values will not persist outside the loop. After all iterations, the loop will have completed and the program will terminate.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm" where `hh` is the hour (00 to 23) and `mm` is the minute (00 to 59). The function converts each input time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and prints the converted time. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all `t` test cases, the function terminates.
