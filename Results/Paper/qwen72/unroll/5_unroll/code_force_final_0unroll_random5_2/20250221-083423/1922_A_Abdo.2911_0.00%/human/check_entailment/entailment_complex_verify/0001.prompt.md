You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. After processing, it will print 'YES' if the conditions for `match_a_b` and `match_c` are met, otherwise it will print 'NO'. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be overwritten in each iteration, and their final values will be the ones from the last iteration. The `template`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` variables will be reset and recalculated in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It then checks if the strings `a` and `b` match a specific template derived from `a` and `b`, and if `c` does not match this template. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the final values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be those from the last test case, and the `template`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` variables will be in their final state from the last iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - The program constructs a template `template` by iterating through each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the lowercase character to the template.
   - If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a` to the template.

3. **Matching Conditions:**
   - The program checks if strings `a` and `b` match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - The program checks if string `c` does not match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is not the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is not the same as the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Output:**
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Template Construction:**
  - The template construction logic is correct. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template should have the same lowercase character. If they are different, the template should have an uppercase character to ensure that both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.

- **Matching Conditions:**
  - The conditions for matching `a` and `b` with the template are correctly implemented.
  - The conditions for ensuring `c` does not match the template are also correctly implemented.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge cases where `a` and `b` are the same and where `a` and `b` are different.
  - It correctly handles the case where `c` matches the template in any position.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The reasoning and implementation are sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
