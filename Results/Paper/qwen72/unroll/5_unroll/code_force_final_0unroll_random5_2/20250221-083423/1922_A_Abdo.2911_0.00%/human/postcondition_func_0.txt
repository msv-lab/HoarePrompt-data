The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It then checks if the strings `a` and `b` match a specific template derived from `a` and `b`, and if `c` does not match this template. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the final values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be those from the last test case, and the `template`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` variables will be in their final state from the last iteration.
