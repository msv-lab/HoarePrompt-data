Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. After processing, it will print 'YES' if the conditions for `match_a_b` and `match_c` are met, otherwise it will print 'NO'. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be overwritten in each iteration, and their final values will be the ones from the last iteration. The `template`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` variables will be reset and recalculated in each iteration.**
