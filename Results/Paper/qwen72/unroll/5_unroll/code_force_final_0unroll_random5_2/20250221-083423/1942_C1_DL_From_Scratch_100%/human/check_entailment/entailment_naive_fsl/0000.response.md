Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie are such that the polygon can be divided into more triangles than the program calculates. Specifically, the program only considers the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and adds 1 to the count if the gap is exactly 1. However, it does not account for the possibility of forming additional triangles within larger gaps.

#### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
8 3 0
1 3 5
```

The program will output:
```
2
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
3
```

### Explanation of the Correct Output:
- Bessie has chosen vertices 1, 3, and 5.
- The gaps between the chosen vertices are:
  - From 1 to 3: 2 vertices (2)
  - From 3 to 5: 2 vertices (4)
  - From 5 to 1: 2 vertices (6, 7, 8, 1)

- The program only counts the gaps of size 1, but in this case, we can form the following triangles:
  - Triangle (1, 2, 3)
  - Triangle (3, 4, 5)
  - Triangle (5, 6, 1)

Thus, the program fails to correctly count the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake in this case.
