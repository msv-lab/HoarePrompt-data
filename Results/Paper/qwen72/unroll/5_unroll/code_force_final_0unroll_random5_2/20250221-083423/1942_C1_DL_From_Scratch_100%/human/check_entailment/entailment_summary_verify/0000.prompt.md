You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from input, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing vertices chosen by Bessie. It then calculates and prints the number of gaps of size 1 between the sorted vertices, plus `x - 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer and y = 0, and the input list of vertices is processed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie are such that the polygon can be divided into more triangles than the program calculates. Specifically, the program only considers the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and adds 1 to the count if the gap is exactly 1. However, it does not account for the possibility of forming additional triangles within larger gaps.

#### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
8 3 0
1 3 5
```

The program will output:
```
2
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
3
```

### Explanation of the Correct Output:
- Bessie has chosen vertices 1, 3, and 5.
- The gaps between the chosen vertices are:
  - From 1 to 3: 2 vertices (2)
  - From 3 to 5: 2 vertices (4)
  - From 5 to 1: 2 vertices (6, 7, 8, 1)

- The program only counts the gaps of size 1, but in this case, we can form the following triangles:
  - Triangle (1, 2, 3)
  - Triangle (3, 4, 5)
  - Triangle (5, 6, 1)

Thus, the program fails to correctly count the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake in this case.
