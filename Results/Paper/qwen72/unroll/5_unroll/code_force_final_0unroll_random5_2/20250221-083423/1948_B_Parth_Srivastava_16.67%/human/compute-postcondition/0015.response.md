The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. The length of the list `a` is `n`, where `2 <= n <= 50`, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies `0 <= a_i <= 99`.

Since the output is not specified in the provided information, I will assume that the function has some form of output based on the input list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers, where the length of the list is between 2 and 50, and each integer in the list is between 0 and 99. The function returns a value based on the elements of the list `a`, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
