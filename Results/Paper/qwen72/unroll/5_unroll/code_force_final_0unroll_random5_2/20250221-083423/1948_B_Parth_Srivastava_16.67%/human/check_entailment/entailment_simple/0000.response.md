### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - It iterates `m` times to process each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.

3. **Transformation Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array `a` and checks if the current element is greater than 10.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element:
     - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if the digit `y` is greater than or equal to the previous element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
     - If not, it appends the original element to `c`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element:
     - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If the condition is met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
     - If not, it appends the original element to `c`.
   - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

4. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - After processing all elements, the program sorts the list `c` and compares it with the original list `c`.
   - If `c` is already sorted, it appends `1` to `b` (indicating a positive result).
   - If `c` is not sorted, it appends `0` to `b` (indicating a negative result).

5. **Output:**
   - The program iterates through the list `b` and prints 'YES' for each `1` and 'NO' for each `0`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Transformation Logic:**
  - The logic for splitting elements greater than 10 and appending the digits to `c` is flawed. It does not correctly handle all cases where the element can be split and still maintain the sorted order.
  - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and `28` into `[2, 8]`, but it will not correctly handle the insertion of these digits to maintain the sorted order.

- **Incorrect Comparison:**
  - The program compares the transformed list `c` with its sorted version `d` to determine if the array can be sorted. However, this comparison does not account for the possibility of multiple operations being applied to different elements in the array.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the transformation and sorting logic for all possible cases, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**
