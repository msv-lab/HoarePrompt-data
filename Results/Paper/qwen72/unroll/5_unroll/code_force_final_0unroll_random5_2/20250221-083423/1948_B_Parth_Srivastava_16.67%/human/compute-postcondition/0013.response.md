Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `k` is an input integer, `n` is 8, `x` is 7, `y` is 6, `c` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], `d` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], `c` is not equal to `d`, `b` is a list containing [0].** 

The code snippet `b.append(0)` adds the integer 0 to the list `b`. Since `b` was not defined in the initial state, it is now a list containing a single element, 0. The other variables and their values remain unchanged.
