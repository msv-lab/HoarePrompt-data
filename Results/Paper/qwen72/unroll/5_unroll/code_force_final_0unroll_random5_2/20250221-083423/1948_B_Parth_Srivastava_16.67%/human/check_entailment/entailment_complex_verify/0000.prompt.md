You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `k` is an input integer, `n` is 8, `x` is 7, `y` is 6, `c` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `k` is an input integer, `n` is 8, `x` is 7, `y` is 6, `c` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], `d` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. If `c` is equal to `d`, `b` is a list containing [1]. If `c` is not equal to `d`, `b` is a list containing [0].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `k` and a space-separated list of integers `a` from user input. It processes the list `a` to create a new list `c` by potentially splitting each integer greater than 10 into its tens and units digits, and appending them to `c` under certain conditions. The final list `c` is then sorted and compared to the original `c`. If `c` is already sorted, the function appends `1` to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`. The function does not return any value, but modifies the list `b` to contain either `[1]` or `[0]` based on the sorted condition of `c`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly process the splitting of numbers and ensuring the array remains sorted after the operation. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
12 3 45 67 89
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
The program should be able to transform the array `[12, 3, 45, 67, 89]` into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` by applying the operation to the elements `12`, `45`, `67`, and `89`. However, the program does not correctly handle the splitting of these numbers and the resulting array is not checked for sorting correctly. The program incorrectly appends the original numbers back to the array in some cases, leading to an incorrect result.
