You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and the list `a` remain unchanged. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are populated with the cumulative minimum distances for each index in the list `a` when traversing from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively. For each query, the minimum distance between the two specified cities is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and a list of city positions `a`, then calculates two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` that store the cumulative minimum distances for each index in `a` when traversing from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively. It then reads the number of queries `m` and a list of queries, each specifying two cities. For each query, it computes and prints the minimum distance between the two specified cities using the precomputed distances in `d1` and `d2`. The function does not return any values but prints the results of the queries. The input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and the list `a` remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is a standard approach for handling multiple test cases in competitive programming.

2. **Dictionary Initialization**: The program initializes two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the minimum cost to travel from the first city to any other city and from the last city to any other city, respectively. This is a good approach to precompute and store these values for efficient query processing.

3. **Forward Traversal**:
   - The program starts from the first city and moves towards the last city, calculating the minimum cost to travel to each city.
   - It uses a variable `mini` to keep track of the minimum distance to the neighboring cities.
   - If the minimum distance is to the next city in the direction of traversal, it adds 1 coin to the cost. Otherwise, it adds the actual distance.
   - The cost is stored in `d1` for each city.

4. **Backward Traversal**:
   - The program then starts from the last city and moves towards the first city, calculating the minimum cost to travel to each city.
   - Similar to the forward traversal, it uses `mini` to find the minimum distance to the neighboring cities.
   - The cost is stored in `d2` for each city.

5. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program reads the starting and ending cities, adjusts them to 0-based indexing, and calculates the minimum cost to travel from the starting city to the ending city.
   - It considers two paths: one using the precomputed costs from `d1` and the other from `d2`.
   - It prints the minimum of the two calculated costs.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the starting city is the same as the ending city (though the problem guarantees that `x_i` and `y_i` are different).
   - It also correctly handles the case where the cities are at the boundaries of the list.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently precomputes the costs in O(n) time for each test case.
   - Each query is processed in O(1) time by using the precomputed costs.

8. **Correctness of Cost Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the cost to travel to the closest city using 1 coin.
   - It also correctly calculates the cost to travel to any other city using the actual distance.

9. **Unique Closest City Constraint**:
   - The program implicitly respects the constraint that the closest city is unique for each city by using the minimum distance to the neighboring cities.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
