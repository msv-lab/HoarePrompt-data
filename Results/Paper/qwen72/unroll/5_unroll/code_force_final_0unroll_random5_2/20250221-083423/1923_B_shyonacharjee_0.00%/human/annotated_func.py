#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, k, a, x) where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and x is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
        
        total_bullets_used = 0
        
        success = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            position, health = monsters[i]
            distance = abs(position)
            time_available = distance
            bullets_needed = health
            if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
                success = False
                break
            total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
        
        print('YES' if success else 'NO')
        
    #State: The variable `t` is unchanged, and the list `cases` is also unchanged. The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, the loop reads the values of `n` and `k`, the list `healths`, and the list `positions`. It then sorts the monsters based on their absolute positions and determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters within the given constraints. The result for each test case is printed as 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated, or 'NO' otherwise. The variables `total_bullets_used` and `success` are reset for each test case, and their final values are not retained after the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads `t` test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of `n` and `k` integers, followed by two lists: `healths` and `positions`. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters by sorting them based on their absolute positions and checking if the total number of bullets needed to defeat them does not exceed the time available, which is the distance of the monster from the origin. The function prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated within the constraints, or 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The variables `t` and `cases` (if present) are not modified by the function.
