Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the "Permutation game" problem by simulating the game for Bodya and Sasha over `k` turns. However, the program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
   - It also correctly reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Score and Maximum Value Check**:
   - The program checks if both players start at the position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only one player starts at the position with the maximum value, it prints the winner and continues to the next test case.
   - This part is logically correct because if a player starts at the maximum value, they will always have the highest score if they stay at that position.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The program simulates the game for up to `k` turns, but it has a mechanism to break early if both players have found the maximum value in `a`.
   - It keeps track of the scores for Bodya and Sasha in the lists `b` and `s`, respectively.
   - It also keeps track of whether each player has found the maximum value in `a` using the `foundb` and `founds` flags.

4. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha using the lists `preb` and `pres`.
   - It then calculates the potential final scores for each player by considering the remaining turns and the maximum value in `a`.

5. **Winner Determination**:
   - The program compares the potential final scores and prints the winner or "Draw" based on the comparison.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Early Termination**:
  - The program breaks the loop early if both players have found the maximum value in `a`. This is incorrect because the game should be simulated for exactly `k` turns, regardless of whether the maximum value has been found.
  - The correct approach would be to simulate the game for the full `k` turns and then determine the winner based on the final scores.

- **Score Calculation**:
  - The program calculates the potential final scores by adding the remaining turns multiplied by the current score. This is not the correct way to simulate the game, as the score should be accumulated based on the actual positions and movements of the players.
  - The correct approach would be to simulate the game step by step, updating the scores and positions based on the rules provided.

- **Redundant Variables**:
  - The variables `YES`, `NO`, and `alpha` are defined but not used in the program. They can be removed to clean up the code.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
