The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving a game between Bodya and Sasha. It takes inputs for the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, the permutation, and an array of values. For each test case, it determines the winner of the game based on the maximum values in the array and the movement of Bodya and Sasha according to the permutation. The function prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' for each test case, indicating the winner or if the game ends in a draw. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.
