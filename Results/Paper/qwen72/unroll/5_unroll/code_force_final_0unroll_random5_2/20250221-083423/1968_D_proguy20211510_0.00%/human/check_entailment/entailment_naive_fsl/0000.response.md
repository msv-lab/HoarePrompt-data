Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that once a player reaches a position with the maximum value in array `a`, they will stay there for the remaining turns. This is not necessarily true because the player can choose to stay or move to `p_x`.

Here is a counterexample that demonstrates the incorrect behavior:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
- **Initial Positions:**
  - Bodya starts at position 3 (`p_3 = 2`, `a_3 = 5`).
  - Sasha starts at position 2 (`p_2 = 1`, `a_2 = 2`).

- **Turn 1:**
  - Bodya's score: `0 + a_3 = 5`.
  - Bodya moves to `p_3 = 2`.
  - Sasha's score: `0 + a_2 = 2`.
  - Sasha moves to `p_2 = 1`.

- **Turn 2:**
  - Bodya's score: `5 + a_2 = 5 + 2 = 7`.
  - Bodya stays at position 2.
  - Sasha's score: `2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9`.
  - Sasha stays at position 1.

- **Final Scores:**
  - Bodya: 7
  - Sasha: 9

The program incorrectly outputs "Draw" because it assumes that once a player reaches a position with the maximum value in `a`, they will stay there. However, in this example, Bodya and Sasha do not necessarily stay at the position with the maximum value in `a` for the entire game. Therefore, the program does not correctly simulate the game as described.
