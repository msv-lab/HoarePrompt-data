You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` takes two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, both of which are lists of tuples containing two integers. It calculates the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` and adds to this sum the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of these elements is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns this final sum, leaving `main_ar` and `sec_arr` unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to handle input. `func_1` reads a single integer, and `func_2` reads a list of integers. These functions are used to read the number of test cases, the values of `n` and `k`, and the lists of prices `a` and `b`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is encapsulated in the `func_3` function. This function takes two lists, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, and calculates Alice's profit.
   - `sec_arr` is assumed to be the list of items that Bob will take for free, and `main_ar` is the list of items that Alice will buy and potentially sell to Bob.
   - The function initializes `sub_summ` to 0, which will store the total profit.
   - It then iterates over `sec_arr` and adds the `a_i` values to `sub_summ`. This represents the cost Alice incurs for the items Bob takes for free.
   - Next, it iterates over `main_ar` and adds the profit `b_i - a_i` to `sub_summ` for each item where `b_i - a_i` is non-negative. This ensures that Alice only considers items that will contribute positively to her profit.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should buy items that maximize her profit, which is `b_i - a_i`.
   - Bob will take the `k` items with the highest `b_i - a_i` values for free to minimize Alice's profit.
   - The program should sort the items based on `b_i - a_i` in descending order and then consider the first `k` items for Bob to take for free. The remaining items should be added to Alice's profit if `b_i - a_i` is non-negative.

4. **Implementation**:
   - The program does not explicitly sort the items based on `b_i - a_i` or handle the `k` items that Bob will take for free. This is a critical missing step.
   - The function `func_3` assumes that `sec_arr` and `main_ar` are already sorted or pre-processed, but there is no evidence of such preprocessing in the provided code.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case, Alice should buy the 2nd item (profit = 2 - 1 = 1). The program should correctly output 1.
   - For the second test case, Alice should buy the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd items. Bob will take the 1st item for free (profit = (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1). The program should correctly output 1.
   - For the third test case, Alice should buy the 1st and 2nd items. Bob will take the 2nd item for free (profit = 4 - (2+1) = 1). The program should output 0, but it does not handle this correctly.
   - For the fourth test case, Alice should buy the 4th, 5th, and 6th items. Bob will take the 4th and 5th items for free (profit = (10+6) - (9+1+3) = 7). The program should correctly output 7.

### Conclusion:
The program is missing the critical step of sorting the items based on `b_i - a_i` and handling the `k` items that Bob will take for free. Without this, the program cannot correctly determine the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.
