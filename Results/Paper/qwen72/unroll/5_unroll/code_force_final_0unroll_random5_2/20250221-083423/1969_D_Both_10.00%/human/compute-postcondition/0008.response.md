The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`. Both `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The integers in the tuples of `main_ar` represent price differences for items, and the integers in the tuples of `sec_arr` represent prices for items.

The function returns the value of `sub_summ`, which is calculated as follows:
- It sums the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.
- It also sums the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the first and second elements is greater than or equal to 0.
- The final return value is the sum of these two quantities.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, both of which are lists of tuples containing two integers. It returns the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the first and second elements is greater than or equal to 0.**
