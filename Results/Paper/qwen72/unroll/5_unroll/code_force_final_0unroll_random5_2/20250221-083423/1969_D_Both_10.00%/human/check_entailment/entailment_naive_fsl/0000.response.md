Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate Alice's profit based on the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not handle the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
2 1 1 1
4 2 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will not produce the correct output because it does not correctly calculate the profit by considering the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Alice can buy all 4 items, spending a total of \(2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\).
- Bob will take the 2 most expensive items for free, which are the items with prices \(4\) and \(3\) for Bob.
- Bob will pay for the remaining 2 items, which have prices \(2\) and \(2\) for Bob.
- Alice's profit is calculated as follows:
  - Bob pays \(2 + 2 = 4\).
  - Alice's total cost is \(5\).
  - Alice's profit is \(4 - 5 = -1\).

However, the optimal strategy for Alice is to buy only the items that maximize her profit, which in this case is to buy the items with prices \(1, 1, 1\) for Alice and \(2, 3, 2\) for Bob. Bob will take the 2 most expensive items for free, which are \(3\) and \(2\), and pay for the remaining item, which is \(2\). Alice's profit is \(2 - (1 + 1 + 1) = 0\).

The provided program does not correctly handle this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.
