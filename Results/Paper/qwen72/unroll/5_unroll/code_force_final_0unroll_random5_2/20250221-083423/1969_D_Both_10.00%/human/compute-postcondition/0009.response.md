Functionality: ** The function `func_3` takes two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, both of which are lists of tuples containing two integers. It calculates the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` and adds to this sum the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of these elements is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns this final sum, leaving `main_ar` and `sec_arr` unchanged. **
