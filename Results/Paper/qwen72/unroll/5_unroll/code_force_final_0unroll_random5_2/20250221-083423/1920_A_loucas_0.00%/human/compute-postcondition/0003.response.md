The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function processes a series of test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` constraints, where each constraint is represented by two integers `a` and `x`. The integer `a` is in the set {1, 2, 3}, and `1 <= x <= 10^9`. The function must handle `t` test cases, where `1 <= t <= 500`, and each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, with no two constraints being the same.

The function returns the result of processing each test case, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` constraints. Each constraint is represented by two integers `a` and `x`, where `a` is in {1, 2, 3} and `1 <= x <= 10^9`. The function returns the result of processing each test case, ensuring that each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, with no two constraints being the same.**
