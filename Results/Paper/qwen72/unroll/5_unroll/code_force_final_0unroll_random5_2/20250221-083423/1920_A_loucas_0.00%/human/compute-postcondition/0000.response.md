Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each of the n lines contains two integers a and x, where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, representing the type of constraint and the value x, respectively. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the exact same. `loop` is an input integer.**
