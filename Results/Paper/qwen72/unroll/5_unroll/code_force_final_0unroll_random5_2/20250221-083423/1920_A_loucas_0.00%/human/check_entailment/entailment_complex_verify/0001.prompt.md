You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each of the n lines contains two integers a and x, where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, representing the type of constraint and the value x, respectively. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the exact same.

    #State: The loop will execute `loop` times, and for each iteration, it will read `innerLoop` lines of input, process the constraints, and print a number `num` that satisfies the constraints (if such a number exists). The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` constraints. Each constraint is represented by two integers `a` and `x`, where `a` is in {1, 2, 3} and `1 <= x <= 10^9`. For each test case, the function reads the constraints, categorizes them into three lists (`big`, `less`, `no`), and then finds the smallest integer `num` that is greater than all values in `big`, less than all values in `less`, and not in `no`. If such an integer exists, it prints `num`; otherwise, it prints `0`. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `x` are not modified by the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
**Reasoning:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`loop`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`innerLoop`).

2. **Constraint Collection:**
   - The program collects constraints into three lists: `big` for "k must be greater than or equal to x", `less` for "k must be less than or equal to x", and `no` for "k must not be equal to x".
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the range of valid `k` values by finding the maximum of the `big` list and the minimum of the `less` list.
   - This is correct because `k` must be in the range `[max(big), min(less)]`.

4. **Counting Valid `k` Values:**
   - The program iterates over the range `[max(big), min(less))` and checks if each value is not in the `no` list.
   - However, the program only sets `num` to the first valid `k` value it finds and then breaks out of the loop.
   - This is incorrect because the problem requires the number of valid `k` values, not just the first one.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints `num`, which is the first valid `k` value found, instead of the count of valid `k` values.

**Correctness:**
- The program is incorrect because it does not count the number of valid `k` values as required by the problem. Instead, it prints the first valid `k` value it finds.

**Correctness: False**
