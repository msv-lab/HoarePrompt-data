To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range` function and will start at 0 by default.
2. **Input Value**: The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples `test_cases` where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) and a string `s` (s_i ∈ {'+', '-'} and |s| = n).

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Since the loop is controlled by the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
