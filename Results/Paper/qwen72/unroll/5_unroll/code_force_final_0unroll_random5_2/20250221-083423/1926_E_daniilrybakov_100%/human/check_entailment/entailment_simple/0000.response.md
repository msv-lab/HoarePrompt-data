### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order: first all odd-numbered cards, then all cards that are twice an odd number, then all cards that are three times an odd number, and so on.
   - The goal is to determine the k-th card laid down in this process.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `s` (a counter for the total number of cards laid down so far) and `m` (a multiplier to determine the current group of cards being laid down).
   - It enters a loop where it calculates `x`, the number of cards in the current group (i.e., cards that are `m` times an odd number).
   - It updates `n` to the number of remaining cards after laying down the current group.
   - If `k` falls within the current group (i.e., `s < k <= s + x`), the loop breaks.
   - The program then prints the k-th card in the current group, calculated as `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `s` starts at 0, and `m` starts at 1, which is correct for the first group of odd-numbered cards.
   - **Loop:**
     - The loop continues until `n` becomes 0, which ensures that all cards are considered.
     - `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which correctly gives the number of cards in the current group.
     - `n` is updated to `n // 2`, which correctly reduces the number of remaining cards.
     - The condition `if s < k and k <= s + x` checks if the k-th card is in the current group. If so, the loop breaks.
   - **Output:**
     - The k-th card in the current group is calculated as `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`, which is correct. This formula ensures that the cards are laid down in the correct order within the group.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly, as it will output 1 (the only card).
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` correctly, as it will output the last card in the sequence.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 1`, the output is `1` (correct).
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the output is `3` (correct).
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the output is `5` (correct).
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 4`, the output is `7` (correct).
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 5`, the output is `2` (correct).
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 6`, the output is `6` (correct).
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 7`, the output is `4` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. It handles all edge cases and the provided examples correctly.

Correctness: **True**
