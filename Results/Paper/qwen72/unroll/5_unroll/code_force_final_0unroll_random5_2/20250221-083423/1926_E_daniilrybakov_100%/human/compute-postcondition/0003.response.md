The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within the function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^9`. The function is expected to return a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Given the constraints, the function likely processes these test cases and returns a result that is dependent on the values of `n` and `k` for each case. Since the exact output is not specified, we can only infer that the function returns some value or values based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^9`, and returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
