For the loop to execute, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_` and `t`. The loop depends on the value of `t` to determine how many times it will run. Since `t` is the integer value input by the user, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted as it is used to indicate that the loop variable is not actually used within the loop body.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable**
