Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself. This part of the program is accurate.

2. **Splitting the String**: The program splits the string `s` by the character `-`. This step is intended to isolate segments of `+` characters, but it does not fully achieve the intended purpose because it does not consider the penalties of the `-` segments. However, this step is not necessary for the correct solution, as the optimal penalty can be calculated without explicitly splitting the string.

3. **Calculating the Penalty**: The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the penalty. The logic in `func_1` is as follows:
   - It initializes `count` and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates over each character in the string `expression`.
   - For each `+` character, it increments the `balance` by 1.
   - For each `-` character, it decrements the `balance` by 1.
   - If the `balance` becomes negative, it increments the `count` by 1 and resets the `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

4. **Flaw in Logic**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the splitting of the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
   - The `balance` variable is used to track the cumulative sum of the array, but the logic for splitting and calculating the penalty is incorrect.
   - The program only counts the number of times the `balance` becomes negative and adds 1 if the final `balance` is positive. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To minimize the penalty, the optimal strategy is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of 0 if possible. This ensures that the penalty for each subarray is 0.
   - If it is not possible to split the array into subarrays with a sum of 0, the next best strategy is to split the array into subarrays with the smallest possible non-zero sum.
   - The correct approach involves keeping track of the cumulative sum and finding the minimum penalty by ensuring that the sum of each subarray is as close to 0 as possible.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `+`, the correct output is 1, which the program produces.
   - For the input `-----`, the correct output is 5, which the program produces.
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the correct output is 0, but the program does not produce this because it does not correctly handle the splitting of the array.
   - For the input `--+++++++`, the correct output is 4, but the program does not produce this because it does not correctly handle the splitting of the array.
   - For the input `+---++++-+++++---++-`, the correct output is 4, but the program does not produce this because it does not correctly handle the splitting of the array.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not consider the optimal way to split the array.

Final: **False**
