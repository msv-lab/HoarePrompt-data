Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the minimum possible penalty for splitting a string `s` of "+" and "-" characters into subarrays, where each subarray's penalty is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to minimize this total penalty.

The provided program, however, does not correctly implement the logic to achieve this goal. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Use of `split('-')`**: The program splits the string `expression` by "-" characters, which is not a valid approach for this problem. The split operation is used to divide the string into parts, but it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. Instead, it only counts the number of segments separated by "-" and sums their lengths, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the penalty based on the number of times the balance goes below zero and whether the final balance is positive. This does not align with the problem's definition of penalty, which is the sum of the absolute values of the subarray sums multiplied by their lengths.

3. **Optimal Splitting Strategy**: The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to ensure that each subarray has a sum of zero if possible. If the sum of the entire array is zero, the penalty can be zero. If the sum is non-zero, the penalty should be minimized by splitting the array in a way that balances the sums of the subarrays as much as possible.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
