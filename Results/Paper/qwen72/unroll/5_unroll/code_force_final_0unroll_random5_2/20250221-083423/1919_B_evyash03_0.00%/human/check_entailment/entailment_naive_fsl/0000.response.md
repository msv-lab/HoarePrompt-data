Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum penalty, but it does not follow the correct approach to split the array and calculate the penalties.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of the Case:**
- The string `s = "+-+-+-"` can be split into subarrays such that the sum of penalties is minimized.
- One optimal way to split `s` is `(["+-", "+-", "+-"])`.
- The penalty for each subarray is:
  - `p(["+-"]) = |1 - 1| * 2 = 0`
  - `p(["+-"]) = |1 - 1| * 2 = 0`
  - `p(["+-"]) = |1 - 1| * 2 = 0`
- The total penalty is `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.

However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly. It splits the string based on the balance of `+` and `-` characters, which does not always result in the minimum penalty. In this case, it incorrectly calculates the penalty as `3` instead of `0`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
