Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`.** 

The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to 0 and `n` respectively. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and `pos` retains its value based on the initial condition.
