Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges. The logic in the program is based on the following observations:

1. **If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`:**  
   - In this case, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate Everule on island 1. Since there are `n - 1` bridges connecting island 1 to the other `n - 1` islands, if `k` is at least `n - 1`, Dominater can destroy all these bridges. This means Everule can only visit island 1, so the output is `1`.

2. **If `k` is less than `n - 1`:**  
   - In this case, Dominater cannot destroy enough bridges to isolate Everule on island 1. Even if Dominater destroys `k` bridges, there will still be at least one bridge connecting island 1 to another island, allowing Everule to visit all `n` islands. Therefore, the output is `n`.

The program correctly implements this logic. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, then prints the appropriate result based on the conditions described above.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing each test case and printing the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
