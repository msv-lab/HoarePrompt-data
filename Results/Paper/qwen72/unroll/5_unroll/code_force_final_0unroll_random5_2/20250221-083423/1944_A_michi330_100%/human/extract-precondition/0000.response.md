The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the number of islands and the number of bridges that can be destroyed. Here's the correct function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def min_islands(n, k):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and k is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.**
