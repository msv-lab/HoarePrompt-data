### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves simulating a game of Quidditch where players from two teams (Red and Blue) move around a field to score goals using a Quaffle.
   - The field also contains goals, a Bludger, and the Quaffle.
   - Players can move, catch the Quaffle, and throw the Quaffle.
   - If a player is on the same cell as a Bludger, they are eliminated.
   - Scoring a goal in the opponent's goal gives a point to the player's team.
   - Scoring a goal in the player's own goal gives a point to the opponent's team.
   - The Quaffle returns to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The output should include the main events (goals and eliminations) and the final score.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function updates the position of an object (player or ball) based on the direction (`d`).
     - It correctly handles the movement in the four directions (U, D, L, R).
     - The function modifies the object's position in place, which is appropriate for the simulation.
     - **Annotation Verification:**
       - The annotations correctly describe the state before and after the function call.
       - The function ensures that the entity moves within the bounds of the field, although this is not explicitly checked in the function itself (assumed valid input).

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
     - It correctly appends the player to the `out` list if they are on the same cell as the Bludger.
     - It then sets the player's position to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are eliminated.
     - The function sorts the `out` list and prints the elimination events in alphabetical order, which is correct according to the problem statement.
     - **Annotation Verification:**
       - The annotations correctly describe the state before and after the function call.
       - The function ensures that the elimination events are printed in the correct order.

3. **Main Logic of the Program:**
   - The main logic of the program is provided in the loop that processes each step of the game.
   - **Initialization:**
     - The program correctly initializes the field, goals, players, and the positions of the Quaffle and Bludger.
   - **Game Simulation:**
     - The program iterates through each step of the game.
     - For each step, it processes the action based on the entity and the action type.
     - It correctly handles the catching and throwing of the Quaffle.
     - It correctly checks if a player is eliminated by the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
     - It correctly checks if a goal is scored and updates the score accordingly.
     - It correctly resets the position of the Quaffle to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
   - **Output:**
     - The program prints the main events (goals and eliminations) as required.
     - It prints the final score at the end of the game.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program assumes valid inputs, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem constraints.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the entity moves outside the bounds of the field, but this is assumed to be handled by the input constraints.
   - The program does not handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, but the problem guarantees this does not happen.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program includes the necessary functions and main logic to simulate the game and produce the correct output.
   - The program correctly handles all the required aspects of the problem, including movement, catching, throwing, scoring, and elimination.
   - The annotations support the correctness of the functions and the overall logic of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct for the given problem. It correctly simulates the game, handles all the required actions, and produces the correct output as specified in the problem description.
