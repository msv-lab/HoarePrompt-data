Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incomplete and lacks several key components necessary to solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incomplete Functionality**:
   - The program only contains two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which are not sufficient to handle the entire logic of the game.
   - There is no function to handle the scoring, ball catching, or ball throwing actions.
   - There is no function to reset the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

2. **Missing Data Structures**:
   - The program does not define the necessary data structures to store the positions of the players, goals, Quaffle, and Bludger.
   - It does not define the initial positions of these entities based on the input.

3. **Missing Event Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the sequence of actions over the T steps.
   - It does not print the events in the required format (e.g., "t RED GOAL", "t BLUE GOAL", "t p ELIMINATED").

4. **Incorrect Function Usage**:
   - The `func_2` function is supposed to handle the elimination of players, but it is not clear how it is called or how it fits into the overall program.
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to handle the movement of entities, but it is not clear how it is used in the context of the game.

5. **Missing Final Score Output**:
   - The program does not output the final score at the end of the game.

To be considered correct, the program would need to include all the necessary functions and data structures to handle the game logic, process the actions, and output the required events and final score.
