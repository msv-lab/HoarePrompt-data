### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions (`n` and `m`), the positions of the goals (`rg` and `bg`), the Quaffle (`ball`), the Bludger (`blud`), and the players (`player`).
   - The program reads the initial state of the field and parses the entities' positions correctly.

2. **Game Loop:**
   - The program iterates through each step of the game, reading the action and the entity performing it.
   - The actions are handled correctly:
     - **Catching the Quaffle (`C`):** The program updates the `carry` variable to indicate which player is carrying the Quaffle.
     - **Throwing the Quaffle (`T`):** The program checks if the Quaffle is in a goal and updates the score accordingly. It also resets the `carry` variable and moves the Quaffle to the middle of the field.
     - **Moving Entities (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`):** The program calls `func_1` to update the position of the entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the direction. It then calls `func_2` to check for player eliminations if the entity is a player or the Bludger.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly updates the position of the entity based on the direction.
   - It handles all four directions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`) and updates the coordinates accordingly.
   - The function assumes that the move will not result in the entity moving outside the bounds of the field, which is a valid assumption given the problem constraints.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function checks if any player's position matches the Bludger's position.
   - If a match is found, the player is marked as eliminated by setting their position to `[-1, -1]`.
   - The function prints the elimination events in the correct format and order.
   - The function does not return any value but updates the `player` dictionary and prints the necessary messages.

5. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all the steps, the program prints the final score in the correct format.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle all the specified actions and conditions as described in the problem statement. It initializes the field and entities, processes the game steps, updates the positions, handles scoring and eliminations, and prints the final score. There are no apparent logical errors or issues with the implementation.

**Correctness: True**
