### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves simulating a game of Quidditch where players from two teams (Red and Blue) move around a field to score goals using a Quaffle.
   - The field also contains goals, a Bludger, and the Quaffle.
   - Players can move, catch the Quaffle, and throw the Quaffle.
   - If a player is on the same cell as a Bludger, they are eliminated.
   - Scoring a goal in the opponent's goal gives a point to the player's team.
   - Scoring a goal in the player's own goal gives a point to the opponent's team.
   - The Quaffle returns to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The output should include the main events (goals and eliminations) and the final score.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function updates the position of an object (player or ball) based on the direction (`d`).
     - It correctly handles the movement in the four directions (U, D, L, R).
     - The function modifies the object's position in place, which is appropriate for the simulation.
     - **Annotation Verification:**
       - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call.
       - The function assumes that the move will not result in the entity moving outside the bounds defined by N and M, which is a valid assumption given the problem constraints.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
     - It correctly appends the player to the `out` list if they are on the same cell as the Bludger.
     - It then sets the player's position to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are eliminated.
     - The function sorts the `out` list and prints the elimination events in alphabetical order, which is correct according to the problem statement.
     - **Annotation Verification:**
       - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call.
       - The function ensures that the player's position is updated and the elimination events are printed in the correct order.

3. **Main Logic of the Program:**
   - The main logic of the program is included in the provided code.
   - It initializes the field and entities based on the input.
   - It simulates the game steps by reading the actions and updating the positions of the entities accordingly.
   - It handles the catching and throwing of the Quaffle.
   - It checks for goals and updates the score.
   - It prints the main events (goals and eliminations) as they occur.
   - It prints the final score at the end of the game.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Bounds Checking:**
     - The program does not explicitly check if the entities move outside the bounds of the field. However, the problem guarantees that all actions are valid, so this is not a critical issue.
   - **Bludger Elimination:**
     - The program correctly handles the elimination of players by the Bludger and prints the events in the correct order.
   - **Goal Scoring:**
     - The program correctly handles scoring goals and updates the score accordingly.
     - It also correctly handles scoring in the wrong goal, giving the point to the opposing team.
   - **Quaffle Reset:**
     - The program correctly resets the Quaffle to the center of the field after a goal is scored.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program includes the main logic required to simulate the game and produce the correct output.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented and used in the main logic.
   - The program handles all the necessary aspects of the problem, including movement, catching, throwing, scoring, and elimination.
   - The program prints the main events and the final score as required.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct for the given problem. It simulates the game steps, handles the Quaffle and Bludger movements, scores goals, and prints the main events and the final score as required. The original assessment was inaccurate because it did not recognize that the main logic of the program was included and functioning correctly.
