You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer representing the current time step in the game, and `player` and `blud` are dictionaries where the keys are strings representing player identifiers (e.g., 'R0', 'B1') and the values are lists of integers representing the current position of the player or the Bludger on the field. The positions are valid and within the bounds of the field.
def func_2(t):
    out = []
    for p in player:
        if player[p] == blud:
            out.append(p)
            player[p] = [-1, -1]
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `player` has the positions of any players that matched the Bludger's position updated to `[-1, -1]`, and `out` contains the identifiers of those players.
    for p in sorted(out):
        print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
        
    #State: The loop prints the value of `t` and each player identifier in `out` in ascending order, followed by 'ELIMINATED'. The variables `t`, `player`, and `out` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-negative integer `t` and two dictionaries `player` and `blud`. If `t` is 0, it returns a message indicating the start of the game. If `t` is greater than 0, it returns the current positions of the players and Bludgers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
