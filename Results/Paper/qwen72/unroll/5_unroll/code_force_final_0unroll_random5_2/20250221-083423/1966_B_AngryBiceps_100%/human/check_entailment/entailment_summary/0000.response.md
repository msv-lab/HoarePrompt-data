Reasoning:  
The program is designed to determine if it is possible to make all squares in an n \times m grid the same color using the specified operations. The key insight here is that the operations can only change the color of a subrectangle if the selected squares are of the same color. Therefore, the program needs to check if there is a way to ensure that all squares can eventually be the same color.

The program checks two specific conditions:
1. If the first row and the last row are both monochromatic (i.e., contain only one unique character) but are different from each other, it prints 'NO'.
2. If the first column and the last column are both monochromatic but are different from each other, it prints 'NO'.

If neither of these conditions is met, the program prints 'YES'.

However, these conditions are not sufficient to determine the correctness of the solution. The program should also consider the following:
- If the entire grid is already monochromatic, it should print 'YES'.
- If there is any row or column that is not monochromatic but can be made monochromatic through a series of operations, it should print 'YES'.

The current program does not account for the possibility of making the entire grid monochromatic through operations that involve non-edge rows or columns. For example, a grid like this:
```
BWBW
WBWB
BWBW
```
is possible to make monochromatic by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners, but the program would incorrectly print 'NO' because the first and last rows are different.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases where the grid can be made monochromatic.

Correctness: **False**
