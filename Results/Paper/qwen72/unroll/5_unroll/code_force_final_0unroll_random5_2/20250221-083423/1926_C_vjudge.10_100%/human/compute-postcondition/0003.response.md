The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `inf`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1` and `inf`. The loop will execute if `inf` is greater than `1`. The variable `i` will start at `1` as specified by the range.

Since `inf` is defined as `200001`, which is greater than `1`, the loop will execute. However, to clearly state the conditions for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `inf` is greater than `1` and `i` starts at `1`.

State: **`t` is the input integer provided by the user, `inf` is 200001 (which must be greater than 1), `i` is 1, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros**
