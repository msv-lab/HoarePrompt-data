- The program correctly precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all integers from 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\).
  - For each test case, it correctly retrieves and prints the precomputed sum for the given `value`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements. It efficiently handles the constraints and produces the correct output for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness:
