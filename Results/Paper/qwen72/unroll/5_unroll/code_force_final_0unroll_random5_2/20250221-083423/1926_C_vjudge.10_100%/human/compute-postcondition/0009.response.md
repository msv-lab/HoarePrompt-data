Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and prints the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the list `values` contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 200000. **
