Output State: **The value of `t` remains unchanged as the input integer provided by the user, `inf` remains 200001, and `values` remains the same list where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) is the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` added to the previous element in the list. The loop prints the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to the user-provided `value` for each iteration, but does not modify any of the variables in the loop head or body.**
