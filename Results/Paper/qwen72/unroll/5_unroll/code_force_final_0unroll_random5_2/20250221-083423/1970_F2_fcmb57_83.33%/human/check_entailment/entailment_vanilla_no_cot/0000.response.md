Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the game logic as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Movement Function**:
   - The `func_1` function is defined to move an entity, but it incorrectly swaps the x and y coordinates when performing the movement. The correct implementation should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(a, b):
         (x, y) = a
         (dx, dy) = b
         return (x + dx, y + dy)
     ```
   - However, the problem statement specifies that the movement directions are:
     - 'U' (up) should move the entity to the cell above (decrease y by 1).
     - 'D' (down) should move the entity to the cell below (increase y by 1).
     - 'L' (left) should move the entity to the cell to the left (decrease x by 1).
     - 'R' (right) should move the entity to the cell to the right (increase x by 1).
   - The `mouvements` dictionary should be:
     ```python
     mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
     ```

2. **Incorrect Handling of Ball Catching**:
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is a comparison, not an assignment. It should be:
     ```python
     quidditch[1] = mo[0]
     ```

3. **Incorrect Handling of Scoring**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. The logic should check if the player is from the same team as the goal and then award the point to the opposing team.
   - The program also does not correctly reset the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Bludger Elimination**:
   - The program incorrectly checks for the presence of a Bludger in the `players` dictionary using `'.B' in players`. The Bludger is not a player and should be handled separately.
   - The program does not correctly handle the elimination of players when they move into the same cell as the Bludger.

5. **Incorrect Final Score Output**:
   - The final score output should be `FINAL SCORE: r b`, but the program prints `FINAL SCORE: pointsr pointsb`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)

# Initialize the field
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

# Initialize the Bludger position
bludger = None
for k, v in players.items():
    if k == '.B':
        bludger = v
        del players[k]
        break

# Process the moves
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    entity = mo[0]
    action = mo[1]
    
    if action in 'ULDR':
        # Move the entity
        new_pos = func_1(players[entity], mouvements[action])
        players[entity] = new_pos
        
        # Check for Bludger elimination
        if bludger and new_pos == bludger:
            print(i, entity, 'ELIMINATED')
            if quidditch[1] == entity:
                quidditch = [new_pos, '']
            del players[entity]
    
    elif action == 'C':
        # Catch the Quaffle
        quidditch[1] = entity
    
    elif action == 'T':
        # Throw the Quaffle
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if new_pos in goals['R']:
            if entity[0] == 'B':
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            else:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
        
        if new_pos in goals['B']:
            if entity[0] == 'R':
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            else:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle

# Output the final score
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

This corrected program should now handle the game logic as specified in the problem statement.
