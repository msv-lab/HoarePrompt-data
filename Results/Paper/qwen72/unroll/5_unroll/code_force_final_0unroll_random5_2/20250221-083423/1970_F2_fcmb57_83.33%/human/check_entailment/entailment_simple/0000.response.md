Reasoning:  
The program provided has some issues that need to be addressed to ensure it functions correctly according to the problem description:

1. **Function `func_1` Error**: The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the movement of players. However, the function is incorrectly defined. The parameters `a` and `b` are expected to be a tuple representing the player's current position and a tuple representing the movement direction, respectively. The function incorrectly attempts to unpack `b` (which is a tuple) directly into `dx` and `dy`. This will cause a `TypeError` because `b` is a tuple, not a dictionary or list. The correct implementation should be:
   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       x, y = a
       dx, dy = b
       return (x + dx, y + dy)
   ```

2. **Handling the Quidditch Ball**: The program uses a list `quidditch` to track the position of the Quaffle and the player carrying it. However, the assignment `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` in the `C` (catch) action is incorrect. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to assign the player who catches the Quaffle.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is flawed. The program checks if the player's position is in the goals list and then increments the score. However, it should also handle the case where a player scores in the wrong goal, which awards a point to the opposing team. The current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario.

4. **Bludger Elimination**: The program correctly handles the elimination of players when they come into contact with the Bludger. However, the logic for checking if the player is carrying the Quaffle and what happens to the Quaffle after the player is eliminated is not fully implemented. The Quaffle should remain on the cell where the player was eliminated.

5. **Final Score Output**: The final score output is correct, but the program should ensure that all events are printed in the correct order and format.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
