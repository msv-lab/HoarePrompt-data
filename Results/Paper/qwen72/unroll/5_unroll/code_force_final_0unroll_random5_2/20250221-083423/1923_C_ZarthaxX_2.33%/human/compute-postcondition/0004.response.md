The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1)` will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer read from input, and `i` is not yet defined. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start at 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
