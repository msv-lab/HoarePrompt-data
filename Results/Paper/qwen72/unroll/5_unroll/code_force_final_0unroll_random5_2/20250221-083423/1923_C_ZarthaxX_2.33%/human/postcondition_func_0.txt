The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an array `nums`. It accepts no parameters directly but reads input from standard input. The input consists of the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`, followed by the array `nums` itself. For each query, represented by a pair of integers `(l, r)`, the function determines if the subarray `nums[l-1:r]` can be transformed into a subarray where all elements are 1 by performing a specific operation. The operation involves changing each element to 1 and checking if the total number of changes required is less than or equal to the sum of the differences between each element and 1 in the subarray. The function prints 'YES' if the condition is met for the query, otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries, the function terminates without returning any value, and the state of the `ones` and `sum` lists remains unchanged.
