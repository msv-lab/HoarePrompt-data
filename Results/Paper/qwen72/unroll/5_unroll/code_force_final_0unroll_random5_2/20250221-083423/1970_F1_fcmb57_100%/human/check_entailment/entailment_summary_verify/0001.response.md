### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`).
   - It initializes a dictionary `players` to store the positions of the players and a dictionary `goals` to store the positions of the goals for each team.
   - It correctly parses the field and populates the `players` and `goals` dictionaries.

2. **Movement Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of moves (`moves`) and then processes each move.
   - For each move, it checks if the action is a movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`) or a throw (`T`).

3. **Movement Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle the movement of players. It takes the current position and a direction, and returns the new position.
   - The movement is correctly calculated by adding the direction vector to the current position.
   - However, the function summary provided states that `func_1` raises a `TypeError` because it attempts to unpack an integer `b` into `dx` and `dy`. This is incorrect. The function `func_1` actually takes a tuple `b` which is correctly unpacked into `dx` and `dy`.

4. **Scoring Logic:**
   - When a player throws the Quaffle (`T`), the program checks if the player is at a goal position.
   - If the player is at a goal of the opposite team, the correct team scores a point and the event is printed.
   - If the player is at a goal of their own team, the opposite team scores a point and the event is printed.
   - The program correctly handles the scoring logic as described in the problem statement.

5. **Final Score Output:**
   - After processing all the moves, the program prints the final score.
   - The output format for the events and the final score is correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Issues:
- **Quaffle Position:**
  - The program does not explicitly track the position of the Quaffle. Instead, it assumes that the Quaffle is always carried by a player or at a goal. This is a valid assumption given the problem constraints.
- **Quaffle Reset:**
  - The program does not reset the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored. However, since the problem guarantees that the Quaffle is always at a valid position and the next action will be valid, this is not an issue.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the input, process the moves, and output the events and final score as required by the problem statement. Given the constraints and the guarantees provided, the program is correct. The function summary provided is inaccurate, as `func_1` does not raise a `TypeError` and functions as intended.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
