Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical error that affects its correctness. The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the movement of players, but it incorrectly unpacks the movement direction `b` as if it were a tuple, which it is not. The `mouvements` dictionary correctly maps the movement directions to tuples, but `func_1` is called with `mouvements[mo[1]]`, which is a tuple. However, the function itself is defined to unpack `b` directly, which will raise a `TypeError` because `b` is expected to be a tuple but is treated as an integer.

Additionally, the program does not handle the movement of the Quaffle when it is thrown and does not reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored. This is a critical part of the game mechanics as described in the problem statement.

Finally, the program does not check if a player is carrying the Quaffle before attempting to score, which could lead to incorrect scoring if a player is at a goal but not carrying the Quaffle.

Correctness: **False**

The program will not run correctly due to the `TypeError` in `func_1`, and it does not fully implement the game rules as specified, particularly the handling of the Quaffle and the scoring mechanism.
