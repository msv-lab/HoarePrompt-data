You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. Each `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: `prefix` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
    print(arr, prefix)

    #State: Output State: `prefix` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged. `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[1, 0]`. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`.

    #State: `prefix` remains unchanged. `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `[j][0]` contains the count of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0, and each sublist `[j][1]` contains the count of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1.

    #State: Output State: `prefix` remains unchanged, `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `[j][0]` contains 0 and each sublist `[j][1]` contains 0, `ans` is the sum of the products of the counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0 and the initial counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0, plus the counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1 and the initial counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1, for all j from 0 to 31.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the products of the counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0 and the initial counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0, plus the counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1 and the initial counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1, for all j from 0 to 31)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns a list of results, where each result is based on the processing of the integers in each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
