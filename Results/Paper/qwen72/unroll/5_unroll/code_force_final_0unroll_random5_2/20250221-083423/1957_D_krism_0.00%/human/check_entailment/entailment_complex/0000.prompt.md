Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

# Annotated Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. Each `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: `prefix` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
    print(arr, prefix)
    #This is printed: [arr, prefix] (where arr is a list of integers and prefix is a list of integers with length n + 1, starting with 0 and each subsequent element being the cumulative XOR of the elements in arr up to that point)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]

    #State: Output State: `prefix` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged. `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[1, 0]`. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`.

    #State: `prefix` remains unchanged. `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `[j][0]` contains the count of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0, and each sublist `[j][1]` contains the count of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1.

    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        
        k = y.bit_length() - 1

                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `prefix` remains unchanged, `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `[j][0]` contains 0 and each sublist `[j][1]` contains 0, `ans` is the sum of the products of the counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0 and the initial counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0, plus the counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1 and the initial counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1, for all j from 0 to 31.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the products of the counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0 and the initial counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 0, plus the counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1 and the initial counts of elements in `prefix[1:n+1]` that have the j-th bit set to 1, for all j from 0 to 31)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the user. It computes the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr`, starting with 0, and stores these values in a list `prefix` of length `n + 1`. It then calculates the number of elements in `prefix` that have each bit (from 0 to 31) set to 0 and 1, updating two lists `pre` and `suf` accordingly. Finally, it computes a result `ans` based on the counts in `pre` and `suf` and prints `ans`. The function does not return any value. The variables `t` and `test_cases` mentioned in the comments are not used in the function.
