To determine what will be printed by the `print(arr, prefix)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`arr`**: This is a list of integers. The exact values of the elements in `arr` are not specified in the initial state, so we can only refer to it as a list of integers.

2. **`prefix`**: This is a list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.

   - The first element of `prefix` is 0.
   - The second element of `prefix` is the XOR of the first element of `arr`.
   - The third element of `prefix` is the XOR of the first two elements of `arr`.
   - This pattern continues until the last element of `prefix`, which is the XOR of all elements in `arr`.

Given this information, let's describe the output:

- `arr` will be printed as a list of integers.
- `prefix` will be printed as a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with 0.

Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we can only describe the structure and the relationship between `arr` and `prefix`.

Output: **[arr, prefix] (where arr is a list of integers and prefix is a list of integers with length n + 1, starting with 0 and each subsequent element being the cumulative XOR of the elements in arr up to that point)**
