You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. Each `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ n and f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z). The program seems to be attempting to use a prefix XOR array and some counting logic, but it does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description.

One specific issue is in the way the program calculates the number of valid tuples. The logic for updating `pre` and `suf` arrays and calculating `ans` is not aligned with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the condition f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
6 2 4
```
The expected output is 4, as described in the problem statement. However, the program's logic for updating `pre` and `suf` and calculating `ans` does not correctly handle this case, and it will likely produce an incorrect result.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Compute the prefix XOR array.
2. Iterate over all possible tuples (x, y, z) and check the condition f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z).
3. Count the number of tuples that satisfy the condition.

The provided program does not follow this approach and thus is incorrect.
