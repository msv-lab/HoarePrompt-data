Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged. `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`.** 

The code initializes a new list `suf` with 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`. The values of `prefix`, `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`, and `pre` remain unchanged.
