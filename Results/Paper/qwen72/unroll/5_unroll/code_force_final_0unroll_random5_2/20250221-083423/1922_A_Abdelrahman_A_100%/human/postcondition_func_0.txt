The function does not accept any parameters. It reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` and composed of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function checks if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. If such a template exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The variable `tests` retains its initial value, and the variables `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` hold the values of the last test case processed. The variable `no` will be `False` if any of the test cases resulted in a 'YES' print statement, otherwise it will be `True`. The variable `counter` will be equal to the length of the last processed string `c`.
