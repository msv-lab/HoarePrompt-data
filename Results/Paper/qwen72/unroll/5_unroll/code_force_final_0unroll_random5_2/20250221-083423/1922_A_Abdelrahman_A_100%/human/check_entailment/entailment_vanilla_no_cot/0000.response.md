Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in how it checks for the existence of a template that matches the conditions. Specifically, the program incorrectly checks if the characters of string `c` are not in the corresponding positions of strings `a` and `b`. This logic does not correctly implement the template matching rules as described in the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for _ in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        # Check if a and b can form a valid template
        template_possible = True
        for i in range(slength):
            if a[i] != b[i]:
                template_possible = False
                break
        
        if not template_possible:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if c can be matched with the template
        can_be_template = True
        for i in range(slength):
            if a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]:
                can_be_template = False
                break
        
        if can_be_template:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Template Possibility Check**: The program first checks if `a` and `b` can form a valid template. For a valid template, `a` and `b` must have the same characters at each position. If they differ at any position, it's impossible to form a template that both `a` and `b` match, so the program prints 'NO' and moves to the next test case.

2. **Template Matching Check**: If `a` and `b` can form a valid template, the program then checks if `c` can match this template. For `c` to not match the template, at least one character in `c` must be the same as the corresponding character in `a` or `b`.

3. **Output**: Based on the checks, the program prints 'YES' if `c` does not match the template, and 'NO' otherwise.

This corrected version ensures that the template matching rules are correctly applied, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.
