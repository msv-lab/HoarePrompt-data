### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program then iterates over each test case, extracting the length `n` and the password string from the list.
   - This part of the program is correct and efficiently handles the input.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for checking if the password meets the given conditions.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters` to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - It iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - It then checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter:
     - It keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
     - If a letter is found and `last_digit_index` is not `-1`, it means a digit comes after a letter, and the function returns 'NO'.
     - This logic is correct and ensures that no digit follows a letter.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
     - This is done by comparing `digits` with `sorted(digits)`, which is correct.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
     - This is done by comparing `letters` with `sorted(letters)`, which is correct.
   - If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.
   - The function correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description.

3. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case in the `results` list and prints them all at once, separated by newlines.
   - This part of the program is correct and ensures that the output format matches the problem requirements.

### Verification:

- **Condition 1:**
  - The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
  - This is implicitly handled by the `isdigit` and `isalpha` checks in the `func_1` function. Any character that is not a digit or a letter will not be processed, and the function will not return an incorrect result due to this condition.

- **Condition 2:**
  - There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
  - The function correctly checks this by maintaining `last_digit_index` and returning 'NO' if a letter is found after a digit.

- **Condition 3:**
  - All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - The function correctly checks this by comparing `digits` with `sorted(digits)`.

- **Condition 4:**
  - All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - The function correctly checks this by comparing `letters` with `sorted(letters)`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. It handles the input and output as required, and the logic for checking the password strength is accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
