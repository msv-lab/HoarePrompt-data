You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: *`digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password` string in the order they appear; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string, or -1 if there are no digits.

        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: *`digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string, or -1 if there are no digits.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `password` consisting of 1 to 20 characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. It returns 'NO' if any of the following conditions are met: 1) There is a digit followed by a letter in the `password` string, or 2) The digits in the `password` are not in non-decreasing order, or 3) The letters in the `password` are not in non-decreasing order. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program then iterates over each test case, extracting the length `n` and the password string from the list.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for checking if the password meets the given conditions.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters` to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - It iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - It then checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter:
     - It keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
     - If a letter is found and `last_digit_index` is not `-1`, it means a digit comes after a letter, and the function returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case in the `results` list and prints them all at once, separated by newlines.

### Verification:

- **Condition 1:**
  - The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
  - This is implicitly handled by the `isdigit` and `isalpha` checks in the `func_1` function.

- **Condition 2:**
  - There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
  - The function correctly checks this by maintaining `last_digit_index` and returning 'NO' if a letter is found after a digit.

- **Condition 3:**
  - All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - The function correctly checks this by comparing `digits` with `sorted(digits)`.

- **Condition 4:**
  - All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - The function correctly checks this by comparing `letters` with `sorted(letters)`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. It handles the input and output as required, and the logic for checking the password strength is accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**
