You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `password` consisting of 1 to 20 characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. It returns 'NO' if any of the following conditions are met: 1) There is a digit followed by a letter in the `password` string, or 2) The digits in the `password` are not in non-decreasing order, or 3) The letters in the `password` are not in non-decreasing order. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly verifies the strong password conditions as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Condition 1: Password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.**
   - The program implicitly checks this condition by using the `isdigit()` and the `else` block, which only processes lowercase letters. If any character is not a digit or a lowercase letter, it will not be processed, and the program will not fail because it only checks the sorting and order of digits and letters.

2. **Condition 2: There should be no digit that comes after a letter.**
   - The program correctly implements this condition by maintaining a `last_digit_index` variable. If a digit is found, it updates this index. If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not -1), the function returns 'NO'.

3. **Condition 3: All digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order.**
   - The program checks this by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version. If they are not the same, the function returns 'NO'.

4. **Condition 4: All letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order.**
   - The program checks this by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version. If they are not the same, the function returns 'NO'.

The program processes the input correctly, handling multiple test cases and ensuring that all the conditions are met for each password. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the program to fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
