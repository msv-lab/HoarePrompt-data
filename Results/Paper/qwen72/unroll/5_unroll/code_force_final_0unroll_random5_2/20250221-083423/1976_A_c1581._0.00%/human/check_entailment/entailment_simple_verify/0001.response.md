### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program then iterates over each test case, extracting the length `n` and the password string from the list.
   - This part of the program is correct and handles the input as expected.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for checking if the password meets the given conditions.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters` to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - It iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - This part correctly separates the digits and letters from the password.

3. **Condition 2:**
   - The function checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter:
     - It keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
     - If a letter is found and `last_digit_index` is not `-1`, it means a digit comes after a letter, and the function returns 'NO'.
   - This part correctly implements the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

4. **Condition 3:**
   - The function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - This part correctly implements the condition that all digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

5. **Condition 4:**
   - The function checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - This part correctly implements the condition that all letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

6. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case in the `results` list and prints them all at once, separated by newlines.
   - This part is correct and handles the output as expected.

### Verification Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `password` is a string consisting of 1 to 20 characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
  - This is consistent with the problem description and the input parsing logic.

- **State after separating digits and letters:**
  - `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the `password` string in the order they appear.
  - `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password` string in the order they appear.
  - This state is correctly maintained by the program.

- **State after checking for digits after letters:**
  - `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string, or -1 if there are no digits.
  - If a letter is found after a digit, the function returns 'NO'.
  - This state and logic are correctly implemented.

- **State after checking if digits are sorted:**
  - `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - If `digits` is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'.
  - This state and logic are correctly implemented.

- **State after checking if letters are sorted:**
  - `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - If `letters` is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'.
  - This state and logic are correctly implemented.

- **Final state:**
  - If all conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'.
  - This state and logic are correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. It handles the input and output as required, and the logic for checking the password strength is accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**
