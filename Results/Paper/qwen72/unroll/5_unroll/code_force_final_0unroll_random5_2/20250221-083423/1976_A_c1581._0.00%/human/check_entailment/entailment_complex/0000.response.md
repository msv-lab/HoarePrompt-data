Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by extracting the password length `n` and the password itself. This part is correct as it ensures that the input is handled as specified.

2. **Character Separation**: The function `func_1` separates the characters in the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This is done correctly by checking if each character is a digit or a letter and appending it to the respective list.

3. **Digit After Letter Check**: The function checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. It does this by maintaining a `last_digit_index` variable and iterating through the password. If a letter is found after a digit, the function immediately returns 'NO'. This is correct as it ensures that the condition "there should be no digit that comes after a letter" is met.

4. **Sorting Check**: The function checks if the `digits` list and the `letters` list are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing the lists to their sorted versions. If either list is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'. This is correct as it ensures that the conditions "all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order" and "all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order" are met.

5. **Final Return**: If none of the conditions that would cause a 'NO' return are met, the function returns 'YES'. This is correct as it ensures that the password meets all the required conditions.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
