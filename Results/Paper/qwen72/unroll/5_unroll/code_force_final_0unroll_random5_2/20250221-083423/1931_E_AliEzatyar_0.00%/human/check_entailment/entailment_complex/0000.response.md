### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results of each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It reads the list of integers `array` and initializes `total_digits` to 0 and `zeros` to an empty list.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program iterates over each item in the `array` and adds the length of the string representation of the item to `total_digits`.
   - It calls `func_1` to count the number of trailing zeros in each item and appends the result to the `zeros` list.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of a number.
   - It iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, incrementing a counter for each trailing zero until it encounters a non-zero digit.
   - The function returns the count of trailing zeros.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It calculates `subtract_zero` by summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` list starting from the first element.
   - The program then checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is true, it sets `answers[test]` to 'Sashah' (which should be 'Sasha').
   - If the condition is false, it sets `answers[test]` to 'Anna'.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results stored in `answers`.

### Issues:
- **Typographical Error:** The string 'Sashah' should be 'Sasha'. This is a minor issue but will cause the output to be incorrect.
- **Logical Error:** The program's logic for determining the winner is flawed. The game is about the final number being greater than or equal to \(10^m\), not just the total number of digits after subtracting some zeros. The current logic does not accurately simulate the game's rules.

### Correctness:
- **False:** The program has a typographical error and a logical error in the winning condition check.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

### Correctness:
- **False:** The program is incorrect due to the logical error in the winning condition check. The corrected program should accurately simulate the game's rules, but the current logic does not do that.
