Precondition: **The function should take two integers, n and k, as input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and return a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and exactly k of the n cyclic shifts of the list are sorted. If no such list exists, the function should return -1.**
