Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling `k >= 2` and `n == k`**:
   - The program prints an array of `k` elements, each equal to `k`, when `n == k`. This is incorrect because the array should have `n` elements, not `k` elements. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the program should print `1 1 1` or any other array of 3 elements that are all equal, but it prints `3 3 3` instead.

2. **Handling `k >= 2` and `n != k`**:
   - The program prints `-1` when `n != k` and `k >= 2`. This is not always correct. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Handling `k == 1`**:
   - The program prints an array of `n` elements, each equal to `j + 1` where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`. This is correct for `k == 1` because the array will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to handle the following cases:

- **If `k == n`**:
  - The array can be any array where all elements are the same. For example, `[1, 1, ..., 1]` or `[2, 2, ..., 2]`.

- **If `k == 1`**:
  - The array can be any strictly increasing sequence followed by a smaller number. For example, `[1, 2, 3, 1]` for `n = 4`.

- **If `1 < k < n`**:
  - The array can be constructed by having `k` elements in a strictly increasing sequence followed by `n - k` elements that are all equal to the last element of the increasing sequence. For example, `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]` for `n = 5` and `k = 3`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k == n:
            print(*[1 for _ in range(n)])
        elif k == 1:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])
        elif 1 < k < n:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(k)] + [k for _ in range(n - k)])
        else:
            print('-1')

func()
```

This corrected program should handle all cases correctly as per the problem description.
