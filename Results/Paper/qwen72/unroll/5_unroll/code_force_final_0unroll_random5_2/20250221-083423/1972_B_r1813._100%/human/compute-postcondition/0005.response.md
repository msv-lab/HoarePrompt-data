Output State: **The `t` variable remains unchanged, and `index` is now `t * 2 + 1`. The `n` and `s` variables are set to the last values read from the `data` list. The `count_u` variable is set to the count of 'U' in the last `s` string. The loop has printed 'YES' if the count of 'U' in each `s` string was odd, and 'NO' if it was even.**
