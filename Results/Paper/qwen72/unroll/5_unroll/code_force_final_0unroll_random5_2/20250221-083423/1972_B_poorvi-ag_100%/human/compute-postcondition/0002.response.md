The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, and `t` represents the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list**
