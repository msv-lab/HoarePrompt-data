Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read two integers `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` is 1, it will print `n` repetitions of the string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet. If `k` is greater than 1, it will print `2 - (n == 1)` repetitions of the string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet. The values of `n` and `k` will be updated with each iteration, and the variable `s` will be reset to an empty string at the beginning of each iteration.**
