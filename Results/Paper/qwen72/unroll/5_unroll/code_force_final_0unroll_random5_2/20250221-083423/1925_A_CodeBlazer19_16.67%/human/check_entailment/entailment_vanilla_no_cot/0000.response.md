Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not generate the correct output for all test cases. Specifically, the program constructs a string `s` that contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and then prints a string based on the value of `k` and `n`. However, this approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of the generated string `s`.

### Issues:
1. **String Construction**: The program constructs `s` by simply concatenating the first `k` alphabets. This does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are included in `s`.

2. **Output for `k > 1`**: The program prints `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`, which means it prints `s` twice if `n > 1` and once if `n == 1`. This is not sufficient to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are included in the output string.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to construct a string `s` that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. One way to do this is to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of length `n` appears as a substring. However, for simplicity, you can also construct a string by repeating the first `k` alphabets enough times to ensure all subsequences are included.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        alphabet = ''.join(chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k))
        if k == 1:
            print(n * alphabet)
        else:
            # Construct a string that ensures all subsequences of length n are included
            s = alphabet * (k ** (n - 1))
            print(s)

func()
```

This solution constructs a string `s` by repeating the first `k` alphabets `k^(n-1)` times, which ensures that all possible subsequences of length `n` are included in `s`. This approach is correct and meets the problem requirements.
