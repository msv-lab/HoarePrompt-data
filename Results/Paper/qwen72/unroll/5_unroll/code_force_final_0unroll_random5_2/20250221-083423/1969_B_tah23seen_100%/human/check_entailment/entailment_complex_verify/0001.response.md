### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calls the function `func_1` to compute the minimum cost to sort the string.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes two variables: `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
   - If the character is '0' and there are some '1's before it (i.e., `one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`.
   - The logic here is to count the number of '1's before each '0' and add `one + 1` to the cost. This is because to move a '0' past all the '1's before it, you need to perform a cyclic shift of the substring that includes the '0' and all the '1's before it.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The goal is to sort the binary string in non-descending order, which means all '0's should come before all '1's.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift of a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the cost by considering each '0' that appears after a '1'. For each such '0', it adds the number of '1's before it plus one to the cost.
   - This approach ensures that the minimum number of cyclic shifts is performed to move each '0' past all the '1's before it.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the string has no '0's (e.g., "1111"), the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the string has no '1's (e.g., "0000"), the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the string has a mix of '0's and '1's, the function correctly calculates the cost to move each '0' past all the '1's before it.
   - The annotated code confirms that the state of the program is correctly maintained and the output is as expected.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The function `func_1` runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the string `s`.
   - The overall complexity of the program is O(T * n), where T is the number of test cases and n is the length of the string in each test case. This is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order. It handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the result for each test case.

Final: **True**
