Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `s` and returns an integer `cost` representing the total cost calculated based on the number of '0's that follow '1's in the string. The string `s` remains unchanged after the function call. The cost is incremented by the count of '1's plus one for each '0' that follows a '1' in the string. **
