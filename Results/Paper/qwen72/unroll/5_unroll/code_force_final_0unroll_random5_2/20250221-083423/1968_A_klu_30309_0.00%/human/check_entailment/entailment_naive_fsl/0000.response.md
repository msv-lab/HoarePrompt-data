Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is a prime number correctly. For a prime number `x`, the only `y` that satisfies `1 <= y < x` and maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` is `y = 1`, because the only divisor of a prime number `x` (other than `x` itself) is `1`. However, the function `func_1` skips `y = 1` in the loop (`range(x - 1, 1, -1)`), and thus it will not return `1` for prime numbers. For example, for `x = 7`, the correct output should be `1`, but the program will return `6`, which is incorrect.
