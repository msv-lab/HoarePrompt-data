You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find such a \( y \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over all possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - It checks if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)).
   - If \( y \) is a divisor and \( 2 * y \ge x \), it returns \( y \) immediately.
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the largest divisor found during the iteration.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - If \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \).
   - Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = y + y = 2y \).
   - The condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) ensures that \( y \) is at least half of \( x \), which is a strong candidate for maximizing \( 2y \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is the maximum possible.
   - For \( x = 3 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(3, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is the maximum possible.
   - For \( x = 4 \), the possible \( y \) values are 1 and 2. \( \gcd(4, 2) + 2 = 4 \), which is the maximum possible.
   - For \( x = 5 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(5, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is the maximum possible.
   - For \( x = 6 \), the possible \( y \) values are 1, 2, and 3. \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 6 \), which is the maximum possible.

5. **General Case**:
   - For any \( x \), the function will find the largest divisor \( y \) of \( x \) that is less than \( x \).
   - If \( 2 * y \ge x \), it returns \( y \) immediately, which is the optimal \( y \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the largest divisor found, which is still a valid \( y \) but not necessarily the optimal one.

6. **Optimality**:
   - The function ensures that it returns the largest \( y \) that satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \), which is the optimal solution.
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the largest divisor, which is a valid \( y \) but not necessarily the optimal one. However, the problem allows for any \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \), so this is still correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct because it finds a valid \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for each test case. The logic ensures that the largest possible \( y \) is returned, which is optimal when \( 2 * y \ge x \).

Correctness: **True**
