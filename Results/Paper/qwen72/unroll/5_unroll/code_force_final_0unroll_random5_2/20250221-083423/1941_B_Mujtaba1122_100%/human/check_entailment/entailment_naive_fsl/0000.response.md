Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` is flawed. The function attempts to reduce the elements of the array to zero by performing the operation, but it does not correctly account for the possibility of negative values or the need to ensure that the operation can be applied in a way that all elements become zero.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
n = 5
list = [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]
```

The program will output "NO" for this input, but it should output "YES" because it is possible to make all elements zero using the described operations as shown in the problem description.

### Why the Program Fails:
1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The program uses `list[i - 1]` to determine the number of times to apply the operation, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `list[i - 1]` is large, it might reduce `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` to negative values, which is not allowed.
2. **No Check for Negative Values**: The program does not check if any element becomes negative after applying the operation, which would make it impossible to achieve the desired result.
3. **Inefficient Logic**: The logic in `func_2` is not efficient and does not guarantee that the operation will be applied in a way that all elements become zero.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to ensure that the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 4 (since each operation reduces the sum by 4) and that the elements can be reduced to zero without any element becoming negative. A more efficient and correct approach would involve checking the sum and ensuring that the elements can be reduced in a valid manner.
