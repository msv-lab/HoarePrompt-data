### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Calls:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `lst`.
   - It then calls the function `func_2(lst, n)` to determine if the array can be made all zeros.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if all elements in the list from index 0 to `n-1` are zero.
   - If any element is not zero, it returns `False`.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function iterates over the elements from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., `i` ranges from 1 to `n-2`).
   - For each element `i`, it performs the operation as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - The operation reduces `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by `1`, `2 * list[i-1]`, and `1 * list[i-1]` respectively.
   - If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, it prints 'no' and returns, indicating that it is not possible to make all elements zero.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Operation:**
   - The operation inside the `while` loop is incorrect. It should reduce `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the current implementation reduces `list[i]` and `list[i+1]` by `2 * list[i-1]` and `1 * list[i-1]`, which is not the correct operation as described in the problem.

2. **Early Termination:**
   - The program prints 'no' and returns if `list[i-1]` is not zero, but this is not the correct condition for early termination. The correct condition should be if any element in the list cannot be reduced to zero due to the constraints of the operation.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be zero or where the array might have elements that cannot be reduced to zero due to the constraints of the operation.

### Corrected Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i + 1] -= 1
        
        if list[i] < 0 or list[i - 1] < 0 or list[i + 1] < 0:
            print('NO')
            return
    
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is **incorrect** due to the issues in the operation logic and early termination conditions.

Correctness: **False**
