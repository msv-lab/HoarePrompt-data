You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. The list `a` should have a length of `n` and each element `a_i` should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The integer `n` should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        last_year = a[0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        
        results.append(str(last_year))
        
    #State: The `results` list will contain `T` elements, each representing the last year calculated for each test case. The `index` variable will be equal to `2 + T * (n + 1)`, where `n` is the number of signs in the last test case. The `T` variable will remain unchanged.
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is designed to process a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`, where `a` represents the periodicities of the signs and `n` is the number of signs. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` ranging from 1 to 1000. The function returns a result based on the periodicities and the number of signs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
