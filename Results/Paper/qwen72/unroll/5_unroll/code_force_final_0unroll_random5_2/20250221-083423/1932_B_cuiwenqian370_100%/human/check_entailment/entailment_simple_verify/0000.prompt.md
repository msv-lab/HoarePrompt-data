You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. The list `a` should have a length of `n` and each element `a_i` should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The integer `n` should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

    #State: The `results` list will contain `T` elements, each representing the last year calculated for each test case. The `index` variable will be equal to `2 + T * (n + 1)`, where `n` is the number of signs in the last test case. The `T` variable will remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. Here’s a breakdown of the key parts of the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases and the periodicities of the signs for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity.
   - It then iterates through the remaining signs, calculating the next year in which each sign will occur strictly after the previous one using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program appends the result for each test case to a list and writes the results to the standard output.

The logic in the program ensures that the signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous one, which aligns with the problem description. The formula used to calculate the next year is correct and handles all edge cases, including when the periodicity of the signs is 1.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
