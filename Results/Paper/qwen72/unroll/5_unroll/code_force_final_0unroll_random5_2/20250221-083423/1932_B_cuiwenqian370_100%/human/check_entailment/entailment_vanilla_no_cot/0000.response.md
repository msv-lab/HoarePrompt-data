Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Test Case Loop**: The program iterates over the number of test cases, `T`.

3. **Sign Periodicity Reading**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and the list of periodicities, `a`.

4. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - It initializes `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity, `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

5. **Updating the Last Year**: It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

6. **Storing Results**: It appends the final year for each test case to the `results` list.

7. **Output**: Finally, it writes all the results to the standard output, each on a new line.

The logic and implementation are correct and match the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
