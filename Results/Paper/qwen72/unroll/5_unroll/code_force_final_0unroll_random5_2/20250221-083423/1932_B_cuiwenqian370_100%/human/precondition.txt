The function `main` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The function should read the input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by `t` test cases, each with two lines: the first line is the integer `n`, and the second line is a list of `n` integers `a`.
