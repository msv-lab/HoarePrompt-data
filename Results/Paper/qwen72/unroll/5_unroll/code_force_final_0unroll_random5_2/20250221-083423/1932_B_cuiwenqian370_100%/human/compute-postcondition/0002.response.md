Output State: **The function should still take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. The list `a` should have a length of `n` and each element `a_i` should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The integer `n` should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The function should still be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The `input` function is now set to read from `sys.stdin`. `data` is a list of strings split from the input. `index` is 0.**
