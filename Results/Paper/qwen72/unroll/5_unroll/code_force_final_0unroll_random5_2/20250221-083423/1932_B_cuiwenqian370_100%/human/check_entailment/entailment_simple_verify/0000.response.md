Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for handling large inputs and ensures that all data is read before processing.
   - The variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the `data` list, which is a common and effective approach for parsing input in this format.
   - The number of test cases `T` is correctly extracted from the first element of the `data` list.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program correctly extracts the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - The variable `last_year` is initialized to the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`, which is the correct starting point.
   - The program then iterates through the remaining signs, calculating the next year in which each sign will occur strictly after the previous one using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.

3. **Formula Explanation**:
   - The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` is used to find the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`. This ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
   - The expression `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1)` ensures that we start looking for the next multiple from `last_year + 1`.
   - The division and multiplication by `a[i]` ensures that we get the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program appends the result for each test case to a list `results` and writes the results to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the periodicity of the signs is 1 correctly. For example, if all signs have a periodicity of 1, the program will correctly output the year `n` for each test case.
   - The program also handles the case where the periodicity of the signs is large (up to \(10^6\)) and the number of signs is large (up to 100) correctly.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
