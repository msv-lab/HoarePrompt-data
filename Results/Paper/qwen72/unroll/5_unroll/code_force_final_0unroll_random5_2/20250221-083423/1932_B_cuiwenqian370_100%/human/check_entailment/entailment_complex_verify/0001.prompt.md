You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. The list `a` should have a length of `n` and each element `a_i` should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The integer `n` should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1

        results.append(str(last_year))
        
    #State: The `results` list will contain `T` elements, each representing the last year calculated for each test case. The `index` variable will be equal to `2 + T * (n + 1)`, where `n` is the number of signs in the last test case. The `T` variable will remain unchanged.
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and writes the results to standard output. Each test case involves a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`, where `a` represents the periodicities of signs and `n` is the number of signs. The function calculates the last year when all signs align based on their periodicities and appends this year to a results list. After processing all test cases, the function writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling input, especially when the input is large and multiple test cases are involved.
   - The program initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the input list and reads the number of test cases `T` from the first element of the list.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a` from the input list.
   - The program then initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`, which is the year when the first sign occurs.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - The program iterates through the list of periodicities starting from the second sign.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.
   - The program updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - Finally, the program writes the results to the standard output, each on a new line.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - Initial `last_year` = 3
  - For `a[1]` = 2: Next year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4
  - For `a[2]` = 4: Next year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8
  - For `a[3]` = 5: Next year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10
  - For `a[4]` = 9: Next year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18
  - For `a[5]` = 18: Next year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36
  - Output: 36

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `1 2 3 4 5`
  - Initial `last_year` = 1
  - For `a[1]` = 2: Next year = (1 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 2
  - For `a[2]` = 3: Next year = (2 + 1 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 3
  - For `a[3]` = 4: Next year = (3 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 4
  - For `a[4]` = 5: Next year = (4 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 5
  - Output: 5

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `1 1 1 1 1`
  - Initial `last_year` = 1
  - For `a[1]` = 1: Next year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 2
  - For `a[2]` = 1: Next year = (2 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 3
  - For `a[3]` = 1: Next year = (3 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 4
  - For `a[4]` = 1: Next year = (4 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 5
  - Output: 5

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - Initial `last_year` = 50
  - For `a[1]` = 30: Next year = (50 + 1 + 30 - 1) // 30 * 30 = 60
  - For `a[2]` = 711: Next year = (60 + 1 + 711 - 1) // 711 * 711 = 711
  - For `a[3]` = 200: Next year = (711 + 1 + 200 - 1) // 200 * 200 = 800
  - For `a[4]` = 503: Next year = (800 + 1 + 503 - 1) // 503 * 503 = 1006
  - For `a[5]` = 1006: Next year = (1006 + 1 + 1006 - 1) // 1006 * 1006 = 2012
  - Output: 2012

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year when the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The formula used to calculate the next year is accurate and the program handles multiple test cases correctly.
