Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The core logic of the program is to calculate the next year for each sign based on the last year when the previous sign occurred. This is done using the formula:

\[ \text{next\_year} = \left( \text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1 \right) // \text{a[i]} * \text{a[i]} \]

This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of \( \text{a[i]} \) that is greater than \( \text{last\_year} + 1 \). This is correct because it aligns with the problem's requirement that the signs must occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign.

The program reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and writes the results to standard output in the required format. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing multiple test cases and calculating the correct year for each case.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct and meets all the specified requirements.

Correctness: **True**
