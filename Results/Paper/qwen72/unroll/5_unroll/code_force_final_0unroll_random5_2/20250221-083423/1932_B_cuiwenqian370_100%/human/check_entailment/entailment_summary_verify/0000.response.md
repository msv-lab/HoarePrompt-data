Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `T` and the periodicities of the signs for each test case.
   - This approach is efficient and handles the input correctly.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining signs, calculating the next year in which each sign will occur strictly after the previous one using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
   - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

3. **Formula Explanation**:
   - The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` can be broken down as follows:
     - `last_year + 1` ensures that the next year is strictly after `last_year`.
     - `+ a[i] - 1` is used to find the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
     - `// a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the result is a multiple of `a[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program appends the result for each test case to a list and writes the results to the standard output, each on a new line.
   - This output format matches the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when the periodicity of the signs is 1. For example, in the test case where all signs have a periodicity of 1, the program correctly outputs 5.
   - The program also handles larger periodicities and multiple test cases as shown in the example.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases. The formula used to calculate the next year is correct and ensures that each sign occurs sequentially and strictly after the previous one.

Final: **True**
