Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key parts of the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases and the periodicities of the signs for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity.
   - It then iterates through the remaining signs, calculating the next year in which each sign will occur strictly after the previous one using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program appends the result for each test case to a list and writes the results to the standard output.

The logic in the program ensures that the signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous one, which aligns with the problem description. The formula used to calculate the next year is correct and handles all edge cases, including when the periodicity of the signs is 1.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
