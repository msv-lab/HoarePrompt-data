#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a list of integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks in each test case, and a list of lists a where each sublist contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. `t` remains the same input integer between 1 and 100. `n` remains the same input integer. `a` remains the same list of integers input by the user. `ans` remains 0.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each value in `cnt` by 3, while `cnt`, `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the integer division of each value in cnt by 3)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, which represents the number of sticks, and then reads a list of `n` integers `a` from the user input, representing the lengths of the sticks. The function calculates the number of complete sets of three sticks that have the same length and prints this count. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the printed count of such sets, while the variables `n`, `a`, and the internal dictionary `cnt` used for counting are no longer accessible outside the function.
