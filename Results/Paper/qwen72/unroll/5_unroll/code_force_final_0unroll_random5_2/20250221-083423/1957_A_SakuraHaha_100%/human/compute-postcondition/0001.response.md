Output State: **The function should take three parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a list of integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks in each test case, and a list of lists a where each sublist contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. The initial state information about `t`, `n`, and the structure of `a` remains valid, but `a` is now specifically a list of integers provided by the user.
