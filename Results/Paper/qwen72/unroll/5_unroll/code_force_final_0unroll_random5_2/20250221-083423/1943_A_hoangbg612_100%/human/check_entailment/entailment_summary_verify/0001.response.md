### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and removing them.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c`, while Bob just removes the picked element.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game, where both players play optimally.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest available number that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the optimal picking strategy.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the frequency of each number in `N`.

4. **Loop Through the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this is the smallest number that is not in `N`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and updates the dictionary `M` with the frequency of `cur`.
   - If the current number `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the frequency of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the sum of the frequencies in `M` equals `S`.
     - If it does, it increments `cur` by 1, as all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present in `N`.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys in `M` that have a frequency of 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it sets `cur` to the second smallest number in `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

6. **Issues in the Program:**
   - **Incorrect MEX Calculation:** The program does not correctly handle the case where Bob can pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX. The logic for updating `cur` and the dictionary `M` is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly track the MEX value as it should.
   - **Logical Flaws:** The program's logic for determining the MEX value is not optimal and can lead to incorrect results. For example, the program increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, which does not necessarily reflect the optimal play.
   - **Frequency Tracking:** The use of `M` to track frequencies and the subsequent logic to determine the MEX is not optimal. The program should focus on the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and ensure that both players play optimally.

7. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves tracking the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and ensuring that both players play optimally.
   - Alice should always pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and is available in `a`.
   - Bob should pick the smallest number that is available in `a` but not necessarily the smallest number that is not yet in `c`.

### Detailed Analysis of the Program:

- **Sorting the Array:**
  - Sorting the array `N` is a good step as it helps in determining the smallest available number efficiently.

- **Tracking MEX:**
  - The variable `cur` is used to track the current MEX, but the logic for updating `cur` is flawed.
  - The program should track the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and ensure that both players play optimally.

- **Dictionary `M`:**
  - The dictionary `M` is used to track the frequency of each number in `N`, but this is not necessary for determining the MEX.
  - The program should focus on the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and ensure that both players play optimally.

- **Breaking the Loop:**
  - The program breaks the loop when it finds a number `num` that is greater than `cur + 1`, which is not the correct way to determine the MEX.
  - The MEX should be determined by finding the smallest number that is not in `c` after all elements have been processed.

- **Final MEX Calculation:**
  - The final MEX calculation logic is flawed. The program should correctly determine the MEX by checking the smallest number that is not in `c` after all elements have been processed.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and has logical issues in determining the MEX value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
