### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and removing them.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c`, while Bob just removes the picked element.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game, where both players play optimally.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest available number that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the optimal picking strategy.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the frequency of each number in `N`.

4. **Loop Through the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this is the smallest number that is not in `N`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and updates the dictionary `M` with the frequency of `cur`.
   - If the current number `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the frequency of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the sum of the frequencies in `M` equals `S`.
     - If it does, it increments `cur` by 1, as all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present in `N`.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys in `M` that have a frequency of 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it sets `cur` to the second smallest number in `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

6. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where Bob can pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.
   - The logic for updating `cur` and the dictionary `M` is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly track the MEX value as it should.
   - The use of `M` to track frequencies and the subsequent logic to determine the MEX is not optimal and can lead to incorrect results.

7. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves tracking the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and ensuring that both players play optimally.
   - Alice should always pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and is available in `a`.
   - Bob should pick the smallest number that is available in `a` but not necessarily the smallest number that is not yet in `c`.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and the size of the array `S` and the array `N` for each test case.
  - The array `N` is sorted, which is a good step to facilitate the optimal picking strategy.

- **MEX Calculation:**
  - The program initializes `cur` to -1, which is a reasonable starting point for tracking the MEX.
  - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` and the dictionary `M` to track the frequency of each number.
  - However, the logic for updating `cur` is flawed. Specifically, the program breaks the loop when it finds a number greater than `cur + 1`, which is not the correct way to determine the MEX.

- **Optimal Play:**
  - The program does not correctly simulate the optimal play for both Alice and Bob.
  - Alice should always pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and is available in `a`.
  - Bob should pick the smallest number that is available in `a` but not necessarily the smallest number that is not yet in `c`.

- **Final MEX Calculation:**
  - The program checks if the sum of the frequencies in `M` equals `S` and increments `cur` by 1 if it does. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal play of both players.
  - The program then creates a list `cnt` of keys in `M` that have a frequency of 1 and sets `cur` to the second smallest number in `cnt` if the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. This logic is also incorrect and does not align with the optimal strategy for determining the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and has logical issues in determining the MEX value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
