Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific issue is in the logic for determining the MEX value. The current implementation has a flaw in how it updates the `cur` variable and the dictionary `M`.

### Case where the program fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```

Expected output: `4`

Actual output: `2`

### Explanation of the failure:
1. **Input Parsing and Sorting:**
   - `T = 1` (one test case)
   - `S = 5` (array size)
   - `N = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]` (array elements)
   - After sorting, `N = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]`

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - `cur = -1`
   - `M = {}`
   - Iterating through the sorted array:
     - `num = 0`: `cur = 0`, `M[0] = 1`
     - `num = 1`: `cur = 1`, `M[1] = 1`
     - `num = 2`: `cur = 2`, `M[2] = 1`
     - `num = 2`: `M[2] = 2`
     - `num = 3`: `cur = 3`, `M[3] = 1`

3. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`:
     - `sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) = 5` (which is equal to `S`)
     - Therefore, `cur += 1` (making `cur = 4`)
   - The program then checks if there are at least two keys in `M` with a value of 1:
     - `cnt = [0, 1, 2, 3]` (all keys have a value of 1)
     - Since `len(cnt) >= 2`, `cur = cnt[1]` (making `cur = 1`)

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints `1` instead of the correct MEX value `4`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the MEX value, the program should:
1. Track the presence of each integer in the array.
2. Simulate the optimal moves for Alice and Bob.
3. Calculate the MEX value based on the final state of the array `c`.

A correct implementation would involve:
- Using a set or a dictionary to track the presence of each integer.
- Simulating the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob.
- Ensuring that Alice always picks the smallest available integer that is not in `c` to maximize the MEX.
- Ensuring that Bob picks the smallest available integer to minimize the MEX.

The current implementation does not correctly simulate the game and fails to handle cases where the MEX value is higher than the last element in the array.
