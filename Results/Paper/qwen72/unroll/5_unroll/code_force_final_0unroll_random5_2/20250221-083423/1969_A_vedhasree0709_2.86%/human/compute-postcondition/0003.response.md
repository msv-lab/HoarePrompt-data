Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user for a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `l`. It then checks if there is a pair of consecutive indices `i` and `i+1` in the list `l` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and stops checking further for that test case. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed. The input variables `t` and `test_cases` are not used in the function as provided, and the function does not modify any external state. **
