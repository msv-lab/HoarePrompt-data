Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
3
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
3
2
```

While the program produces the correct output for the provided test cases, it fails to handle other cases correctly. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
4
4 1 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this case, the program incorrectly prints `3` instead of `2`. The correct approach would be to identify the smallest set of friends that can be invited such that at least 2 friends attend the party. The program's logic is too simplistic and does not account for all possible configurations of best friends. It only checks for a specific pattern (`l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`) and prints `2` if it finds it, otherwise it prints `3`. This does not cover all possible scenarios and is therefore incorrect.
