Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. It only checks for a specific pattern where a friend and their best friend are adjacent in the list and prints `2` if such a pattern is found, otherwise it prints `3`. This approach is flawed because:

1. It does not handle all possible configurations of best friends.
2. It does not correctly identify the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify connected components (or cycles) in the best friend relationships and determine the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Adjust p to be 0-indexed
        p = [x - 1 for x in p]
        
        # Track visited friends
        visited = [False] * n
        
        def find_cycle(start):
            current = start
            cycle_length = 0
            while not visited[current]:
                visited[current] = True
                current = p[current]
                cycle_length += 1
            return cycle_length
        
        min_invitations = n  # Initialize to the maximum possible value
        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                cycle_length = find_cycle(i)
                if cycle_length == 2:
                    min_invitations = 2
                    break
                elif cycle_length > 2:
                    min_invitations = min(min_invitations, cycle_length)
        
        print(min_invitations)

# Example usage
func()
```

This program correctly identifies the minimum number of invitations needed by finding cycles in the best friend relationships and determining the smallest cycle that can ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
