#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `p` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends for each friend.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        i = 0
        
        j = 0
        
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        
        if j == 0:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case. For each test case, it checks if there is a pair of indices `i` and `i+1` in the list `l` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. The variables `i` and `j` are reset to `0` at the beginning of each test case. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 after each test case, and the loop continues until `t` reaches 0. The list `l` and the integer `n` are updated for each test case based on the input. The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user for a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `l`. It then checks if there is a pair of consecutive indices `i` and `i+1` in the list `l` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and stops checking further for that test case. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed. The input variables `t` and `test_cases` are not used in the function as provided, and the function does not modify any external state.
