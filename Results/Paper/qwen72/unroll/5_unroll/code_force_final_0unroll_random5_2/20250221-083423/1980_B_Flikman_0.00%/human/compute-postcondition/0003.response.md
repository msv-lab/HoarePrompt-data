The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `f`, `k`, and a list `a` of integers. The constraints for these parameters are: `1 <= t <= 1000`, `1 <= f, k <= n <= 100`, and `1 <= a_i <= 100`.

The function processes each test case and returns a list of results based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer), `f` (an integer), `k` (an integer), and a list `a` of integers. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results.**
