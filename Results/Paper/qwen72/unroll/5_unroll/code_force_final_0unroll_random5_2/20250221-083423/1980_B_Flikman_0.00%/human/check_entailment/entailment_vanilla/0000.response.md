### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Dmitry has `n` cubes, each showing a value `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
   - The cubes are sorted in non-increasing order.
   - The first `k` cubes are removed.
   - We need to determine if the favorite cube (initially at index `f`) will be removed in all cases, in no cases, or in some cases.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The favorite cube's value is `a[f-1]`.
   - After sorting, the favorite cube can be in any position where the value is `a[f-1]`.
   - We need to count how many cubes have a value greater than `a[f-1]` and how many have the same value as `a[f-1]`.

3. **Logic Breakdown:**
   - **Count of Greater Values (`greater_count`):** This is the number of cubes that have a value strictly greater than the favorite cube's value.
   - **Count of Same Values (`same_value_count`):** This is the number of cubes that have the same value as the favorite cube.
   - **Conditions:**
     - If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will always be among the first `k` cubes, so it will be removed. Output "YES".
     - If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will never be among the first `k` cubes, so it will not be removed. Output "NO".
     - Otherwise, the favorite cube may or may not be among the first `k` cubes, depending on the exact positions of the cubes with the same value. Output "MAYBE".

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k`.
   - It reads the list of values `a`.
   - It calculates `favorite_value` as `a[f-1]`.
   - It counts the number of cubes with the same value as `favorite_value` (`same_value_count`).
   - It counts the number of cubes with a value greater than `favorite_value` (`greater_count`).
   - It checks the conditions and prints the appropriate output.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly handles the three conditions:
     - "YES" if `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`.
     - "NO" if `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`.
     - "MAYBE" otherwise.
   - The program uses the correct indices and conditions to determine the outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or may be removed based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
