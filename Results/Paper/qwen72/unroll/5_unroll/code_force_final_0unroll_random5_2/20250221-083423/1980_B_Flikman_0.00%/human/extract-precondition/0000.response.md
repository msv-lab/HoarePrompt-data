Precondition: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing integers `n`, `f`, `k`, and a list `a` of integers. Each tuple represents a test case where `1 <= t <= 1000`, `1 <= f, k <= n <= 100`, and `1 <= a_i <= 100`.**
