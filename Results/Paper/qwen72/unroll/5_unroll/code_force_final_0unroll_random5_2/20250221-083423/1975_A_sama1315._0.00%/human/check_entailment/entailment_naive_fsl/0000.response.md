Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, it does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix).

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
3 1 2 4 5
```

The expected output is "Yes" because we can split the array into `x = [3]` and `y = [1, 2, 4, 5]`, and after swapping, the array becomes `[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]`, which is not yet sorted. However, we can split it again into `x = [1, 2, 4, 5]` and `y = [3]`, and after swapping, the array becomes `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order.

However, `func_1` will return "No" for this input because it only checks if the array is already sorted, and does not consider the possibility of making it sorted by performing the operation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
