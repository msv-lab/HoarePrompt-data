### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that `func_1` is flawed. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. It does not consider the possibility of making the array sorted by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix).

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns "Yes".
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns "No" without considering any possible splits and swaps.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to extract multiple sets of integer data.
   - It applies `func_1` to each set of integers and collects the results.
   - It prints the results of `func_1` for each set, one result per line.

3. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     Input:
     1
     5
     3 1 2 4 5
     ```
   - The expected output is "Yes" because the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation.
   - However, `func_1` will return "No" for this input because it only checks if the array is already sorted and does not consider the possibility of making it sorted by splitting and swapping.

4. **Correct Logic:**
   - To correctly determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation, we need to check if there exists a split point such that the two parts, when swapped, form a non-decreasing array.
   - This involves checking if the array can be split into two parts where the maximum element of the prefix is less than or equal to the minimum element of the suffix, and both parts are individually sorted.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` is indeed incorrect because it does not implement the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation.

**Final: False**
