Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the problem's requirements. Specifically, `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. It does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a non-decreasing order.

### Issues:
1. **`func_1` Function:**
   - The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function.
   - It does not check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.

2. **`func_2` Function:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case, which is incorrect as `func_1` does not perform the required check.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to check if the array can be split into two parts such that when these parts are swapped, the resulting array is non-decreasing. This involves:
- Finding the point where the array is not in non-decreasing order.
- Checking if the array can be split at this point and if the resulting array after swapping the parts is non-decreasing.

### Example Correct Solution:
```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            # Try to split at this point and check if the resulting array is sorted
            x = arr[:i + 1]
            y = arr[i + 1:]
            if x + y == sorted(x + y):
                return 'Yes'
            if y + x == sorted(y + x):
                return 'Yes'
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = can_be_sorted(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This solution correctly checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping the parts.
