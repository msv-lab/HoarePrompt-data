Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings containing the input values split by whitespace, `input` is now the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `index` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to the integer value of the first element in the `data` list (`data[0]`).
- The values of `n`, `arr`, `data`, `input`, and `index` remain unchanged.
