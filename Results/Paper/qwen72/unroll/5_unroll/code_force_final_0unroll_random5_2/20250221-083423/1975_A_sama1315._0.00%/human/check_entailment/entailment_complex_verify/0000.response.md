Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. It does not implement the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix). 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a split point such that the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the prefix and suffix. This involves finding a point in the array where the elements can be split into two parts, and after swapping these parts, the resulting array is non-decreasing.

The provided `func_1` does not perform this check. Instead, it simply returns "No" if the array is not already sorted, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
