### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is a good approach because it allows us to process the elements in ascending order, which is useful for determining the MEX.

3. **Tracking the Current MEX:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1. This variable will be used to track the current MEX value.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array `N`.

4. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` and `M` accordingly.
   - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks out of the loop. This is because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur + 1` is the MEX.
   - If `num` is exactly `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and records the frequency in `M`.
   - If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, it increments the frequency of `cur` in `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - After processing the array, the program checks if the sum of the frequencies in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1. This step is unnecessary and incorrect because the MEX should be determined by the smallest missing integer, not by the sum of frequencies.
   - The program then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if the frequency of any integer `i` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it updates `cur` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. This is the correct way to determine the MEX.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `cur`, which is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Issues:
- The step `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S: cur += 1` is incorrect. The MEX is determined by the smallest missing integer, not by the sum of frequencies. This step can lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
- The program is mostly correct in its approach to determining the MEX, but the unnecessary and incorrect step mentioned above can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the final MEX calculation that can lead to incorrect results. The step `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S: cur += 1` should be removed to ensure the correct MEX is calculated.
