### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted in ascending order. This is a good approach because it helps in efficiently finding the MEX by ensuring that we can check the smallest missing integer in a sequential manner.

3. **Tracking the Current MEX:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1. This variable will be used to track the current MEX value as the game progresses.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each number in the array `N`.

4. **Iterating Through the Sorted Array:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`.
   - For each number `num` in the array:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is exactly `cur + 1`. If it is, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it means there is a gap in the sequence, and the MEX is `cur + 1`. The program then breaks out of the loop.
   - **Issue:** The logic for updating `M[cur]` when `num` is greater than `cur` is incorrect. The dictionary `M` should be updated to reflect the count of each number in the array, not just the current `cur`. This can lead to incorrect MEX calculations.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals the size of the array `S`. If it does, it means all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present, and the MEX is `cur + 1`.
   - The program then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if the count of any number `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If it finds such a number, it updates `cur` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - **Issue:** The logic for the final MEX calculation is flawed. The program should not increment `cur` by 1 if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. Instead, it should directly return `cur + 1` if `cur` is the last number in the sequence. The second loop is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

6. **Optimal Play:**
   - The program's logic does not correctly simulate the optimal play for both Alice and Bob. The current implementation only checks for the MEX in a sorted array, which does not account for the strategic choices of the players.
   - **Correct Approach:** Alice and Bob should play optimally, which means Alice will always try to pick the smallest number that can extend the sequence, and Bob will try to pick the smallest number that can break the sequence. The program should simulate this process to determine the MEX.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the array is empty or contains only one element.
   - However, the logic for handling repeated elements and the final MEX calculation is incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results in more complex cases.

8. **Efficiency:**
   - The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\) time, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The subsequent iteration through the sorted array and dictionary operations are linear, making the overall complexity \(O(n \log n)\).

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. The issues with the dictionary updates and the final MEX calculation, as well as the lack of simulation for the players' optimal strategies, lead to incorrect results in many cases.

### Final: **False**
