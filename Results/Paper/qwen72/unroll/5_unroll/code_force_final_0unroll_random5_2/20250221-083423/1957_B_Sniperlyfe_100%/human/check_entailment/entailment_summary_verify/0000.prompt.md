You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element of `nums` is set to `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the remaining elements are set to the minimum of `2^(k.bit_length() - 1)` and the remaining value of `k`, ensuring that the sum of all elements in `nums` equals the initial value of `k`. After the function concludes, `k` is reduced to `0` and the list `nums` is returned.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where \( k \) is less than \( n \). According to the problem description, the sum of the sequence \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) must equal \( k \), and each \( a_i \) must be a non-negative integer. However, the current implementation does not ensure that the sum of the sequence equals \( k \) when \( k \) is less than \( n \).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 2
```
The expected output should be a sequence of 3 non-negative integers that sum to 2 and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. A valid sequence could be `2 0 0` or `1 1 0`.

However, the current implementation will produce:
```
1 1 0
```
This sequence is correct in terms of the sum and the number of 1s in the binary representation. But if we consider the input:
```
1
4 2
```
The expected output should be a sequence of 4 non-negative integers that sum to 2 and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. A valid sequence could be `2 0 0 0` or `1 1 0 0`.

The current implementation will produce:
```
1 1 0 0
```
This sequence is correct in terms of the sum and the number of 1s in the binary representation. However, if we consider the input:
```
1
5 1
```
The expected output should be a sequence of 5 non-negative integers that sum to 1 and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. A valid sequence could be `1 0 0 0 0`.

The current implementation will produce:
```
1 0 0 0 0
```
This sequence is correct. However, if we consider the input:
```
1
5 0
```
The expected output should be a sequence of 5 non-negative integers that sum to 0 and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. A valid sequence could be `0 0 0 0 0`.

The current implementation will produce:
```
-1 0 0 0 0
```
This sequence is incorrect because it includes a negative integer, which violates the problem description that all \( a_i \) must be non-negative integers.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
