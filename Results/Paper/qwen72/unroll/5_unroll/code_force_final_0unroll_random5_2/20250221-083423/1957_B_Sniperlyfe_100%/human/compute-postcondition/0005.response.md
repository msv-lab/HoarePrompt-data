The value of `nums[0]` is incremented by `k`. Since `k` is `0`, the value of `nums[0]` remains unchanged. The other elements in the list `nums` are not affected, and `k` remains `0`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the remaining elements are `min(2^(k.bit_length() - 1), k)`, `k` is `0`.**
