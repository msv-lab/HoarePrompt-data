Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.
   - It initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - The first element `nums[0]` is set to the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` (i.e., `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`). This ensures that `nums[0]` has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
   - The remaining sum `k` is reduced by the value of `nums[0]`.
   - The program then iterates through the remaining elements of `nums` and assigns them the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k`. This ensures that the sum condition is maintained while trying to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.
   - Finally, any remaining value of `k` is added to `nums[0]` to ensure the total sum is exactly `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results for each test case and prints them, each on a new line.

This approach ensures that the sequence of integers meets the conditions:
- The sum of the sequence is `k`.
- The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

The program handles all the constraints and edge cases correctly, making it a valid solution for the problem.
