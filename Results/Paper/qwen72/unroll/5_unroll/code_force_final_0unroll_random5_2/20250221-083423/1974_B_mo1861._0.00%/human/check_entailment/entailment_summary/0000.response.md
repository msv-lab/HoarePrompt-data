Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to decode a given string `b` to restore the original string `s`. The decoding process involves creating a mapping from each unique character in `b` to a corresponding character in the auxiliary string `r`, which is constructed by sorting the distinct characters of `b` in alphabetical order and then mapping them symmetrically.

However, there is a critical mistake in the implementation of `func_1`:
- The `char_map` dictionary is created by mapping each unique character in `b` to a character from the end of the alphabet, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to map each unique character in `b` to its symmetric character in the sorted set of unique characters, not to characters from the end of the alphabet.

To correct this, the mapping should be based on the length of the set of unique characters, not the length of the string `b`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {}
    for i, c in enumerate(unique_chars):
        char_map[c] = unique_chars[-(i + 1)]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

Given the original program, the incorrect mapping will produce incorrect results for the test cases. For example, the string "serofedsoc" should be decoded to "codeforces", but the original program will produce a different, incorrect result.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
