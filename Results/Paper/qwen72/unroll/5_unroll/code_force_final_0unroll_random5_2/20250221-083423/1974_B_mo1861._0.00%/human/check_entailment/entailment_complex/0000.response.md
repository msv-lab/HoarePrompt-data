Reasoning:

The given program aims to decode an encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` of distinct characters from `s` in alphabetical order and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`. To decode, the program should reverse this process.

Let's break down the program and its logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `num_chars` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the encoded string `b`.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each unique character in `b` to its symmetric character.
   - The characters in `b` are sorted and then mapped to characters starting from the end of the alphabet. This is incorrect because the mapping should be based on the distinct characters in `b` and their positions in the sorted order, not the length of `b`.

3. **Mapping Characters:**
   - The program correctly iterates over the sorted unique characters in `b` and assigns them to the corresponding symmetric characters.
   - However, the symmetric characters are assigned based on the length of `b` rather than the length of the set of unique characters in `b`.

4. **Constructing the Decoded String:**
   - The program constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped character from `char_map`.

5. **Output:**
   - The decoded string `s` is printed for each test case.

The issue lies in the mapping logic. The correct approach should be to map each unique character in `b` to its symmetric character based on the length of the set of unique characters, not the length of `b`. This is because the length of `b` can be much larger than the number of unique characters, and the symmetric mapping should only consider the distinct characters.

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {}
    for i, c in enumerate(unique_chars):
        char_map[c] = unique_chars[len(unique_chars) - i - 1]
        
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    return s
```

In the original program, the line:
```python
char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
```
should be:
```python
char_map[c] = unique_chars[len(unique_chars) - i - 1]
```

This ensures that the mapping is based on the distinct characters in `b` and their positions in the sorted order.

Given the original program, the mapping logic is incorrect, which leads to incorrect decoding.

Correctness: **False**
