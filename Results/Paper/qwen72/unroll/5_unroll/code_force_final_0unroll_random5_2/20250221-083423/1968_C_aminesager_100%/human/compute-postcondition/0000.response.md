Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x_2, x_3, ..., x_n are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.**

The value of `t` is updated to an integer input by the user, which must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The other variables (`n` and `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`) remain unchanged and still satisfy their initial conditions.
