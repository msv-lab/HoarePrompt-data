### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization of `nums`**:
   - The program initializes `nums` as a list of the first 24 powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^23]`.
   - This list ensures that any sum `v` where `1 ≤ v ≤ 2^24 - 1` can be formed by selecting a subset of these elements (since any number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2).

2. **Finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`**:
   - The program finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` by iterating through the powers of 2 until `k` is less than the next power of 2.
   - This is stored in `1 << idx`, where `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - The program appends `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`. This ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of elements in `nums` because `k` is now split into two parts, one of which is already in `nums` and the other is added.
   - The program appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`. These elements are added to ensure that all sums `v` where `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k` can still be formed.
   - The program removes `1 << idx` from `nums` to prevent `k` from being formed as a sum of elements in `nums`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the modified `nums` list.
   - It then prints the elements of the modified `nums` list.

### Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided counterexample and a few other cases:

#### Counterexample:
- Input: `5 3`
- Expected output: A sequence of length at most 25 where no subsequence sums to 3, and all other sums from 1 to 5 (excluding 3) can be formed.

**Program Output**:
- `nums` is initially `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^23]`.
- `k = 3`, so `1 << idx` is `2` (since `2` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `3`).
- `nums.append(3 - 2) = 1`.
- `nums.append(3 + 1) = 4`.
- `nums.append(3 + 2 + 1) = 6`.
- `nums.remove(2)`.

The final `nums` list is `[1, 1, 4, 4, 6, 8, ..., 2^23]`.

- The length of the sequence is 25, which is within the allowed limit.
- The sequence does not contain a subsequence that sums to 3.
- The sequence can form the sums:
  - Sum 1: `[1]`
  - Sum 2: `[1, 1]`
  - Sum 4: `[4]`
  - Sum 5: `[1, 4]`

This sequence meets the requirements for the input `5 3`.
