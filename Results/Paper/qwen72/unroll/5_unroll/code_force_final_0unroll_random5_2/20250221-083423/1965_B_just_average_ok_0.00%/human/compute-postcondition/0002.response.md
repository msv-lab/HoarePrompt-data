The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraint that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. However, given the constraints, we can infer that the function likely performs some operation involving `n` and `k` and returns a result accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. It returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not described.**
