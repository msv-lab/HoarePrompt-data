You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer, and `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` that represent the indices of a subarray of `c`. The function should determine if each subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. The input constraints are: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` for `i` in `1` to `n` is the cumulative sum of `1` if `a[i] > 1` and `2` otherwise, starting from `b[0] = 0`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` is now a list of cumulative sums of the original `a`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` for `i` in `1` to `n` is the cumulative sum of `1` if the original `a[i] > 1` and `2` otherwise, starting from `b[0] = 0`. The loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an array `c` of length `n` and processes `q` queries. Each query consists of two indices `l_i` and `r_i` that define a subarray of `c`. The function calculates and prints 'YES' if the subarray is "good" based on the condition that the sum of the subarray elements in `c` is not less than the sum of a transformed subarray where each element is either 1 or 2 (1 if the element in `c` is greater than 1, 2 otherwise). If the condition is not met or if `l_i` equals `r_i`, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the subarray are 1. According to the problem description, a subarray is considered good if there exists an array `b` such that the sum of elements in `b` is equal to the sum of elements in the subarray of `c`, and each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in the subarray of `c` and greater than 0. If the subarray consists entirely of 1s, it is impossible to construct such an array `b` because any positive integer different from 1 would change the sum. However, the current program will output "YES" for such subarrays, which is incorrect.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
5 3
1 1 1 1 1
1 5
2 4
3 3
```
Expected output:
```
NO
NO
NO
```
Actual output from the program:
```
YES
YES
NO
```
