Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer, and `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` that represent the indices of a subarray of `c`. The function should determine if each subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. The input constraints are: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
