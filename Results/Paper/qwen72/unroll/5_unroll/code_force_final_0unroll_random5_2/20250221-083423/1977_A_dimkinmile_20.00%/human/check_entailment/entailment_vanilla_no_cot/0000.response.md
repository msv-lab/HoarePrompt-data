Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not consider the parity of the numbers `n` and `m`. Specifically, the program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

For Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the following conditions must be met:
1. `n` must be greater than or equal to `m`.
2. The difference between `n` and `m` must be even, because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the net effect of `n` moves must be an even number of additions or removals to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version checks both conditions and will produce the correct output for the given problem.
