Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.

3. **Logic**:
   - The program checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes in the tower).
   - If `n >= m`, it prints "Yes".
   - If `n < m`, it prints "No".

4. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic is incomplete. The program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - The problem requires that Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, and the tower starts with zero cubes. Therefore, the number of moves `n` must be at least `m` and the difference `n - m` must be even to ensure that the tower can end up with exactly `m` cubes.
   - If `n - m` is odd, it is impossible to achieve the desired number of cubes `m` because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and starting from 0, an odd number of moves will always result in an odd number of cubes, and an even number of moves will always result in an even number of cubes.

5. **Missing Condition**:
   - The program does not check if the difference `n - m` is even, which is a crucial condition for the problem.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is accurate in identifying the missing condition and the incorrectness of the logic.
   - The program is indeed incorrect because it does not account for the parity of `n - m`.

Final: **False**
