The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output conditions are not provided in the example. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters and return a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 500), `n` (an integer between 2 and 100), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9). It returns a result based on these inputs.**
