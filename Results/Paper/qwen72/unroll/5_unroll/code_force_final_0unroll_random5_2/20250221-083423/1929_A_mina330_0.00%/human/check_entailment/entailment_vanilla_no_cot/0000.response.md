Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ntest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting is a crucial step because it allows us to maximize the differences between elements.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Beauty**:
   - The program initializes a variable `kq` to store the sum of the differences.
   - It then iterates over the first half of the sorted array, calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.
   - For each pair `(a[i], a[len(a) - i - 1])`, it adds the difference `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` to `kq`.

4. **Output**:
   - After calculating the maximum beauty for each test case, the program prints the result.

This approach ensures that the maximum possible differences are summed up, which is the goal of maximizing the beauty of the array. The program correctly handles the constraints and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
