Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `ntest` is an input integer. The loop has printed the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a` for each test case.**
