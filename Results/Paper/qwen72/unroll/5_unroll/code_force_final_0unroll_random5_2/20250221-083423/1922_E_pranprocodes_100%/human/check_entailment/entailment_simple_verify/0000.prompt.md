You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max = 100000000
        min = -100000000
        ans = []
        t = 0
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        ans.reverse()
        print(t)
        print(*ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem with a specific input format, but the function definition provided does not include parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the integer `X` for each test case, where `1 <= t <= 1000` and `2 <= X <= 10^18`. The function should handle these inputs to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or return -1 if no such array exists.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the value of `X` for each case, and generates an array `ans` that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or returns -1 if no such array exists. After processing all test cases, the loop finishes, and the final state of the variables `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` will be as follows: `i` will be equal to the number of test cases minus 1, `x` will be 1 (since the loop ensures `x` is reduced to 1), `max` will be the initial value minus the number of even operations performed, `min` will be the initial value plus the number of odd operations performed, `ans` will contain the generated array for the last test case, and `t` will be the number of operations performed to generate the array for the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to correctly generate an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences for certain values of X. For example, consider the input X = 13. The program generates the array `[-100000000, -99999999, 99999999, 99999998, 99999997, 99999996, 99999995]`. However, this array does not have exactly 13 increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences in this array is much larger due to the presence of multiple large positive numbers and negative numbers, which can form many different increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
