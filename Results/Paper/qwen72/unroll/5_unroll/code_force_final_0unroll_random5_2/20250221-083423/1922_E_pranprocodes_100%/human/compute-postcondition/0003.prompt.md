You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem with a specific input format, but the function definition provided does not include parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the integer `X` for each test case, where `1 <= t <= 1000` and `2 <= X <= 10^18`. The function should handle these inputs to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or return -1 if no such array exists.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the value of `X` for each case, and generates an array `ans` that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or returns -1 if no such array exists. After processing all test cases, the loop finishes, and the final state of the variables `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` will be as follows: `i` will be equal to the number of test cases minus 1, `x` will be 1 (since the loop ensures `x` is reduced to 1), `max` will be the initial value minus the number of even operations performed, `min` will be the initial value plus the number of odd operations performed, `ans` will contain the generated array for the last test case, and `t` will be the number of operations performed to generate the array for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `t` and `X`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 1000) and `X` is an integer (2 <= X <= 10^18) for each test case. It returns an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or `-1` if no such array exists.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
