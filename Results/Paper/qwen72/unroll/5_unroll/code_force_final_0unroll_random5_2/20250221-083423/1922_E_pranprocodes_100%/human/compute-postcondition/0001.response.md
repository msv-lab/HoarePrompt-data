Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, reads the value of `X` for each case, and generates an array `ans` that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or returns -1 if no such array exists. After processing all test cases, the loop finishes, and the final state of the variables `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` will be as follows: `i` will be equal to the number of test cases minus 1, `x` will be 1 (since the loop ensures `x` is reduced to 1), `max` will be the initial value minus the number of even operations performed, `min` will be the initial value plus the number of odd operations performed, `ans` will contain the generated array for the last test case, and `t` will be the number of operations performed to generate the array for the last test case.**
