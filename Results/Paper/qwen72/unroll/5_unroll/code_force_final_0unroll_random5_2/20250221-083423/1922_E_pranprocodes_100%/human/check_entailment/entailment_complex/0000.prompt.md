Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem with a specific input format, but the function definition provided does not include parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the integer `X` for each test case, where `1 <= t <= 1000` and `2 <= X <= 10^18`. The function should handle these inputs to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or return -1 if no such array exists.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the value of `X` for each case, and generates an array `ans` that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or returns -1 if no such array exists. After processing all test cases, the loop finishes, and the final state of the variables `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` will be as follows: `i` will be equal to the number of test cases minus 1, `x` will be 1 (since the loop ensures `x` is reduced to 1), `max` will be the initial value minus the number of even operations performed, `min` will be the initial value plus the number of odd operations performed, `ans` will contain the generated array for the last test case, and `t` will be the number of operations performed to generate the array for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads an integer `X`. It then generates an array of integers `ans` of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If such an array can be generated, it prints the length of the array `t` and the array itself. If no such array can be generated, it prints `-1`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state of the program includes the processed test cases and the generated arrays or `-1` for each test case.
