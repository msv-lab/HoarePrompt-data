The function `func` should accept two parameters: `t` for the number of test cases and `X` for the integer in each test case, where `1 <= t <= 1000` and `2 <= X <= 10^18`. The function returns an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or `-1` if no such array exists.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `t` and `X`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 1000) and `X` is an integer (2 <= X <= 10^18) for each test case. It returns an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or `-1` if no such array exists.**
