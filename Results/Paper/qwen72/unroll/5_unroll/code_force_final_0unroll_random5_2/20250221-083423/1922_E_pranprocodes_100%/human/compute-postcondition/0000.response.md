The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which we can consider as `t` (number of test cases). For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will be set by the loop itself, starting from 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
