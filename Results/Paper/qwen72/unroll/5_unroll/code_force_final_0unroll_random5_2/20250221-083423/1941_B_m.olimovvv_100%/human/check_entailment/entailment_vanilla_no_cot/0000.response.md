Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Negative Values**: The program checks if `b[i] < 0` at the beginning of the loop, but it doesn't correctly handle the propagation of negative values. The operations can create negative values in the array, which should be checked after each operation.

2. **Incorrect Update Logic**: The program updates `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` based on `b[i]`, but it doesn't ensure that these updates are valid. Specifically, the values `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` should not become negative during the operations.

3. **Final Check**: The final check only verifies the last two elements of the array, but it should check all elements to ensure they are zero.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be zero or where the array cannot be made zero due to the constraints of the operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize a prefix sum array to keep track of the cumulative effect of operations
        prefix_sum = [0] * n
        
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i] < 2 * prefix_sum[i - 1] or a[i + 1] < prefix_sum[i - 1]:
                print('NO')
                break
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + a[i] // 2
            a[i + 1] -= a[i] // 2
            a[i] %= 2
        else:
            if a[-1] < prefix_sum[-2] or a[-2] < 2 * prefix_sum[-2]:
                print('NO')
            elif a[-1] == 0 and a[-2] == 0 and all(x == 0 for x in a):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Prefix Sum Array**: We use a prefix sum array to keep track of the cumulative effect of the operations. This helps in ensuring that the values at `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` do not become negative.
2. **Operation Logic**: For each index `i` from 1 to `n-2`, we check if the current value `a[i]` can be reduced by `2 * prefix_sum[i - 1]` and if `a[i + 1]` can be reduced by `prefix_sum[i - 1]`. If not, we print 'NO' and break.
3. **Final Check**: After processing all indices, we check if the last two elements and all other elements are zero. If they are, we print 'YES'; otherwise, we print 'NO'.

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles the constraints and checks all necessary conditions to determine if the array can be made zero.
