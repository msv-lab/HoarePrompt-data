You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            a.pop(-1)
            a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]
            cnt += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the same list sorted in non-increasing order. The input list `arr` is not modified, and the function does not have any side effects on other variables or the program state.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected problem difficulties.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems proposed.
   - It also initializes two indices `i` and `j` to 0, which will be used to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through both arrays `a` and `b` simultaneously.
   - The condition `while i < n and j < n` ensures that the loop runs as long as there are elements to compare in both arrays.

4. **Comparison and Insertion**:
   - Inside the loop, the program checks if the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`.
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem is too difficult, so the program:
     - Pops the last element from `a` (the most difficult problem).
     - Inserts `b[j]` into `a` at the correct position to maintain the non-decreasing order.
     - Increments the counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems proposed.
     - Increments `j` to move to the next expected difficulty.
   - If `b[j] >= a[i]`, it means the current problem is within the expected difficulty, so the program:
     - Increments both `i` and `j` to move to the next problem in both arrays.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints the counter `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of new problems needed.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. It sorts an array in descending order, which is not relevant to the problem.

7. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies when a problem is too difficult and proposes a new problem with the appropriate difficulty.
   - The insertion and popping operations ensure that the array `a` remains sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The loop continues until all problems are within the expected difficulty.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `a` and `b` are already in the correct order (no new problems needed).
   - It also handles the case where `a` is more difficult than `b` for some elements, requiring the insertion of new problems.

9. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) because the operations inside the loop are linear in complexity.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
