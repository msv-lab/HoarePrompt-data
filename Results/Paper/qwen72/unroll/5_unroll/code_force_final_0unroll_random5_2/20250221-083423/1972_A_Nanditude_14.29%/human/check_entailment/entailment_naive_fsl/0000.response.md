Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the program does not always ensure that the array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order after each insertion and deletion operation. This can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of the Failure:**
1. The program starts with `a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]` and `b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]`.
2. The first iteration finds `b[0] = 800` which is less than `a[0] = 1000`. It pops the last element of `a` (2700) and inserts 800 at the beginning, resulting in `a = [800, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200]`.
3. The second iteration finds `b[1] = 1200` which is less than `a[1] = 1400`. It pops the last element of `a` (2200) and inserts 1200 at the second position, resulting in `a = [800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 2000, 2000]`.
4. The third iteration finds `b[2] = 1500` which is less than `a[2] = 1400`. It pops the last element of `a` (2000) and inserts 1500 at the third position, resulting in `a = [800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1500, 2000]`.

At this point, the program has performed 3 operations, but it should have only performed 2 operations to achieve the goal. The correct sequence of operations should be:

1. Insert 800 and remove 2700, resulting in `a = [800, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200]`.
2. Insert 1800 and remove 2200, resulting in `a = [800, 1000, 1400, 1800, 2000, 2000]`.

The program fails to correctly handle the insertion and sorting of the array `a` after each operation, leading to an incorrect result.
