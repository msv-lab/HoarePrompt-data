Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the exponents of the lengths of sticks (2^a_i). The function calculates and prints the number of ways to choose three sticks that can form a triangle for each test case. If `n` is less than 3, the function prints 0 for that test case. The `buffer` list remains empty throughout the execution, and the function does not return any value. **
