### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes a counter `good_subarrays` to keep track of the number of good subarrays.
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in `b` and the first subarray of length `m` in `a`.
   - It calculates the initial number of matches between the elements of the first subarray and `b` by summing the minimum of the frequencies of each element present in both counters.
   - It then iterates through the array `a` to slide the window of length `m` one element at a time.
   - For each new position of the window:
     - It checks if the current number of matches is greater than or equal to `k` and increments `good_subarrays` if so.
     - It updates the frequency counter `window_freq` and the number of matches as the window slides.
     - It correctly handles the removal of the element that is sliding out of the window and the addition of the new element that is sliding into the window.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints provided in the problem description, such as the limits on `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It correctly processes the edge cases where `m` is equal to `n` and where `k` is equal to `m`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subarrays.
   - The use of `Counter` ensures that the frequency of elements is correctly managed and updated as the window slides.
   - The logic for updating the number of matches is correct and ensures that the count is maintained accurately.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of good subarrays for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the algorithm is efficient and accurate for the given constraints.

### Correctness:
