The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `a`, `b`, `k`, `n`, and `m`. 

- `a` is a list of integers with a length `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and each element `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^6`.
- `b` is a list of integers with a length `m` where `1 <= m <= n` and each element `b_i` satisfies `1 <= b_i <= 10^6`.
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k <= m`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of list `a`.
- `m` is a non-negative integer representing the length of list `b` and the length of the subarrays to be considered in `a`.

The function returns the number of good subarrays. A good subarray is defined as a subarray of length `m` in list `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer present in both the subarray's frequency distribution (`window_freq`) and the frequency distribution of list `b` (`b_freq`) is greater than or equal to `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers, a list `b` of integers, and three integers `k`, `n`, and `m`. It returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer present in both the subarray and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
