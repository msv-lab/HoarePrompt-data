Output State: **The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed the optimal position `left` or `right` where the number of residents on each side is as balanced as possible. The variables `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `left`, `leftMove`, and `right` will have been reset or modified for each test case, but their final values will be the result of the last test case processed. The input variables `t`, `n`, and `s` will remain unchanged as they are read from input for each test case.**
