The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The function also accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4) representing the number of test cases. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.

The function returns the number of houses that need to be built on the left side and the number of houses that need to be built on the right side for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns the number of houses that need to be built on the left side and the number of houses that need to be built on the right side for each test case.**
