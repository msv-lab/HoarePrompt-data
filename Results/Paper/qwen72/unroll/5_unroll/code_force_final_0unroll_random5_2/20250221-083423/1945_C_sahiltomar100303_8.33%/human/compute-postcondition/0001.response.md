For the given task, the only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the input integer `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop execution.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
