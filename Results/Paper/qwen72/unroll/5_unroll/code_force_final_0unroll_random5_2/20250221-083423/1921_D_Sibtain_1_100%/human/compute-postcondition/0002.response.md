The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. The constraints are as follows: `1 ≤ t ≤ 100` for the number of test cases, `1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5` for the integers `n` and `m`, `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for the elements in list `a_i`, and `1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9` for the elements in list `b_i`. The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed `2 · 10^5`.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`. However, the specific output for each case is not provided in the example, so we can only describe the general functionality based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The exact nature of the result is not specified, but it is based on the values of `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` within the given constraints.**
