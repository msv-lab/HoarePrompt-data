### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the lengths of the arrays `a` and `c`, respectively.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `c`.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If all elements in `a` and `c` are the same, the function prints 0 and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the total difference `D` will be 0 if both arrays are identical.

3. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - The function sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order. This is a good strategy because it maximizes the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two arrays.

4. **Single Element Handling:**
   - If `a` has only one element, the function calculates the maximum absolute difference between that element and any element in `c` and prints it. This is correct because the maximum difference is achieved by choosing the largest or smallest element in `c`.

5. **General Case Handling:**
   - For the general case where `a` has more than one element, the function initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to 0 and 1, respectively, and an answer variable `ans` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the elements of `a` and calculates the absolute differences between the current element of `a` and the corresponding elements of `c` using the pointers.
   - It updates the pointers based on which difference is larger and adds the larger difference to `ans`.
   - This approach ensures that the function is always choosing the largest possible difference at each step, which is a greedy strategy to maximize the total difference `D`.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total difference `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle all the given test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement. The special cases are handled appropriately, and the general case uses a greedy approach to maximize the total difference `D`.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
