### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the balanced shuffle of a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves computing the prefix balance for each character, sorting the characters based on the prefix balance (and position in case of ties), and then constructing the new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input is a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The output should be the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input string `n`.
   - It defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` and returns its balanced shuffle.
   - Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `d` is used to store the prefix balance at each position.
   - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0` to represent the balance before the first character.
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the prefix balance in the dictionary `d`.
   - After the loop, the last entry in the dictionary (which corresponds to the balance after the last character) is removed using `d.pop(n)`.
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted based on the prefix balance (first key in the tuple) and in decreasing order of position (second key in the tuple).
   - The sorted characters are concatenated to form the result string `ans`.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Prefix Balance Calculation:**
     - The prefix balance is correctly calculated by incrementing or decrementing the balance based on whether the character is an opening or closing parenthesis.
   - **Dictionary Management:**
     - The dictionary `d` is correctly updated to store the prefix balance at each position.
     - The last entry is removed to avoid including the balance after the last character.
   - **Sorting:**
     - The dictionary is sorted using the `sorted` function with a custom key. The key is a tuple where the first element is the prefix balance and the second element is the negative position to ensure decreasing order of positions.
   - **Constructing the Result:**
     - The sorted characters are concatenated to form the result string `ans`.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Initial Balance:**
     - The initial balance `d[0] = 0` is correctly set.
   - **Prefix Balance Update:**
     - The prefix balance is correctly updated for each character.
   - **Dictionary Removal:**
     - The last entry is correctly removed from the dictionary.
   - **Sorting:**
     - The sorting logic is correct, ensuring that the prefix balance is the primary key and the position is the secondary key in decreasing order.
   - **Character Concatenation:**
     - The characters are correctly concatenated to form the result string.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case of a single-character string (either "(" or ")") correctly.
   - The program also handles the case of an empty string, although the problem guarantees that the input string is non-empty.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. It correctly calculates the prefix balance, sorts the characters based on the specified criteria, and constructs the result string.

**Correctness: True**
