Output State: **`ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` in the order determined by the sorted list `d`, which is based on the difference between the number of "(" and ")" characters in the substrings of `s` in ascending order, and by the index in descending order if the differences are the same. The length of `ans` is the same as the length of `s`. The variables `s`, `n`, and `d` remain unchanged.**
