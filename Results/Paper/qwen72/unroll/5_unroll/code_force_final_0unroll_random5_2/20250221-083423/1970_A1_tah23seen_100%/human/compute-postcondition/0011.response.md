The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns a string `ans` which contains the characters from `s` rearranged according to the sorted list `d`. The list `d` is sorted based on the difference between the number of "(" and ")" characters in the substrings of `s` in ascending order, and by the index in descending order if the differences are the same. The length of `ans` is the same as the length of `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `ans` where the characters are rearranged based on the sorted substrings of `s`. The substrings are sorted by the difference between the number of "(" and ")" characters in ascending order, and by their starting index in descending order if the differences are the same. The length of `ans` is the same as the length of `s`.**
