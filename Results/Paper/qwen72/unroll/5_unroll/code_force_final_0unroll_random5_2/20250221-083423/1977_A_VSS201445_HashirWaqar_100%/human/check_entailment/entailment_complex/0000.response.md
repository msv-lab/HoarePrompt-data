### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` is used to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - **Explanation of the Condition**:
     - `n >= m`: This ensures that the number of moves is at least as many as the number of cubes required. If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even. This is because each move can either add or remove a cube, and to end up with exactly `m` cubes, the number of additions and removals must balance out in such a way that the difference is even.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, and 'NO' otherwise.
   - The output is case-insensitive, so 'YES' and 'NO' are acceptable as per the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge cases where `n` and `m` are both 1.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is greater than `m` but the difference is odd, which correctly results in 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, and it handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
