### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case:**
   - The condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` checks two things:
     - `n >= m`: This ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the desired number of cubes `m`. This is necessary because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, and he needs at least `m` moves to have `m` cubes.
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` is even. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the net effect of an even number of moves (after reaching `m` cubes) will be zero (i.e., the tower will still have `m` cubes).

3. **Output:**
   - If both conditions are met, the function prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is exactly `m` (which is a valid scenario).
   - It also handles the case where `n` is greater than `m` but the difference is odd, which is an invalid scenario.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the first test case (`3 3`), `n = 3` and `m = 3`. The condition `n >= m` is true, and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is true. Therefore, the output is 'YES'.
   - For the second test case (`2 4`), `n = 2` and `m = 4`. The condition `n >= m` is false, so the output is 'NO'.
   - For the third test case (`5 3`), `n = 5` and `m = 3`. The condition `n >= m` is true, and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is true. Therefore, the output is 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions and the output are consistent with the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
