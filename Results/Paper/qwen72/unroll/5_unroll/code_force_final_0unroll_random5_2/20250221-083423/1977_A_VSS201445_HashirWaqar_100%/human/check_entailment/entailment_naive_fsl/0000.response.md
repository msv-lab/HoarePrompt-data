Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is incorrect. The correct condition should be whether `n` and `m` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the parity of the number of cubes in the tower will only change if the number of moves is odd. 

For example, consider the test case `n = 3` and `m = 2`:
- After 3 moves, the number of cubes in the tower can only be 1, 3, or 5 (all odd numbers).
- The program will incorrectly output "NO" because `(3 - 2) % 2 == 1`, but the correct answer should be "Yes" because it is possible to have 2 cubes after 3 moves (e.g., put, put, remove).

The correct condition should be:
```python
if n >= m and n % 2 == m % 2:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
