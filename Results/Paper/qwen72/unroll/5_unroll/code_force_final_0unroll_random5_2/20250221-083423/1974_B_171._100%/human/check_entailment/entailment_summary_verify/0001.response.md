### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases and ensures that the input is read in a single operation.
   - It then iterates through the list to parse the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded strings `b`.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to decode the string and appends the result to the `results` list.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters in the string `b` using `sorted(set(encoded))`. This step is crucial because it ensures that the characters are in alphabetical order, which is required for the symmetric mapping.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each character in the sorted list to its symmetric character. This is done by iterating over the list of unique characters and pairing each character with its reverse position in the list.
   - Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`. This is done using a generator expression inside the `join` method, which efficiently constructs the decoded string.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each decoded string.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Unique Characters and Sorting:**
  - The program correctly identifies and sorts the unique characters in the encoded string `b`. This is essential for creating the symmetric mapping. The use of `set` ensures that only unique characters are considered, and `sorted` ensures they are in alphabetical order.

- **Symmetric Mapping:**
  - The program creates a symmetric mapping by pairing the first character with the last, the second with the second last, and so on. This is done using a dictionary `char_map` and is consistent with the problem's requirements.

- **Decoding:**
  - The program decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`. This is done using a generator expression inside the `join` method, which is an efficient way to construct the decoded string.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles single-character strings correctly. For example, if the encoded string is "w", the unique characters list will be ["w"], and the mapping will be `{"w": "w"}`, resulting in the correct output "w".
  - It also handles strings with repeated characters correctly. For example, if the encoded string is "ttf", the unique characters list will be ["f", "t"], and the mapping will be `{"f": "t", "t": "f"}`, resulting in the correct output "fft".
  - The program handles the case where the encoded string has all unique characters. For example, if the encoded string is "algorithm", the unique characters list will be ["a", "g", "h", "i", "l", "m", "o", "r", "t"], and the mapping will be `{"a": "t", "g": "r", "h": "o", "i": "m", "l": "l", "m": "i", "o": "h", "r": "g", "t": "a"}`, resulting in the correct output "algorithm".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct decoded strings. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`, and the original assessment is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
