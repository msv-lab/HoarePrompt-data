The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len_unique`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `len_unique`. If `len_unique` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, `len_unique` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
