Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly follows the problem description for decoding the string. It constructs the auxiliary string `r` from the unique characters of the input string `b`, sorted in alphabetical order. It then creates a mapping where each character in `b` is replaced by its symmetric character from `r`. The program handles the input and output format as specified, and it processes multiple test cases correctly. I have not found any edge cases or potential inputs where the program fails to produce the correct decoded string.
