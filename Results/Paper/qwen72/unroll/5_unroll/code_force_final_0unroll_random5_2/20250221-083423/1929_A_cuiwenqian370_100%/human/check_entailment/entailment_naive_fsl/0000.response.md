Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the maximum beauty of the array. According to the problem description, the beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, in the `func_1` function, the beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach is incorrect because the problem does not specify the use of absolute differences. Instead, the correct approach would be to sort the array in descending order and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which would maximize the positive differences.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `3\n3\n1 2 3`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `2`

However, for a different input:
- Input: `3\n3\n3 2 1`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `2`

The program gives the correct output for these specific inputs, but it does not follow the problem description for the general case. The correct approach should be to sort the array in descending order and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
