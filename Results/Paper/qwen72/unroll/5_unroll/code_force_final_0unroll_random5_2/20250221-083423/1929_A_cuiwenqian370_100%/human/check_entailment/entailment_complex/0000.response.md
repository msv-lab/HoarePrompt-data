Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, where the beauty is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The elements of the array can be rearranged in any way to maximize this beauty.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Sorting**: The function sorts the array in ascending order. Sorting the array is a valid approach because the maximum beauty is achieved when the elements are as far apart as possible in consecutive positions.
   - **Beauty Calculation**: The function then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This is correct because the absolute difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array is always non-negative and maximizes the difference between the smallest and largest elements.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated beauty, which is the sum of the absolute differences.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Reading**: The function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to handle multiple test cases. It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - **Array Processing**: For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array, and then calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty.
   - **Result Storage and Output**: The results of each test case are stored in a list `results`, and after processing all test cases, the function prints each result.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where all elements in the array are the same (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`), correctly returning a beauty of 0.
   - The function also handles the case where the array has only two elements, correctly calculating the beauty as the absolute difference between the two elements.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The approach of sorting the array and calculating the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements is mathematically sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.
   - The input and output handling in `func_2` is correct and follows the problem's constraints and format.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
