Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, where the beauty is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_i-1)` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

### Function 1: `func_1(array)`
1. **Sorting the Array**: The function sorts the array `array` in ascending order. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which is not the optimal approach for maximizing the beauty. However, the problem's definition of beauty is the sum of `(a_i - a_i-1)`, and sorting the array in ascending order will indeed maximize the sum of these differences.
2. **Calculating the Beauty**: The function iterates through the sorted array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. The use of `abs` is unnecessary because the array is sorted, and the differences will always be non-negative.
3. **Returning the Beauty**: The function returns the calculated beauty.

### Function 2: `func_2()`
1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings `data`.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: It processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the array elements from `data`.
3. **Calling `func_1`**: For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the array and appends the result to the `results` list.
4. **Outputting Results**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

### Issues:
- **Sorting and Absolute Differences**: The function `func_1` sorts the array and calculates the sum of absolute differences, which is correct for the given problem definition. However, the use of `abs` is redundant since the array is already sorted.
- **Input Handling**: The input handling in `func_2` is correct and follows the problem's input format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements. The use of `abs` in `func_1` is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
