### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` from the input, and then reads the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - The indices `f` and `k` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to align with Python's 0-based indexing.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`. This ensures that the cubes are arranged from the largest value to the smallest value.

3. **Favorite Cube Value**:
   - The value of the favorite cube `x` is stored before sorting. This is necessary because the position of the favorite cube might change after sorting.

4. **Comparison**:
   - The function checks if the value of the favorite cube `x` is less than, greater than, or equal to the value of the `k`-th cube in the sorted list.
   - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes, so it will not be removed. The function prints "NO".
   - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes, so it will be removed. The function prints "YES".
   - If `a[k] == x`, the favorite cube might be among the first `k` cubes, depending on the values of the other cubes. The function further checks:
     - If `k == n - 1` or `a[k - 1] < x`, the favorite cube is the last cube in the sorted list or it is the only cube with that value among the first `k` cubes, so it will be removed. The function prints "YES".
     - Otherwise, the function prints "MAYBE" because the favorite cube could be in any position among the cubes with the same value, and it might or might not be removed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is 0 or `n - 1`.
   - The function also correctly handles cases where the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes.

6. **Final State**:
   - The variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are not retained after each iteration, which is expected as each test case is independent.
   - The list `a` is sorted in descending order after each test case, and the values of `n`, `f`, and `k` are the last input values for these variables.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the favorite cube will be removed based on the problem description. It handles all the given test cases and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
