You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, it checks if, for every index `i` (0 ≤ i < n), either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `c[i]`. If this condition is met for all indices, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the value of `l` will be 'NO' if any test case did not meet the condition, and `t` will remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If this condition holds for all positions, it sets `l` to 'YES'.
   - If the condition fails for any position, it sets `l` to 'NO'.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, the program prints the value of `l`.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic:
- The program sets `l` to 'YES' if any position satisfies the condition, but it should only set `l` to 'YES' if **all** positions satisfy the condition.
- The program sets `l` to 'NO' after the loop, which is incorrect because it should set `l` to 'NO' if **any** position fails the condition.

To fix this, we need to initialize `l` to 'YES' at the beginning of each test case and set it to 'NO' as soon as we find a position that fails the condition.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        l = 'YES'
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]:
                l = 'NO'
                break
        print(l)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**: `l` is initialized to 'YES' at the start of each test case.
- **Loop**: The loop checks each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
  - If `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `c[i]`, it sets `l` to 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
- **Output**: After the loop, it prints the value of `l`.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning and the corrected program, the original program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the condition for all positions.

Correctness: **False**
