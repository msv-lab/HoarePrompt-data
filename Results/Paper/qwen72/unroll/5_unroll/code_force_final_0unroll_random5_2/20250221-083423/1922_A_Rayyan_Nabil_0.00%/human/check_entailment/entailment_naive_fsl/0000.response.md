Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the template for each test case. The program sets `l = 'YES'` if for any position `i` in the strings, `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. However, this logic is flawed because it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
The program will output "YES" because for each position `i`, `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. However, there is no template that can be constructed where `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. This is because `a`, `b`, and `c` all have different characters at each position, making it impossible to construct a template that satisfies the conditions for `a` and `b` but fails for `c`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
