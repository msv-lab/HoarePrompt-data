Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, it checks if, for every index `i` (0 â‰¤ i < n), either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `c[i]`. If this condition is met for all indices, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the value of `l` will be 'NO' if any test case did not meet the condition, and `t` will remain unchanged. **
