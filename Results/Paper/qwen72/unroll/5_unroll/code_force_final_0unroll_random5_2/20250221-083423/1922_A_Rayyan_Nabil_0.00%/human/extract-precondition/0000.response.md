Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) represents the number of test cases.**
