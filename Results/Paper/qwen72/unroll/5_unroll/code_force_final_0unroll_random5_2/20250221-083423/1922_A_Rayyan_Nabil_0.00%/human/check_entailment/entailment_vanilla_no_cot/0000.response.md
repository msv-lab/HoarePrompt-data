Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not properly check if a template can be constructed such that both `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not. Specifically, the program only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for each position `i`, but it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the same template.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        # Initialize the template with lowercase letters
        template = [a[i] if a[i] == b[i] else 'x' for i in range(n)]
        
        # Check if a and b can match the template
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != b[i]:
                if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                    template[i] = 'X'  # Use uppercase to indicate a mismatch for c
                else:
                    template[i] = a[i]  # Choose one of a[i] or b[i] to match the template
        
        # Check if c does not match the template
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i] == 'X':
                continue
            if template[i].islower() and template[i] != c[i]:
                continue
            if template[i].isupper() and template[i].lower() == c[i]:
                continue
            print("NO")
            break
        else:
            print("YES")

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Template Initialization**: The template is initialized with lowercase letters. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` is set to that letter. If they are different, the template is set to a placeholder `'x'`.

2. **Template Matching for `a` and `b`**: For each position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template is set to an uppercase letter `'X'` if `c[i]` matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, it is set to one of the lowercase letters from `a` or `b`.

3. **Template Mismatch for `c`**: The program then checks if `c` does not match the template. If `c[i]` matches the template at any position, the program prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without finding a match, the program prints "YES".

This corrected version ensures that the template is correctly constructed and that the conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` are properly checked.
