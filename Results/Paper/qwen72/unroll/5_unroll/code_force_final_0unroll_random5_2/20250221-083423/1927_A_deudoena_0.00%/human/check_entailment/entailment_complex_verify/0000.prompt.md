You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B'.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` when counting from the end, `outind` is 0.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: - The print statement will output the result of the expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a string `inpstr` from the user input. It then finds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` (from the beginning) and the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` (from the end). The function prints the difference between the length of `inpstr` and the sum of these two indices. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input format correctly as specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the input will consist of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` followed by a string `s` of length `n`. However, the provided program only reads a single string and does not account for the number of test cases or the length of the strip. This means the program will fail to process the input correctly for the given format.

Additionally, the logic for finding the minimum length of the segment to be painted is flawed. The program calculates the indices of the first and last 'B' characters and then prints the length of the segment between them. This approach does not always yield the correct minimum length, especially when there are multiple segments of black cells that need to be considered.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
WBBWBW
```
The program will output `4`, which is correct for this specific case. However, for the input:
```
1
4
BWWB
```
The program will output `2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because painting the segment from the 1st to the 1st cell (or the 4th to the 4th cell) is sufficient to make the entire strip white.
