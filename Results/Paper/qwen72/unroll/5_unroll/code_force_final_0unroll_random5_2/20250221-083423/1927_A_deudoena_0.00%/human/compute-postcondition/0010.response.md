Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` when counting from the end.
   - `outind` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
   ```

3. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr` when counting from the end. This is equivalent to the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr` when counting from the beginning.
   - `len(inpstr)` is the length of the string `inpstr`.

4. **Calculation:**
   - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` calculates the difference between the length of the string and the sum of the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B'.

5. **Example:**
   - Suppose `inpstr = "AABBBCC"`.
     - `ind1` (index of the first 'B') is 2.
     - `ind2` (index of the last 'B') is 4.
     - `len(inpstr)` is 7.
   - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` becomes `7 - 4 - 2 = 1`.

6. **General Case:**
   - For any string `inpstr` with 'B' characters, `ind1` and `ind2` will be the indices of the first and last 'B' respectively.
   - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` will always yield a value that represents the number of characters in the string excluding the first and last 'B' occurrences.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the result of the expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.

Output: **len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 (where `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr`, and `len(inpstr)` is the length of the string `inpstr`)**
