### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The annotated code confirms that the input handling is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Determine `k`**:
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is the number of buns to be sold at the modified price.
   - The logic behind `k = min(n, b - a)` is to ensure that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and that the modified price sequence does not go below the usual price `a`.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The annotated code confirms that `k` is calculated correctly and is used appropriately in the subsequent calculations.

3. **Check if `b <= a`**:
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it means the modified price sequence will not provide any additional profit compared to selling all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - In this case, the program correctly prints `a * n`, which is the total profit from selling all buns at the usual price.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The annotated code confirms that the program correctly handles this case and prints the expected result.

4. **Calculate Profit for `b > a`**:
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, the program calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The annotated code confirms that the profit calculation for the modified price buns is correct and follows the arithmetic series formula. The profit from the remaining buns is also calculated correctly.

5. **Arithmetic Series Formula**:
   - The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` is used to calculate the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the common difference is `-1`.
   - This formula is correct and efficiently calculates the sum of the modified prices.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The annotated code confirms that the arithmetic series formula is applied correctly.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `b <= a` correctly by selling all buns at the usual price.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is 0, which means no buns are sold at the modified price, and all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The annotated code confirms that the program handles these edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns, considering the promotion and the usual price. The arithmetic series formula is used correctly, and the program handles all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
