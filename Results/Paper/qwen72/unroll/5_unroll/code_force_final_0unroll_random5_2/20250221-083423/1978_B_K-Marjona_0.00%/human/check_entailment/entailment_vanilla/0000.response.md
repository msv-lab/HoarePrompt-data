### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Determine `k`**:
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is the number of buns to be sold at the modified price.
   - The logic behind `k = min(n, b - a)` is to ensure that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and that the modified price sequence does not go below the usual price `a`.

3. **Check if `b <= a`**:
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it means the modified price sequence will not provide any additional profit compared to selling all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - In this case, the program correctly prints `a * n`, which is the total profit from selling all buns at the usual price.

4. **Calculate Profit for `b > a`**:
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, the program calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

5. **Arithmetic Series Formula**:
   - The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` is used to calculate the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the common difference is `-1`.
   - This formula is correct and efficiently calculates the sum of the modified prices.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `b <= a` correctly by selling all buns at the usual price.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is 0, which means no buns are sold at the modified price, and all buns are sold at the usual price.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns, considering the promotion and the usual price. The arithmetic series formula is used correctly, and the program handles all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
