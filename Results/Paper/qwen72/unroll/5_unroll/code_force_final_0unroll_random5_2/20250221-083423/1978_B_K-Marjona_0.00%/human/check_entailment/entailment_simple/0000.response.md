Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of calculating the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns, where the first k buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining buns are sold at the usual price. The program uses a loop to handle multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the optimal value of k and then computes the profit accordingly.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case.
2. **Optimal k Calculation**: The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is correct because:
   - If `b <= a`, it is better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price would not be higher.
   - If `b > a`, the maximum value of `k` should be the minimum of `n` and `b - a` to ensure that the modified price is always greater than or equal to `a`.
3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, the profit is simply `a * n` because selling all buns at the usual price is the best option.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is calculated as `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series for the first `k` buns sold at modified prices, plus the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.
     - The sum of the first `k` buns sold at modified prices is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1))\).
     - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

The program's logic and calculations are correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
