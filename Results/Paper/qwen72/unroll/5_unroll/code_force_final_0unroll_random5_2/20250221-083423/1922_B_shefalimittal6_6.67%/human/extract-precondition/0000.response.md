Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) for a test case, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

However, the provided function definition `def func():` does not match the problem description. It should be updated to accept the required parameters. Here is a corrected function definition:

```
def func(t, test_cases):
```

With this, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) for a test case, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
