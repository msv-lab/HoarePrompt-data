Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from a given set of sticks, such that the chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. The lengths of the sticks are given as powers of 2, i.e., \(2^{a_i}\).

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Triangle Inequality Theorem**:
   - For three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
   - Given the stick lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a triangle is if at least two of the sticks have the same length. This is because \(2^a + 2^b > 2^c\) is only possible if \(a = b\) and \(c\) is the same or a smaller power of 2.

2. **Counting Valid Triplets**:
   - The program counts the number of valid triplets by:
     - Counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length.
     - Counting the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - **Input Reading**:
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of powers `nums`.
   - **Counting Stick Lengths**:
     - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - **Calculating Valid Triplets**:
     - For each stick length count `cnt`:
       - If `cnt` is 3 or more, it adds the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
       - If `cnt` is 2 or more, it adds the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of the counts of all other stick lengths.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where there are fewer than 3 sticks correctly by not adding any triplets.
   - It also handles the case where all sticks have the same length by using the combination formula to count all possible triplets.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of valid triplets.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid triplets of sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
