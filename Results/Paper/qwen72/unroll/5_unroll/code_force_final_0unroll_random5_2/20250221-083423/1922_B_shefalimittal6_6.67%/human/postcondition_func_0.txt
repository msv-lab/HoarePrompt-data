The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the number of valid triplets of indices (i, j, k) such that the elements at these indices are the same or two of them are the same and the third is different. The function prints the result for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has printed the value of `res` for each of the `t` test cases. The variables `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `res`, `cnt`, `total_sum`, and `x` are reset for each iteration of the loop, and their final values after the loop completes are undefined.
