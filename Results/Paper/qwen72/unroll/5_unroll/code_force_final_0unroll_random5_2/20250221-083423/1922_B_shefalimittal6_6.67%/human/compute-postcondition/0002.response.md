Output State: **The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has printed the value of `res` for each of the `t` test cases. The variables `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `res`, `cnt`, `total_sum`, and `x` are reset for each iteration of the loop, and their final values after the loop completes are undefined (as they are local to each iteration).**
