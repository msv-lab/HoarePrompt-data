### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2` reads the integers `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3` reads the permutation `p` for each test case.
   - These functions are correctly implemented to handle the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search is performed on the permutation `p` with initial values `left = 0` and `right = n`.
   - The loop continues until `right - left = 1`.
   - The middle index `mid` is calculated as `left + (right - left) // 2`.
   - The element at `p[mid]` is compared with `x` to adjust `left` or `right`.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - If `p[left] == x`, no swaps are needed, and the program prints `0`.
   - If `x` is not seen in the `seen` list, one swap is performed to place `x` at the correct position.
   - If `x` is seen but not at the correct position, two swaps are performed to place `x` correctly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position but can be placed with one or two swaps.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The binary search is correctly implemented, but it is applied to an unsorted permutation.
   - The program correctly identifies the need for swaps and performs them to ensure `p[left] == x` after the binary search.
   - The number of swaps is limited to 2, as required by the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem's requirements and handles the input and output as specified. The binary search is applied to the permutation, and the necessary swaps are performed to ensure the correct result. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
