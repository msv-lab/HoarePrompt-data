### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It correctly returns an integer value, which is expected for the number of test cases.
   - **Correct**.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the integers `n` and `x` from the input.
   - It correctly returns a map object that converts each element of the input (split by spaces) into an integer.
   - **Correct**.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the permutation `p` from the input.
   - It correctly returns a list of integers that were input by the user, separated by spaces.
   - **Correct**.

4. **Main Algorithm**:
   - The main algorithm initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to `n`.
   - It uses a binary search-like loop to find the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - The loop continues until `right - left` is 1, which is the correct termination condition for binary search.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and updates the `seen` array to mark the elements that have been considered.
   - If `p[mid]` is less than or equal to `x`, it updates `left` to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `right` to `mid`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `p[left]` is equal to `x`. If so, it prints 0 (no swaps needed).
   - If `x` is not in the `seen` array, it prints 1 and the swap operation to move `x` to the correct position.
   - If `x` is in the `seen` array but not at the correct position, it prints 2 and the necessary swap operations to move `x` to the correct position.
   - The logic for determining the number of swaps and the indices to swap is correct based on the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position but can be moved with one swap.
   - Finally, it handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position and requires two swaps to be moved.

6. **Input/Output**:
   - The program reads the input correctly and processes it as described in the problem.
   - The output format is correct, matching the expected output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the cases described in the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
