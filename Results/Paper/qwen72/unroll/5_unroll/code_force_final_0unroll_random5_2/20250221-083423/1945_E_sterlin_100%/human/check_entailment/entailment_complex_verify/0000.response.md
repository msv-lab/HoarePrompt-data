Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in stating that the provided program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Input Reading Functions**:
   - `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are indeed just placeholders for reading input. They do not perform any of the core logic required to solve the problem.
   - These functions are used to read the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, and the permutation itself. However, they do not handle the binary search or the necessary swaps.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the program attempts to perform a binary search on the permutation `p` and determine the number of swaps needed to place the target `x` in the correct position.
   - However, the binary search logic is flawed:
     - The initial values for `left` and `right` are set to `0` and `n`, respectively. This is incorrect because the problem description specifies that `l` should be `1` and `r` should be `n + 1`.
     - The binary search loop condition `while left + 1 < right` is also incorrect. It should be `while right - left > 1` to match the problem description.
     - The `seen` array is used to track which elements have been visited, but this is not necessary for the binary search algorithm. The binary search should only focus on finding the position of `x` in the sorted segment of the permutation.
     - The logic for determining the number of swaps and the indices to swap is not correctly implemented. The program does not ensure that the permutation is rearranged correctly before performing the binary search.

3. **Output**:
   - The program does not handle the output as specified in the problem description. It should output the number of swaps and the indices for each swap, but the current logic is incorrect and does not produce the correct output for all cases.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
