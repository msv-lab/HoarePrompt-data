The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= start <= end, and the current directory contains subfolders with names that can be interpreted as integers. The function returns a list of subfolder names that are integers and fall within the range `[start, end]`.

Functionality: **The function returns a list of subfolder names in the current directory that are integers and fall within the specified range `[start, end]`, where `start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= start <= end.**
