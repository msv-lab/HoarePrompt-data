### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the `i`-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the `i`-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)` for all `i`.
   - The condition to satisfy is: `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - For each `i`, the condition can be rewritten as: `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i`.
   - This can be rearranged to: `sum(x_i) - x_i < k_i * x_i - x_i`.
   - Simplifying, we get: `sum(x_i) < x_i * (k_i - 1)`.
   - Therefore, `x_i > sum(x_i) / (k_i - 1)`.

3. **Solution Approach:**
   - We need to find a set of `x_i` values that satisfy the above condition for all `i`.
   - One way to do this is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the values `(k_i - 1)` for all `i`. This ensures that the `x_i` values are large enough to satisfy the condition.
   - If the LCM is too large, it may not be possible to find such `x_i` values that are within the constraints (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function calculates the LCM of two numbers. The LCM is calculated using the formula `lcm(a, b) = abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.
   - **Main Logic:**
     - For each test case, the program calculates the LCM of the list `(k_i - 1)`.
     - If the LCM is greater than `10^9`, it outputs `-1` because it is not possible to find suitable `x_i` values.
     - Otherwise, it outputs the LCM divided by `(k_i - 1)` for each `i`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly calculates the LCM of the list `(k_i - 1)`.
   - The program checks if the LCM is within the constraints and outputs the appropriate values or `-1` if it is not possible.
   - The program ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
