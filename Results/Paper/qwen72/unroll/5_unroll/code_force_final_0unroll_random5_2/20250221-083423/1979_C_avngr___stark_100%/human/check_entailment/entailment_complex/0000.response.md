### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, the amount received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`, and we need `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a, b)`:** This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both `a` and `b`.
   - **`func_2(numbers)`:** This function calculates the LCM of a list of integers `numbers`. It does this by iteratively applying `func_1` to the elements of the list.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k` for all outcomes.
   - It then distributes the coins such that the bet on each outcome `i` is `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM of the multipliers.
   - The program checks if the total amount bet `sum(c)` is less than `m`. If it is, the solution is valid; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - **LCM Calculation:** The LCM of the multipliers `k` is calculated correctly using `func_2`.
   - **Bet Distribution:** The bets are distributed as `m // k[i]`, which ensures that the amount received back for any winning outcome is `k_i * (m // k_i) = m`.
   - **Total Bet Check:** The program checks if the total amount bet `sum(c)` is less than `m`. If `sum(c) < m`, then the solution is valid because the amount received back for any winning outcome will be `m`, which is strictly greater than `sum(c)`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Multipliers are the Same:** If all multipliers `k_i` are the same, the LCM will be that value, and the bets will be distributed equally. The total bet will be `n * (m // k_i)`, which is equal to `m` if `k_i` is the same for all `i`. In this case, the program correctly outputs `-1` because `sum(c) == m`.
   - **Different Multipliers:** If the multipliers are different, the LCM will be a larger number, and the total bet `sum(c)` will be less than `m` if the multipliers are sufficiently different. The program correctly handles this case by distributing the bets and checking the total.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and distributes the bets in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. It also handles the edge case where all multipliers are the same and correctly outputs `-1`.

**Correctness: **True****
