### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires distributing coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - For the condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` to hold for all `i`, we need:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all} \quad i
     \]
   - This can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This means that the sum of the bets on all other outcomes must be less than the bet on the i-th outcome multiplied by `(k_i - 1)`.

3. **Solution Approach**:
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all `k_i` values and sets `x_i` to be the LCM divided by `k_i`.
   - This ensures that the sum of all other bets is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i` because `x_i` is proportional to the product of all other `k_j` values.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`. The LCM is used to find a common multiple of all `k_i` values.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function correctly calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates the LCM of all `k_i` values.
   - It then sets `x_i` to be the LCM divided by `k_i`.
   - The program checks if the sum of all bets is less than the LCM. If it is, the bets are valid; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all `k_i` values are the same, the LCM will be that value, and the sum of all bets will be equal to the total amount received back, which does not satisfy the condition. Hence, the output should be `-1` in such cases.
   - The program correctly handles this edge case by checking if `sum(c) >= m` and printing `-1` if true.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - The function correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers `a` and `b`.
  - The state before the function call is that `a` and `b` are positive integers.
  - The function returns the integer result of `a * b` divided by `gcd(a, b)`, which is the LCM.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - The function correctly calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.
  - The state before the function call is that `numbers` is a non-empty list of positive integers.
  - The function returns the final value produced by applying `func_1` to all elements of `numbers` in sequence.

- **Main Program**:
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.
  - It calculates the LCM of all `k_i` values using `func_2`.
  - It sets `x_i` to be the LCM divided by `k_i`.
  - It checks if the sum of all bets is less than the LCM. If it is, the bets are valid; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Final Evaluation:

- The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly calculate the LCM of the given `k_i` values.
- The approach of setting `x_i` to the LCM divided by `k_i` ensures that the sum of all other bets is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i` for all `i`, satisfying the problem's condition.
- The edge case where all `k_i` values are the same is correctly handled by returning `-1`.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Final: **True**
