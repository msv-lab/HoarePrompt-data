### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, the amount received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total bet is `sum(x_i)`, and the condition is that `k_i * x_i > sum(x_i)` for all `i`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k` for each outcome.
   - The function `func_2` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k` using the `func_1` function, which calculates the LCM of two numbers.
   - The program then calculates the bets `c` for each outcome as `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM of the multipliers.
   - It checks if the sum of the bets `sum(c)` is less than `m`. If not, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution.
   - If the sum of the bets is less than `m`, it prints the bets.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the LCM of two integers `a` and `b` using the formula `LCM(a, b) = abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
   - Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, `abs(a * b)` is simply `a * b`.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function computes the LCM of a list of integers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.
   - The initial value of `result` is set to the first element of the list, and it is updated by applying `func_1` to `result` and the next element in the list.
   - The final value of `result` is the LCM of all the elements in the list.

5. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The program calculates the bets `c` as `m // k[i]` for each outcome `i`.
   - It then checks if `sum(c) < m`. If this condition is met, the bets are valid and are printed. Otherwise, `-1` is printed.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers.
   - The bets are calculated as `m // k[i]`, which ensures that `k_i * x_i` is a multiple of `m` and thus greater than or equal to `m`.
   - The condition `sum(c) < m` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The program handles the case where no valid distribution is possible by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
