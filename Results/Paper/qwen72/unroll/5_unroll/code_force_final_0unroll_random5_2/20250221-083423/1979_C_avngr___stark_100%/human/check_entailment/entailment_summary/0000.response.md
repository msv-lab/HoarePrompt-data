**Reasoning:**

The problem requires us to determine a way to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome. This means that for each outcome \(i\), the bet \(x_i\) should be such that:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]

for all \(i\).

### Analysis of the Functions

1. **func_1(a, b):**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **func_2(numbers):**
   - This function calculates the LCM of a list of integers.
   - It iteratively applies `func_1` to the list, starting with the first number and then combining it with each subsequent number.
   - The result is the LCM of all the numbers in the list.

### Main Program Logic

- The main program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(n\) and the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
- It calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
- It then calculates the bets \(x_i\) for each outcome as \( \frac{m}{k_i} \), where \(m\) is the LCM.
- If the sum of the bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) is greater than or equal to \(m\), it prints \(-1\) (indicating no valid solution).
- Otherwise, it prints the bets \(x_i\).

### Verification

- **LCM Calculation:**
  - The LCM of the multipliers \(k_i\) ensures that the bets \(x_i\) are integers and that the total sum of bets is minimized.
  - The LCM is a common multiple of all \(k_i\), so \( \frac{m}{k_i} \) will always be an integer.

- **Sum of Bets:**
  - The sum of the bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) should be less than \(m\).
  - This is because \(m\) is the LCM of all \(k_i\), and each \(x_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\) is a fraction of \(m\).
  - If the sum of these fractions is greater than or equal to \(m\), it means that the bets are not distributed in a way that ensures a profit for any outcome.

- **Output:**
  - If the sum of the bets is less than \(m\), the program prints the bets.
  - If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to \(m\), the program prints \(-1\).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of coins that ensures a profit for any winning outcome. The use of the LCM ensures that the bets are integers and the sum of the bets is minimized, which is necessary to meet the problem's constraints.

**Correctness: True**
