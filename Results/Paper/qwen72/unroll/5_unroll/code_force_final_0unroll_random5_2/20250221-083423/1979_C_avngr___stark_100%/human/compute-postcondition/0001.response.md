The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `numbers[1:]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the slice `numbers[1:]`. If `numbers[1:]` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Given that `numbers` is a non-empty list of integers, `numbers[1:]` will have at least one element if `numbers` has more than one element. Before the loop starts, `result` is equal to the first element of `numbers`, but this does not affect the loop's ability to execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `numbers` must have at least two elements, and `num` will be the second element in the list.

State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `result` is equal to the first element of `numbers`, `num` is the second element in `numbers`**
