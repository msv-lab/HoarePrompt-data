Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty list of integers `numbers` and returns a single integer that is the result of sequentially applying the function `func_1` to all elements of the list. After the function concludes, the input list `numbers` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the final result of the computation. **
