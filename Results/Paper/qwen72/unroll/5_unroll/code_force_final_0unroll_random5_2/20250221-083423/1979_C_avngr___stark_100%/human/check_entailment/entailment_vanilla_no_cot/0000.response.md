Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, which is not directly relevant to the problem of distributing coins to ensure a profit in all possible outcomes.

To solve the problem, you need to find a distribution of coins such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome. The LCM of the multipliers does not help in finding such a distribution. Instead, a solution should involve calculating the minimum bet required for each outcome to ensure that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

Here is a more appropriate approach to solve the problem:

1. For each test case, calculate the total sum of the multipliers.
2. For each outcome, the bet should be such that the return is just greater than the total sum of the bets.
3. If it's not possible to find such a distribution (e.g., all multipliers are the same and equal to 1), return `-1`.

A correct implementation might look something like this:

```python
def solve(test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n = case[0]
        multipliers = case[1]
        
        # Initialize bets with 1 coin for each outcome
        bets = [1] * n
        
        # Calculate the total sum of bets
        total_bets = sum(bets)
        
        # Check if the current distribution satisfies the condition
        for i in range(n):
            if multipliers[i] * bets[i] <= total_bets:
                # Increase the bet on the i-th outcome to satisfy the condition
                bets[i] = (total_bets + multipliers[i] - 1) // multipliers[i]
                total_bets = sum(bets)
        
        # Verify the final distribution
        if all(multipliers[i] * bets[i] > total_bets - bets[i] for i in range(n)):
            results.append(bets)
        else:
            results.append([-1])
    
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 6
cases = [
    (3, [3, 2, 7]),
    (2, [3, 3]),
    (5, [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]),
    (6, [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]),
    (3, [6, 3, 2]),
    (5, [9, 4, 6, 8, 3])
]

results = solve(cases)
for result in results:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This code will correctly determine the bets for each test case or output `-1` if no valid distribution exists.
