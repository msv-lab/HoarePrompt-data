The function reads `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, n * k ≤ 2 * 10^5) representing the number of participants and the number of orders, respectively. It then reads `m` lines, each containing `n` distinct integers representing the order of participants shown to a particular participant. The function checks if the orders are consistent with a specific condition and prints 'yes' if they are, or 'no' if they are not. After processing all test cases, the function has no lasting state, as all variables are reset or redefined for each test case.
