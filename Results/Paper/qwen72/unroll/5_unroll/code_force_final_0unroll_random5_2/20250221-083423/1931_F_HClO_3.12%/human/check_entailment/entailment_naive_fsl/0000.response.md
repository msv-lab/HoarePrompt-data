Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the order of participants in the screenshots is consistent but the authors of the screenshots are not in the correct positions. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the first two screenshots can always be used to determine the correct order of participants, which is not always true.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 3
1 2 3 4
2 3 4 1
3 4 1 2
```

For this test case, the correct output should be "YES" because there is a consistent order of participants that all screenshots could correspond to, which is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`. However, the program will output "NO" because it incorrectly processes the first two screenshots and fails to correctly handle the third screenshot.

The issue lies in the logic that tries to determine the correct order of participants based on the first two screenshots. The program should consider all screenshots to ensure that the order is consistent for all participants.
