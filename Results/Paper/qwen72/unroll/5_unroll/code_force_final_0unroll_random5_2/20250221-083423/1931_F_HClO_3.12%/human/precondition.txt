t is a positive integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4. Each test case contains two positive integers n and k, where 1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 and n \cdot k \le 2 \cdot 10^5. Each of the k lines contains n unique integers a_{ij} (1 \le a_{ij} \le n) representing the order of participants as seen by the participant a_{i0}, who is always at the top of the list in their own screenshot. All authors of the screenshots are different.
