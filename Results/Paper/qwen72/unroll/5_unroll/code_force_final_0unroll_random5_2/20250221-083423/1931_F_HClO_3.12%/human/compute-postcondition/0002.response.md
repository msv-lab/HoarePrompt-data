Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n` and `m` from input. Depending on the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `l1` and `l2`, it either prints 'yes' or 'no'. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` are no longer relevant, and the lists `l1`, `l2`, and `l3` are modified or reset during each iteration, so they do not retain any specific state from one iteration to the next. The only consistent state is that the loop has completed `t` iterations.**
