### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length `2^a_i`.

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of valid triangles.
   - It also initializes `total_count` to 0, which will store the cumulative count of sticks processed so far.
   - For each unique stick length `cnt` in `num_of_lens`:
     - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \) and adds this to `res`.
     - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \) and multiplies it by `total_count` (the number of sticks processed so far). This is added to `res`.
     - It updates `total_count` by adding the current `cnt`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result `res` to the `results` list for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.

### Analysis:
- **Triangle Inequality Theorem:**
  - For three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
  - Given the stick lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a triangle is if all three sticks have the same length. This is because the sum of two smaller powers of 2 will never be greater than the next higher power of 2 (e.g., \(2^1 + 2^1 = 4\) is not greater than \(2^2 = 4\)).

- **Combination Calculations:**
  - The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} \).
  - It also correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \) and multiplying by the cumulative count of sticks processed so far.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where `n` is 1 or 2 by correctly not forming any triangles.
  - It also handles cases where all sticks have different lengths by correctly outputting 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles from the given stick lengths. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
