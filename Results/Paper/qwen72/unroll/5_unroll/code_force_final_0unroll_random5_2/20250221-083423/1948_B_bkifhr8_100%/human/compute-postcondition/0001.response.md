The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and should start at 0.

Given the state before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer and must be within the range 2 to 50 for the function to process the array `a`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1. However, since `n` is specified to be at least 2 in the problem statement, we can use this information to adjust the state.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `_` is 0**
