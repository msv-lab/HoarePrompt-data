Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading the length of the array `m` and the array `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption**: The function starts with the assumption that the array can be made non-decreasing (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Traversal**: The function traverses the array from the end to the beginning. This is a good approach because if an element is out of order, it checks if the operation can be applied to the previous element to fix the order.

4. **Operation Simulation**: When an element `arr[i]` is found to be less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`, the function simulates the operation by splitting `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appending `arr[i]` to the list of digits. It then checks if the resulting list is sorted. If it is not, the function sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output**: The function prints 'YES' if the array can be made non-decreasing, and 'NO' otherwise.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:
- The function only checks if the operation can be applied to a single out-of-order element and its preceding element. It does not account for the possibility that multiple operations might be needed to sort the array.
- Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the operation might need to be applied to the same element multiple times (e.g., if `arr[i - 1]` is a large number with multiple digits).

### Example Analysis:
- **First Test Case**: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
  - The function correctly identifies that the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting `12` into `[1, 2]` and inserting `1` and `2` in place of `12`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`.

- **Second Test Case**: `[12, 28, 5]`
  - The function fails to correctly identify that the array cannot be made non-decreasing. It only checks the immediate previous element and does not consider the full sequence of operations needed.

- **Third Test Case**: `[0, 0]`
  - The function correctly identifies that the array is already non-decreasing.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly handle all cases where multiple operations might be needed to sort the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
