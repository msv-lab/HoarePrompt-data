Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the transformation of elements that are at least 10. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the program attempts to split the elements and check if the array can be sorted. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Splitting and Merging**:
   - The program splits the element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits. This is incorrect because the operation should replace `arr[i - 1]` with its digits, not append `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
   - The program then checks if the list of digits (plus the appended `arr[i]`) is sorted, which is not the correct condition to check. The correct condition should be to check if the array remains sorted after the transformation.

2. **Handling of Multiple Digits**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the insertion of multiple digits from a single element. For example, if `arr[i - 1]` is 67, it should be replaced by [6, 7], not [6, 7, arr[i]].

3. **Early Termination**:
   - The program terminates early if it finds an unsorted pair, but it does not correctly account for the possibility of further transformations that could still result in a sorted array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    def split_number(num):
        return [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
    
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        if arr[i] < 10:
            continue
        digits = split_number(arr[i])
        new_arr = arr[:i] + digits + arr[i+1:]
        if new_arr == sorted(new_arr):
            return True
        arr[i] = digits[0]
        for j in range(1, len(digits)):
            arr.insert(i + j, digits[j])
        if arr == sorted(arr):
            return True
    return arr == sorted(arr)

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if can_be_sorted(arr):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the splitting of elements and checks if the array can be sorted after each transformation. It also ensures that the array is checked for sorted order after all possible transformations.
