Output State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99) of length `n`. The function should be able to process a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3). `n` is now an input integer.**
