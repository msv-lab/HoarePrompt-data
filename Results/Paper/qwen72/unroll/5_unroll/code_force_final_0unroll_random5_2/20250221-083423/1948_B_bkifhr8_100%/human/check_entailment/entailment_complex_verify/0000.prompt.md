You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99) of length `n`. The function should be able to process a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: The function processes all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the array `arr` can be made non-decreasing by changing at most one element. The variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged, and the internal state of the function (variables `m`, `arr`, and `ans`) is reset for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `m` and a list of integers `arr` of length `m`. It prints 'YES' if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by changing at most one element, and 'NO' otherwise. The number of test cases `t` is not explicitly managed within the function, and the function does not return any value. The internal state of the function (variables `m`, `arr`, and `ans`) is reset for each iteration of the outer loop, which runs `n` times. The variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the program only attempts to split the element `arr[i - 1]` when it finds that `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`. However, it does not consider the possibility of splitting `arr[i]` or any other elements that might be necessary to achieve a sorted array. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

The program will fail on the second test case:
```
3
12 28 5
```

The correct output should be `NO` because no matter how you split the elements, you cannot make the array sorted. However, the program will incorrectly output `YES` because it only checks the split of `arr[i - 1]` and does not consider the split of `arr[i]` or any other elements that might be necessary to achieve a sorted array.
