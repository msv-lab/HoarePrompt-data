### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Initial Assumption**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `True`, assuming that the array can be made non-decreasing.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning (from `m-1` to `1`).
   - If it finds an element `arr[i]` that is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`, it checks if the digits of `arr[i-1]` can be split and inserted in such a way that the resulting subarray is sorted.
   - The digits of `arr[i-1]` are split and added to a list `nums` along with `arr[i]`.
   - The function then checks if `nums` is sorted. If it is not, the array cannot be made non-decreasing, and `ans` is set to `False`.
   - If `nums` is sorted, the first digit of `nums` is assigned back to `arr[i-1]`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, the function prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Splitting and Insertion**:
  - The function only splits the element `arr[i-1]` and checks if the resulting list `nums` is sorted. However, the problem requires that the digits of the element be inserted in the same position in the array, not just checked in a temporary list.
  - The function should split the element `arr[i-1]` and insert the digits back into the array at the correct position, then check if the array can be made non-decreasing.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or where the array can be made sorted by splitting a single element correctly.

### Corrected Approach:
- For each element `arr[i-1]` that is greater than or equal to 10 and is greater than `arr[i]`, split `arr[i-1]` into its digits and insert them back into the array at the correct position.
- After each split, check if the array is sorted. If it is, continue to the next test case. If it is not, set `ans` to `False` and break out of the loop.

### Correctness:
- The given program is **incorrect** because it does not properly handle the insertion of digits back into the array and does not correctly check if the array can be made non-decreasing.

### Correctness: **False**
