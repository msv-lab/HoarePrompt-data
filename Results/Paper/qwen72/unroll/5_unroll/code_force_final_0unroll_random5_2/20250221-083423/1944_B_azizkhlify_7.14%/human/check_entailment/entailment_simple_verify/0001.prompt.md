You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: The loop will have processed all the test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed pairs of integers from the list `a` that appear twice in the first half of the list, followed by any remaining integers needed to reach the total count of `k * 2` from the first half of the list. After that, it will print any remaining integers needed to reach the total count of `k * 2` from the second half of the list. The variables `l`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` will be reset for each test case, but the overall structure of the loop will remain the same.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of length `n` to keep track of the counts of elements in the first half and the second half of `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to zero. These variables are used to keep track of the number of elements processed and the lengths of the subsets `l` and `r`.

3. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of each element in the first half of `a` and stores the counts in `l`.
   - It counts the occurrences of each element in the second half of `a` and stores the counts in `r`.

4. **Constructing Subsets:**
   - The program attempts to construct the subset `l` by selecting elements that appear twice in the first half of `a`.
   - It prints these elements and updates `ul` to keep track of the number of elements added to `l`.
   - If `ul` reaches `2k`, it breaks out of the loop.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - If `ul` is less than `2k`, the program selects elements that appear once in the first half of `a` and adds them to `l`.
   - It prints these elements and updates `re` and `res` to keep track of the number of elements added and the elements themselves.

6. **Constructing Subset `r`:**
   - The program prints the elements stored in `res` to form the subset `r`.
   - If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, it attempts to construct the subset `r` by selecting elements that appear twice in the second half of `a`.
   - It prints these elements and updates `ur` to keep track of the number of elements added to `r`.

### Analysis:

- **Subset Construction:**
  - The program correctly constructs subsets `l` and `r` by selecting elements from the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
  - It ensures that the subsets are of length `2k` by checking the counts of elements and breaking out of the loop when the required length is reached.

- **XOR Condition:**
  - The program does not explicitly check the XOR condition but relies on the fact that the problem guarantees at least one valid pair of subsets `l` and `r` exists.
  - The selection of elements is based on their counts, which should ensure that the XOR condition is met.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 and the case where `k` is greater than 1.
  - It also handles the case where the elements are distributed differently in the first and second halves of `a`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to follow the logic required to solve the problem. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect XOR Handling:**
   - The program does not explicitly ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r`. This is a critical part of the problem statement.

2. **Subset Lengths:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the construction of subsets `l` and `r` to ensure they are of length `2k` and meet the XOR condition.

3. **Variable Usage:**
   - The variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are used in a way that is not clearly aligned with the problem requirements. For example, `ul` and `ur` should be used to ensure the subsets are of length `2k`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r`, and it does not handle the construction of subsets `l` and `r` to ensure they are of length `2k` and meet the XOR condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
