Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The condition `if n >= m:` only checks if the number of moves is greater than or equal to the target number of cubes, but it does not consider whether the number of moves can actually result in a tower with exactly `m` cubes.

For example, consider the test case where `n = 2` and `m = 4`. According to the problem, it is impossible to end up with a tower of 4 cubes after exactly 2 moves, because each move can only add or remove one cube. However, the program will incorrectly output "Yes" for this case.

Another example is the test case where `n = 5` and `m = 3`. The program will output "Yes" because `n >= m`, but the correct output should be "Yes" only if `n` is odd and `m` is less than or equal to `n`, or if `n` is even and `m` is less than or equal to `n` and `m` is even.

The correct logic should be:
- If `n` is odd, `m` can be any value from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- If `n` is even, `m` can be any even value from 2 to `n` (inclusive).

The provided program does not account for these conditions, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
