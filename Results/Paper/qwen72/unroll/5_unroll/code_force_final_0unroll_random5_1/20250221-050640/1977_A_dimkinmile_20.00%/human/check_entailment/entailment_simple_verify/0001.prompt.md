You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and m, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: *The function takes two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `n` and `m` are specific non-negative integers provided by the input, and the input is split into two integers. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `m`. If `n` is less than `m`, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `m`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`kreker = int(input())`). It then iterates over each test case using a `for` loop.

2. **Function Call**: Inside the loop, the program calls the function `func_1()` for each test case.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input. This is done correctly using `map(int, input().split())`.

4. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` using the condition `if n >= m:`. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

5. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add or remove one cube. Therefore, the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves can be any integer between `0` and `n` (inclusive) if `n` is even, or any integer between `0` and `n` (inclusive) that has the same parity as `n` if `n` is odd.
   - The condition `n >= m` is not sufficient to determine if `m` cubes can be in the tower after `n` moves. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 1`, the program would print "Yes" even though it is impossible to have exactly 1 cube after 2 moves (the only possible outcomes are 0 or 2 cubes).

6. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition should be that `m` must be less than or equal to `n` and `m` must have the same parity as `n` (i.e., both `m` and `n` must be either even or odd).

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not account for the parity of `n` and `m`.

Correctness: **False**
