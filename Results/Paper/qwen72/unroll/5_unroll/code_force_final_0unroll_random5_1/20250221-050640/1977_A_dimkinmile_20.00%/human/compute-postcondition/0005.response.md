Postcondition: ***The function takes two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `n` and `m` are specific non-negative integers provided by the input, and the input is split into two integers. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `m`. If `n` is less than `m`, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `m`.***
