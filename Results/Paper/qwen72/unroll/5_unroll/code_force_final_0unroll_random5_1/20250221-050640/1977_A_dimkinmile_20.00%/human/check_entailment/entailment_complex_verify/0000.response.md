Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the logic of the `func_1` function. The condition `if n >= m:` is insufficient to determine whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, as it does not consider the parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to account for the following:
- If `n` is odd, `m` can be any value from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- If `n` is even, `m` can be any even value from 2 to `n` (inclusive).

The provided program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not enough to ensure the correct output. For example:
- In the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the program will output "Yes" incorrectly because `n` is less than `m`.
- In the test case `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the program will output "Yes" correctly, but it will also output "Yes" for `n = 4` and `m = 3`, which is incorrect because `n` is even and `m` is odd.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
