Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if, after `n` moves, the resulting tower can have exactly `m` cubes. Each move can either add or remove one cube, and the tower starts with zero cubes. Therefore, the key condition to check is whether the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of additions and removals must balance out in such a way that the total number of moves is even if `m` is non-zero.

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it simply checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise. This is incorrect because:

1. **Even Difference Condition**: The correct condition should be whether `(n - m)` is even. If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), then it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
2. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes, so the number of moves `n` must be at least `m` to have `m` cubes, but it must also be possible to balance the additions and removals.

Let's analyze the provided test cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - The difference `n - m = 0`, which is even. Therefore, it is possible to end up with exactly 3 cubes after 3 moves (e.g., add 3 cubes).
  - The program correctly prints "Yes".

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - The difference `n - m = -2`, which is even. However, it is not possible to end up with 4 cubes after 2 moves because the maximum number of cubes you can have after 2 moves is 2 (e.g., add 2 cubes).
  - The program incorrectly prints "No" because it only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - The difference `n - m = 2`, which is even. Therefore, it is possible to end up with exactly 3 cubes after 5 moves (e.g., add 3 cubes, remove 2 cubes).
  - The program correctly prints "Yes".

The program fails to handle the second test case correctly, which means it does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
