Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `N` is sorted. This is a good approach because it allows us to process the elements in increasing order, which is essential for calculating the MEX.

3. **Tracking MEX**: The program uses a variable `cur` to track the current MEX value and a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each element in `N`.

4. **Processing the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` and `M` accordingly.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks the loop because the MEX has been found.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - After processing the array, the program checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if the count of any integer `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop.

6. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `cur` for each test case.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Dictionary Initialization**: The dictionary `M` is not initialized properly for each test case. This can lead to incorrect results if the same key is used in multiple test cases.
- **Counting Logic**: The logic for counting the occurrences of elements in `M` is not correct. The program should initialize `M` for each test case and correctly count the occurrences of each element.
- **Final MEX Check**: The final check for the MEX value is not necessary and can be simplified.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        N.sort()
        
        cur = -1
        
        M = {}
        
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        
        # Simplify the final MEX check
        for i in range(cur + 1):
            if i not in M or M[i] <= i:
                cur = i
                break
        
        print(cur)
```

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
