The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will be set to 0 on the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
