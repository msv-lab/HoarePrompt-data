### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Cases Handling**:
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is a good approach because it allows us to process the elements in increasing order, which is crucial for determining the MEX.

3. **Tracking the Current MEX**:
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1. This variable will be used to track the current MEX value.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array `N`.

4. **Processing the Array**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` and `M` accordingly.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this means the MEX has been found.
   - If `num` is exactly `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, it increments the frequency of `cur` in `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - After processing the array, the program checks if the sum of the frequencies in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1, which is incorrect because the sum of frequencies should be the length of the array, not `S`.
   - The program then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if the frequency of any element `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop, which is the correct approach to find the MEX.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `cur`, which is the MEX of the array `c`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Sum Check**: The line `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:` is incorrect. The sum of the frequencies in `M` should be the length of the array `N`, not `S`. This is a logical error that can affect the final result.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == len(N):
            cur += 1
        for i in range(cur):
            if M.get(i, 0) <= i:
                cur = i
                break
        print(cur)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the sum check, which can lead to incorrect results.
- The corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
