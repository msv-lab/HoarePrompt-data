You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

    func_2(lst, n)

def func_1(list, n):

            return False
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the list and n remain unchanged. If any element in the list from index 0 to n-1 is non-zero, the function returns False.

            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]

    #State: The list is modified such that for each index i (1 <= i < n - 1), if list[i] was initially greater than 1 and both list[i - 1] and list[i + 1] were greater than 0, then list[i] and list[i - 1] are reduced to 0, and list[i + 1] is reduced by the value of list[i - 1]. If at any point list[i - 1] is not 0, the loop prints 'no' and returns, leaving the list in an undefined state. Otherwise, the loop completes and the list is in a state where no index i (1 <= i < n - 1) has list[i] > 1 and both list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0.
    if func_1(list, n) :

        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list is modified such that for each index i (1 <= i < n - 1), if list[i] was initially greater than 1 and both list[i - 1] and list[i + 1] were greater than 0, then list[i] and list[i - 1] are reduced to 0, and list[i + 1] is reduced by the value of list[i - 1]. If at any point list[i - 1] is not 0, the loop prints 'no' and returns, leaving the list in an undefined state. Otherwise, the loop completes and the list is in a state where no index i (1 <= i < n - 1) has list[i] > 1 and both list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0. Additionally, the function `func_1(list, n)` either returns `True` or `False`, which determines whether the if or else part was executed.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific issue is that the `func_2` function does not correctly simulate the operations described in the problem. The operations are supposed to decrement `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the current implementation uses `list[i - 1]` as a multiplier, which is incorrect. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the array is already all zeros, and it does not correctly check if the array can be made all zeros by the operations.

Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not correctly simulate the operations to make all elements zero.
