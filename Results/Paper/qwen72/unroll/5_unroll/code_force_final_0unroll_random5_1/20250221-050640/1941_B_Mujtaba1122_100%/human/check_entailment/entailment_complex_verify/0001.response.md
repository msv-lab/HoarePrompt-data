### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using the specified operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n - 1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1, respectively.

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(list, n)` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list from index 0 to \( n-1 \) and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correctly implemented and works as intended.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(list, n)` attempts to apply the operations to the list to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index \( i \), it performs the operation while \( list[i] > 1 \) and both \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are greater than 0.
   - The operation is performed as follows:
     - \( list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1] \)
     - \( list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1] \)
     - \( list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1] \)
   - This is incorrect because the problem specifies that each element should be decremented by fixed values (1, 2, 1), not by the value of \( list[i-1] \).
   - The current implementation can lead to negative values in the array, which is not allowed according to the problem constraints.
   - The check `if list[i-1] != 0:` is not necessary and can be removed since the operation should only be performed when all three elements are positive.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The correct implementation should only perform the operation when \( list[i] > 1 \) and both \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are greater than 0.
   - The operation should be:
     - \( list[i-1] -= 1 \)
     - \( list[i] -= 2 \)
     - \( list[i+1] -= 1 \)
   - After performing the operation, it should check if the array can be made zero.

5. **Evaluation of the Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function calls.
   - However, the annotations do not highlight the critical issue with the operation in `func_2`.
   - The annotations also correctly describe the behavior of `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect because the operation in `func_2` is not implemented according to the problem description, and it can lead to negative values in the array, which is not allowed. Additionally, the check `if list[i-1] != 0:` is unnecessary and can be removed.

Final: **False**
