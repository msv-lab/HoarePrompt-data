The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `list` and `n`. `list` is a list of integers, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. All elements in `list` are non-negative integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9). The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` within the specified range, and return a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
