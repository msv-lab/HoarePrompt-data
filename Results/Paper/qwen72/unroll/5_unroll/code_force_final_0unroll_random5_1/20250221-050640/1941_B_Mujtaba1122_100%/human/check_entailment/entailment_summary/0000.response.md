### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using the given operation.
   - The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
     - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero, otherwise it returns `True`.
     - This function is correct and straightforward.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list to zero using the given operation.
     - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., the second to the second-to-last element).
     - For each index \( i \), it checks if \( list[i] > 1 \) and both \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are greater than 0.
     - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
       - \( list[i+1] \) is decremented by \( list[i-1] \)
       - \( list[i] \) is decremented by \( 2 \times list[i-1] \)
       - \( list[i-1] \) is decremented by \( list[i-1] \)
     - If at any point \( list[i-1] \) is not zero, it prints 'no' and returns, indicating that the operation cannot be completed.
     - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
     - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The operation in `func_2` is not correctly implemented. The operation should decrement \( list[i-1] \), \( list[i] \), and \( list[i+1] \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the current implementation is decrementing \( list[i+1] \) by \( list[i-1] \), \( list[i] \) by \( 2 \times list[i-1] \), and \( list[i-1] \) by \( list[i-1] \). This is incorrect and will not achieve the desired result.
   - The condition `if list[i - 1] != 0` is checked after the while loop, but it should be checked before the while loop to ensure that the operation can be performed.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should be:
     ```python
     def func_2(list, n):
         for i in range(1, n - 1):
             while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
                 list[i - 1] -= 1
                 list[i] -= 2
                 list[i + 1] -= 1
             if list[i - 1] != 0:
                 print('NO')
                 return
         if func_1(list, n):
             print('YES')
         else:
             print('NO')
     ```

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation of `func_2` is incorrect due to the incorrect operation and the placement of the check for non-zero elements.
   - The program as a whole is therefore incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
