Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific issue is that the `func_2` function does not correctly simulate the operations described in the problem. The operations are supposed to decrement `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the current implementation uses `list[i - 1]` as a multiplier, which is incorrect. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the array is already all zeros, and it does not correctly check if the array can be made all zeros by the operations.

Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not correctly simulate the operations to make all elements zero.
