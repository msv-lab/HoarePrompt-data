Postcondition: **The list is modified such that for each index i (1 <= i < n - 1), if list[i] was initially greater than 1 and both list[i - 1] and list[i + 1] were greater than 0, then list[i] and list[i - 1] are reduced to 0, and list[i + 1] is reduced by the value of list[i - 1]. If at any point list[i - 1] is not 0, the loop prints 'no' and returns, leaving the list in an undefined state. Otherwise, the loop completes and the list is in a state where no index i (1 <= i < n - 1) has list[i] > 1 and both list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0. Additionally, the function `func_1(list, n)` either returns `True` or `False`, which determines whether the if or else part was executed.**
