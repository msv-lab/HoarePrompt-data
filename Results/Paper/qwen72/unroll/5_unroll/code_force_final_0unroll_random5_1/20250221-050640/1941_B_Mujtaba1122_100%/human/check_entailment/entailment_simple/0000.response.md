### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `lst`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If the loop completes without returning `False`, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list to zero using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., `1 <= i < n-1`).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation as long as `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - The operation reduces `list[i-1]` by 1, `list[i]` by 2, and `list[i+1]` by 1, using the value of `list[i-1]` as the multiplier.
   - If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, it prints 'no' and returns, indicating that it is impossible to make all elements zero.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

4. **Logical Flaw:**
   - The key issue with the program is in the `while` loop inside `func_2`.
   - The loop condition `while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0` is correct, but the operation inside the loop is not.
   - The operation `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`, and `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is incorrect because it uses `list[i-1]` as the multiplier, which can lead to incorrect reductions.
   - The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     ```
   - This ensures that each operation reduces the elements by the correct amount.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array cannot be reduced to zero correctly. For example, if the array is `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`, the program will incorrectly print 'NO' because it uses the wrong multiplier in the operation.
   - The program also does not handle cases where the array is already zero or where the array has elements that cannot be reduced to zero using the given operations.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the logical flaw in the `while` loop inside `func_2`. The operation inside the loop should reduce each element by a fixed amount (1, 2, 1) rather than using `list[i-1]` as a multiplier.

**Correctness: **False****
