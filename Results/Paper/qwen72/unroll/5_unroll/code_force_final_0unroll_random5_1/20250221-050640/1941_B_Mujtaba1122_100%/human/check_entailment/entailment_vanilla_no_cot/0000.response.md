Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application:**
   - In `func_2`, the operation is applied incorrectly. The operation should decrement `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. However, the code is decrementing `list[i + 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` by `1 * list[i - 1]`, `2 * list[i - 1]`, and `1 * list[i - 1]` respectively. This is not the correct way to apply the operation.

2. **Infinite Loop Potential:**
   - The `while` loop in `func_2` can potentially run indefinitely if the conditions are met but the values are not decremented correctly. This can lead to an infinite loop.

3. **Incorrect Check for Zero Elements:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero, but it is called after the `while` loop in `func_2` which may not have correctly applied the operations to make all elements zero.

4. **Output Handling:**
   - The program prints 'no' directly in `func_2` if `list[i - 1]` is not zero, which is not the correct output format as specified in the problem. The correct output should be 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array is already zero or when the array cannot be made zero due to the constraints of the operation.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to check if the array can be made zero by applying the operation. The key observation is that the sum of the array elements must be divisible by 4, and the array must be non-decreasing up to the last element. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(n, arr):
    if sum(arr) % 4 != 0:
        return False
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True

def solve(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, arr in test_cases:
        if can_make_zero(n, arr):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    return results

# Example usage
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

results = solve(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This program checks if the sum of the array is divisible by 4 and if the array is non-decreasing, which are necessary conditions for the array to be made zero. If both conditions are met, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".
