### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation.
   - The operation involves choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If the loop completes without finding any non-zero elements, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list to zero using the specified operation.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if \( list[i] > 1 \) and both \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are greater than 0.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation \( list[i-1] -= list[i-1] \), \( list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1] \), and \( list[i+1] -= list[i-1] \).
   - If at any point \( list[i-1] \) is not zero, it prints 'no' and returns, indicating that it is not possible to make all elements zero.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Issues in `func_2`**:
   - The operation \( list[i-1] -= list[i-1] \), \( list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1] \), and \( list[i+1] -= list[i-1] \) is incorrect.
   - The correct operation should be \( list[i-1] -= 1 \), \( list[i] -= 2 \), and \( list[i+1] -= 1 \).
   - The current implementation reduces \( list[i-1] \) by itself, which is not the intended operation.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should reduce \( list[i-1] \) by 1, \( list[i] \) by 2, and \( list[i+1] \) by 1.
   - The loop should continue until \( list[i] \) is no longer greater than 1 or either \( list[i-1] \) or \( list[i+1] \) is zero.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation of `func_2` is incorrect because it does not perform the specified operation correctly.
   - Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect.
