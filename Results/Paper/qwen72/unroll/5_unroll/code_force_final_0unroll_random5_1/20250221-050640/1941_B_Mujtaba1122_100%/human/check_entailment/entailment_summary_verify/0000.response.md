### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify them step-by-step:

1. **Incorrect Operation Simulation**:
   - The problem description specifies that for each operation, the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` should be decremented by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - However, in `func_2`, the operation is incorrectly implemented as:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
   - This means that `list[i + 1]` is decremented by the value of `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]` is decremented by twice the value of `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i - 1]` is decremented by its own value. This is not equivalent to the specified operation and can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Handling of Zero Arrays**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the array is already all zeros. It should immediately print "YES" in such a case.
   - The function `func_1` checks if all elements are zero, but it is only called after `func_2` has attempted to modify the array. If the array is already all zeros, `func_2` will still attempt to modify it, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect behavior.

3. **Termination and State**:
   - The function `func_2` prints "no" and returns if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the loop. This leaves the array in an undefined state, which is not ideal.
   - The function should instead return a boolean value indicating whether the array can be made all zeros, and the main logic should handle the printing of "YES" or "NO".

4. **Test Case Verification**:
   - The provided test case:
     ```python
     Input:
     1
     5
     1 3 5 5 2
     ```
     - Expected Output: `YES`
     - Actual Output: `NO`
   - This test case demonstrates that the program fails to correctly simulate the operations and determine if the array can be made all zeros.

### Correct Implementation:

A correct implementation should:
- Check if the array is already all zeros.
- Simulate the operations correctly by decrementing `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
- Ensure that the operations do not leave the array in an undefined state.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(list, n):
    # Check if the array is already all zeros
    if all(x == 0 for x in list):
        return True
    
    # Simulate the operations
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] >= 2 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i + 1] -= 1
    
    # Check if the array is now all zeros
    return all(x == 0 for x in list)

def solve(t, test_cases):
    for _ in range(t):
        n = test_cases[_][0]
        list = test_cases[_][1]
        if can_make_zero(list, n):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

solve(t, test_cases)
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly simulate the operations described in the problem and fails to handle certain cases, leading to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
