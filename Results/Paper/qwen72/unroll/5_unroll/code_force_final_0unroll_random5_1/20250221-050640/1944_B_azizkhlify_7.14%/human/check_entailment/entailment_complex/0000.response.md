### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the list `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The function initializes two lists `l` and `r` of length `n` to count the occurrences of each integer in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
   - It iterates through the first half of `a` and increments the count in `l` for each integer.
   - It iterates through the second half of `a` and increments the count in `r` for each integer.

3. **Printing Pairs from the First Half:**
   - The function initializes `ul` to keep track of the number of integers printed from the first half.
   - It iterates through the first half of `a` and prints pairs of integers that appear exactly twice in the first half, up to `2k` integers.
   - If `ul` reaches `2k`, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Printing Additional Integers from the First Half:**
   - If fewer than `2k` integers are printed from the first half, it calculates the remaining number of integers needed (`k = 2 * k - ul`).
   - It then iterates through the first half again and prints additional integers that appear only once, up to the required count.

5. **Printing Pairs from the Second Half:**
   - The function initializes `ur` to keep track of the number of integers printed from the second half.
   - It ensures that the number of integers printed from the second half matches the number printed from the first half (`ul`).
   - It iterates through the second half of `a` and prints pairs of integers that appear exactly twice in the second half, up to `2k` integers.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the required integers in two lines, one for the first half and one for the second half.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Counting and Printing Logic:**
  - The function uses `l` and `r` to count occurrences, but it does not correctly handle the case where the same integer appears in both halves.
  - The logic for printing pairs and additional integers is flawed. It does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal.
  - The function does not correctly balance the number of integers printed from both halves to ensure the XOR condition is met.

### Correctness:
- The function does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. It only prints pairs and additional integers without considering the XOR condition.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
