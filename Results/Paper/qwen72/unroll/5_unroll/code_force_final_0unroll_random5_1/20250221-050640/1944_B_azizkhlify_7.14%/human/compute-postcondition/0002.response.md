The function `func` accepts two parameters: `a` and `k`. `a` is a list of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The function returns a specific output based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. It returns a value based on the given `a` and `k`.**
