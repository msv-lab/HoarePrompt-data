Output State: **The function definition remains incorrect, and no changes have been made to the initial state. The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. `a` should contain exactly `n` elements, and each element `a_i` should be a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, but the number of test cases `t` is not directly passed to the function. `data` is a list of strings obtained from the user input, split by spaces. `index` is 1, `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**
