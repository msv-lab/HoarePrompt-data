Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program is correct, and it does indeed implement the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the sequential occurrence rule as described in the problem. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but it should be defined to take parameters for the list of periodicities `a` and the number of signs `n`. However, the function reads these values directly from the input, which is not incorrect but unconventional and can be confusing. The function should ideally be defined as `def func_1(a, n):` and called with the appropriate parameters.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach is efficient for large inputs but can be problematic if the input is very large or if the input format is not strictly adhered to. However, for the given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 100), this approach is acceptable and works as expected.

3. **Logic for Calculating Next Year**:
   - The logic for calculating the next year in which a sign occurs is correct. The expression `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`. This correctly handles the sequential occurrence rule.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the results in the correct format, with each result on a new line.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when all signs have the same periodicity (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1`), and when the periodicities are different (e.g., `3 2 4 5 9 18`).

Given the above points, the program is functionally correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The unconventional function definition and input handling are not errors but rather stylistic choices that do not affect the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
