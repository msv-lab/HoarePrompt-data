### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input in a loop, extracting the number of test cases `T` and the number of signs `n` for each test case.
   - The periodicities of the signs are read into a list `a` for each test case.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Calculation of the Next Year for Each Sign:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left( \text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1 \right) // a[i] \times a[i]
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - The `last_year` is then updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.
   - This part of the program correctly implements the logic for sequential occurrence of signs as described in the problem.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program appends the result of each test case to a list `results` as a string.
   - After processing all test cases, it writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly. In this case, the `last_year` will be `a[0]`, which is the correct year for the single sign.
   - The program also handles the case where all signs have the same periodicity (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1`), correctly calculating the year as `5` for the example input.
   - The program correctly calculates the year for more complex periodicities, such as `3 2 4 5 9 18`, resulting in `36`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the sequential occurrence rule as described in the problem. It reads the input as specified, processes each test case by calculating the next occurrence year for each sign, and outputs the results in the correct format. The logic for calculating the next year in which a sign occurs is sound and handles the edge cases correctly.

### Final:
**True**
