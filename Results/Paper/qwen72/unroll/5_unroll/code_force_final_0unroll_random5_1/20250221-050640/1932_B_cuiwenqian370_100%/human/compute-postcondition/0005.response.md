Output State: **The function definition remains incorrect, and no changes have been made to the initial state. `a` should contain exactly `n` elements, and each element `a_i` should be a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). `data` is a list of strings obtained from the user input, split by spaces. `index` is 2, `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`. `results` is an empty list.**
