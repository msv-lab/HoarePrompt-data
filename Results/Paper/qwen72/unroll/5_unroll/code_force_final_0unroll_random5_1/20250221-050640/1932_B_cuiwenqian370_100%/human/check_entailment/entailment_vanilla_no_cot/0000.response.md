Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common approach for competitive programming where input can be large and needs to be processed efficiently.

2. **Test Case Loop**: It iterates over the number of test cases, `T`, which is read from the input.

3. **Sign Periodicities**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and the list of periodicities, `a`.

4. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity, `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.

5. **Updating the Last Year**: It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

6. **Storing Results**: It appends the final `last_year` (which is the year when the n-th sign occurs) to the `results` list.

7. **Output**: Finally, it writes the results to the standard output, each on a new line.

The program correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs and calculates the year when the n-th sign will occur, which is the year the apocalypse will happen according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
