Reasoning: 

The original assessment states that the program is correct, and it does indeed seem to handle the problem as described. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but it reads input directly from `sys.stdin.read`. This is a valid approach for handling input in a competitive programming context, where the input is often provided in a specific format.
   - The input is read and split into a list of strings, and the program correctly processes the number of test cases `T` and the periodicities `a` for each test case.

2. **Calculation of Next Year**:
   - The program uses the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` to calculate the next year in which the i-th sign will occur after the (i-1)-th sign. This formula is correct:
     - `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1)` ensures that the next year is strictly after `last_year`.
     - `// a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next year is a multiple of `a[i]`, which is the periodicity of the i-th sign.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the first sign correctly by initializing `last_year` to `a[0]`.
   - The program also handles the transition between signs correctly, ensuring that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly appends the result for each test case to the `results` list and writes the results to `sys.stdout` in the required format.

5. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program state is as expected at key points. The `index` is correctly updated, and the `results` list is populated with the correct values.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
