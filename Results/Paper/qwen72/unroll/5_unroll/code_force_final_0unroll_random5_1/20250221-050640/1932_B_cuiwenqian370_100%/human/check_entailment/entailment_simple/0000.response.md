Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The program reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the year when the n-th sign will occur by iterating through the signs and determining the next year each sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the number of test cases `T` from the first element of the list.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Calculating the Year of the n-th Sign:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining signs, calculating the next year each sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.
   - The `last_year` is updated to `next_year` for each sign.

3. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result for each test case to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it writes the results to `sys.stdout` with each result on a new line.

**Issues to Consider:**
- The function `func_1` is called without any parameters, but it should take the list of periodicities `a` and the number of signs `n` as parameters.
- The function definition should be updated to `def func_1(a, n):` to match the expected parameters.
- The function should handle the input and output in a more structured way, but the current implementation is functional and correct for the given problem.

**Conclusion:**
Despite the issues with the function definition and parameter handling, the logic inside the function is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and input format. Therefore, the program is correct in terms of its logic and output.

Correctness: **True**
