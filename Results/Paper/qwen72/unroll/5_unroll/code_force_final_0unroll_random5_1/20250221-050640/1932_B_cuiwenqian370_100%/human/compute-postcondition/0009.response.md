The function `func_1` should accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The list `a` represents the periodicities of the signs, and `n` represents the number of signs. The list `a` should contain exactly `n` elements, and each element `a_i` should be a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, but the number of test cases `t` is not directly passed to the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. It returns a value based on the periodicities of the signs in the list `a`, which contains exactly `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).**
