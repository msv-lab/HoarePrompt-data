You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. However, the provided function definition is incorrect and should be updated to `def func_1(a, n):`. Additionally, `a` should contain exactly `n` elements, and each element `a_i` should be a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, but the number of test cases `t` is not directly passed to the function.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        last_year = a[0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        
        results.append(str(last_year))
        
    #State: `index` is `2 + T * (n + 1)`, `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is a list containing `T` strings, each representing the last year calculated for each iteration of the loop.
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and writes the results to standard output. Each test case involves a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`, where `a` contains exactly `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, the function calculates the last year when all signs in the list `a` align based on their periodicities and appends this year as a string to a results list. After processing all test cases, the function writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the list.
   - It reads the number of test cases `T` from the first element of the list.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes `last_year` to the periodicity of the first sign `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left( \left( \text{last\_year} + 1 \right) + a[i] - 1 \right) // a[i] \times a[i]
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, it appends the result for each test case to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it writes the results to the standard output, each on a new line.

### Verification with Example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `6 3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - `last_year` starts at 3.
  - For `a[1] = 2`, the next year is `(3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`.
  - For `a[2] = 4`, the next year is `(4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`.
  - For `a[3] = 5`, the next year is `(8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`.
  - For `a[4] = 9`, the next year is `(10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`.
  - For `a[5] = 18`, the next year is `(18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`.
  - Output: `36`

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `5 1 2 3 4 5`
  - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `last_year` starts at 1.
  - For `a[1] = 2`, the next year is `(1 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 2`.
  - For `a[2] = 3`, the next year is `(2 + 1 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 3`.
  - For `a[3] = 4`, the next year is `(3 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 4`.
  - For `a[4] = 5`, the next year is `(4 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 5`.
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `5 1 1 1 1 1`
  - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `last_year` starts at 1.
  - For each subsequent sign, the next year is always the next integer.
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `6 50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - `last_year` starts at 50.
  - For `a[1] = 30`, the next year is `(50 + 1 + 30 - 1) // 30 * 30 = 60`.
  - For `a[2] = 711`, the next year is `(60 + 1 + 711 - 1) // 711 * 711 = 711`.
  - For `a[3] = 200`, the next year is `(711 + 1 + 200 - 1) // 200 * 200 = 800`.
  - For `a[4] = 503`, the next year is `(800 + 1 + 503 - 1) // 503 * 503 = 1006`.
  - For `a[5] = 1006`, the next year is `(1006 + 1 + 1006 - 1) // 1006 * 1006 = 2012`.
  - Output: `2012`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the input and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case. The logic and the formula used are correct and match the problem description.
