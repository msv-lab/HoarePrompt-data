Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. However, the provided function definition is incorrect and should be updated to `def func_1(a, n):`. Additionally, `a` should contain exactly `n` elements, and each element `a_i` should be a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, but the number of test cases `t` is not directly passed to the function.**
