Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem. Let's break down the issues and validate the original assessment with the provided function summary and the problem requirements.

1. **Logic Issue**:
   - The program splits the string `expression` by the character `'-'`. This approach is fundamentally flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.
   - The problem requires splitting the array into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of times the balance goes below zero and adds one if the final balance is positive. This does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty.

2. **Specific Case**:
   - For the input `expression = "+-+-+"`, the optimal split would be `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1])`, which results in a total penalty of `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - However, the provided program will split the string differently:
     - `parts = expression.split('-')` results in `['+', '', '+', '', '+']`.
     - `result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))` results in `1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3`.
     - `func_1("+-+-+", 3)` will calculate the balance and count the number of times it goes below zero:
       - Balance changes: `1, 0, 1, 0, 1`.
       - Count of balance going below zero: `0`.
       - Final balance: `1`.
       - Return value: `0 + (1 > 0) = 1`.
   - The program's output is `3`, which is incorrect.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary describes `func_1` as returning the number of times the balance goes below zero plus one if the final balance is positive. This does not match the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty.
   - The function does not consider the length of the subarrays or the absolute value of their sums, which are crucial for calculating the penalty.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem.

Final: **False**
