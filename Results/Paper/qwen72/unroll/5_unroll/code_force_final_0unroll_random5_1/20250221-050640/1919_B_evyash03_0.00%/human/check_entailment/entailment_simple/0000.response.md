### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to split the array `a` (derived from the string `s`) into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The optimal strategy is to split the array in such a way that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible, because the penalty is minimized when the sum is zero.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `expression` (which consists of '+' and '-' characters).
   - It then calls `func_1` with the `expression` and `length`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `count` to 0 and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the `expression`:
     - If the character is '+', it increments the `balance` by 1.
     - If the character is '-', it decrements the `balance` by 1.
     - If the `balance` goes below 0, it increments `count` by 1 and resets `balance` to 0.
   - After the loop, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`, which means:
     - `count` is the number of times the `balance` went below 0.
     - If the final `balance` is greater than 0, it adds 1 to the `count`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the number of times the `balance` goes below 0, which corresponds to the number of subarrays with a negative sum.
   - If the final `balance` is greater than 0, it means there is one more subarray with a positive sum that needs to be accounted for.
   - The program does not consider the length of the subarrays, but it correctly calculates the minimum number of subarrays needed to ensure the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For a string like `+`, the `balance` will be 1, and the function will return 1, which is correct.
   - For a string like `-----`, the `balance` will go below 0 five times, and the function will return 5, which is correct.
   - For a string like `+-+-+-`, the `balance` will never go below 0, and the function will return 0, which is correct.
   - For a string like `--+++++++`, the `balance` will go below 0 twice, and the final `balance` will be 7, so the function will return 3, which is correct.
   - For a string like `+---++++-+++++---++-`, the `balance` will go below 0 four times, and the final `balance` will be 0, so the function will return 4, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty for each test case based on the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
