Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem. Here are the issues and a specific case where the program fails:

1. **Logic Issue**: The program splits the string `expression` by the character `'-'`, which is not the correct approach for determining the optimal split. The problem requires splitting the array into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The current logic does not consider the optimal way to split the array.

2. **Specific Case**: Consider the input `expression = "+-+-+"`. According to the problem, the optimal split would be `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1])`, which results in a total penalty of `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`. However, the provided program will split the string differently and will not produce the correct result.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the specific case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  +-+-+
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```
- Actual Output from the provided program:
  ```
  3
  ```

The program incorrectly calculates the penalty by splitting the string in a way that does not minimize the total penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
