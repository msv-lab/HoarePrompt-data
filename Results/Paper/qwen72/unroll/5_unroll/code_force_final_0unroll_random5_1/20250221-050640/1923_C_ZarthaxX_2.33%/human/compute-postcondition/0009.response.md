Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries `q`. It reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q` from input, followed by the array `c`. The function then computes two auxiliary arrays: `ones`, which tracks the cumulative count of 1s in `c` up to each index, and `sum`, which tracks the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `c` and 1. For each query, defined by indices `l_i` and `r_i`, the function checks a specific condition involving the count of 1s and the sum of differences within the subarray from `l_i` to `r_i`. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, and the auxiliary arrays `ones` and `sum` remain unchanged after the function concludes. **
