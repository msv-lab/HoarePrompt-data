Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `n` and `q` are assigned the values from the input, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

The code initializes a new list `sum` with a length of `n + 1`, where each element is 0. The values of `nums`, `n`, `q`, and `ones` remain unchanged.
