### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`testCases`).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - It reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It reads the array `nums` of length `n`.
   - It initializes two lists: `ones` and `sum` with length `n + 1`. These lists are used to store prefix sums:
     - `ones[i]` stores the number of 1s in the subarray `nums[0:i]`.
     - `sum[i]` stores the sum of the values `nums[j] - 1` for `j` in the range `0:i`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix sums for `ones` and `sum`:
     - `ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)` updates the count of 1s.
     - `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` updates the sum of values minus 1.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - If `l == r`, it prints 'NO' because a subarray of length 1 cannot be good (it cannot satisfy the condition `a_i \neq b_i` for every index).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of 1s in the subarray `c[l-1:r]` and the sum of the subarray values minus 1.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if the subarray is good:
     - `2 * onesInRange` accounts for the minimum sum needed to replace all 1s with a different positive integer.
     - `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange` accounts for the sum needed to replace all other elements with a different positive integer.
     - The total sum needed should be less than or equal to the sum of the subarray values minus 1.

5. **Correctness of the Condition:**
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` simplifies to `r - l + 1 + onesInRange <= sumInRange`.
   - This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray can be distributed in such a way that each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in `a` and all elements in `b` are positive.
   - The condition is derived from the fact that each 1 in the subarray needs at least 2 units of sum to be replaced with a different positive integer, and each non-1 element needs at least 1 unit of sum to be replaced with a different positive integer.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code confirms that the prefix sums are calculated correctly.
- The annotated code also confirms that the query handling and the condition checking are implemented as intended.
- The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is correctly applied and simplifies to the expected form.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.

Final: **True**
