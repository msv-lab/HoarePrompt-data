The function `func_1` is designed to process multiple test cases, each including an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries `q`. The array `c` has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and each element `c_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). The number of queries `q` is also a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5). Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries `q`. For each query, it returns the result of processing the subarray of `c` defined by the start and end indices `l_i` and `r_i`. The exact nature of the processing is not specified, but it is assumed to be consistent across all queries. If the input parameters do not meet the specified constraints, the function's behavior is undefined.**
