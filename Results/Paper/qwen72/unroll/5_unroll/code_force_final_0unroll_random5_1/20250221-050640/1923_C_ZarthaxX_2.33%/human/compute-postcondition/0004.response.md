The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 1.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `n` and `q` are assigned the values from the input, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
