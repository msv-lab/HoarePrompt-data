You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and returns a new string `ans` where the characters from `s` are rearranged in the order of increasing depth of the parentheses sequence, starting from the shallowest to the deepest. The original string `s` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input string is a balanced parentheses sequence but the balanced shuffle operation is not applied correctly. Specifically, the program does not sort the columns of the table in increasing order of prefix balance, breaking ties in decreasing order of position. Instead, it sorts the positions in increasing order of prefix balance, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. The correct balanced shuffle should be `()(()())`, but the program outputs `(()(()))`, which is the same as the input. This is because the program does not correctly handle the tie-breaking rule (decreasing order of position).

Here is the correct behavior for the given example:

- Input: `(()(()))`
- Prefix balance: `0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1`
- Position: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8`
- Character: `( ( ) ( ( ) ) )`

After sorting in increasing order of prefix balance and breaking ties in decreasing order of position:

- Prefix balance: `0 1 1 1 2 2 2 3`
- Position: `1 8 4 2 7 5 3 6`
- Character: `( ) ( ( ) ( ) )`

The correct output should be `()(()())`, but the program outputs `(()(()))`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
