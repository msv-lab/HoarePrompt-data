### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the string `s` of length `n`.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function calculates the midpoint `mid` of the string `s` as `n // 2`.
   - It initializes counters for the number of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the midpoint.

3. **Counting Initial Splits**:
   - The function counts the number of '0's and '1's in the first half of the string and the second half of the string.
   - These counts are stored in `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`.

4. **Adjusting Left Split**:
   - The function then tries to move the split point to the left from the midpoint.
   - It adjusts the counts of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides as it moves the split point.
   - It stops moving left when the conditions for the left and right sides are satisfied.

5. **Adjusting Right Split**:
   - The function then tries to move the split point to the right from the midpoint.
   - It adjusts the counts of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides as it moves the split point.
   - It stops moving right when the conditions for the left and right sides are satisfied.

6. **Determining the Optimal Split**:
   - The function checks if the split point can be at the beginning (left = 0) or the end (right = n).
   - If the split point is at the beginning, it checks if the right side satisfies the condition.
   - If the split point is at the end, it checks if the left side satisfies the condition.
   - If both sides are valid, it chooses the split point that is closest to the midpoint.

7. **Output**:
   - The function prints the optimal split point for each test case.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Correctness of Conditions**:
  - The conditions for the left and right sides are correctly implemented using the counts of '0's and '1's.
  - The function ensures that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.

- **Optimal Split Point**:
  - The function correctly tries to find the split point that is closest to the midpoint.
  - It handles edge cases where the split point can be at the beginning or the end of the string.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function correctly handles cases where the entire village can be declared as one side.
  - It also handles cases where the split point is exactly at the midpoint.

### Conclusion:

The function appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the optimal split point based on the problem description. It processes the input, calculates the necessary counts, and outputs the correct split point for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
