The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used within the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
