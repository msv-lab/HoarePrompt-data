Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the square's corners.

2. **Coordinate Extraction**: The program extracts the x-coordinates from the list of points `a` and stores them in the list `x`.

3. **Side Length Calculation**: The side length of the square is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). Since the square is guaranteed to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes, this calculation is valid. The same difference would be obtained if the y-coordinates were used instead.

4. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is correctly calculated as `dx * dx` and printed.

5. **Loop and Variable Overwriting**: The loop correctly processes each test case independently. The variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` are overwritten in each iteration, but this is expected and does not affect the correctness of the program.

6. **Guaranteed Valid Input**: The problem guarantees that the input will always form a valid square with positive area, so the program does not need to handle invalid input cases.

Given the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
