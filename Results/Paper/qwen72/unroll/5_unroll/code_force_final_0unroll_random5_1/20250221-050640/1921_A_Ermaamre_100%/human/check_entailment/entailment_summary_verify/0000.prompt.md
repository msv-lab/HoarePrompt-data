You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

Example

    1 2
    
    4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 2
    
    -1 1
    
    1 -1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 -1
    
    45 11
    
    45 39
    
    17 11
    
    17 39

Output

    9
    4
    784

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        print(dx * dx)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four tuples of coordinates (x_i, y_i) from the input, where each tuple represents a corner of a square. The function calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the corners, and then prints the area of the square, which is the square of the side length. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the input test cases are processed and the areas of the squares are printed. The internal variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` are overwritten in each iteration of the loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the square is defined by coordinates that do not have a simple max and min difference for both x and y coordinates. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
1 1
1 3
3 1
3 3
```

The expected output is `4` (since the side length of the square is `2` and the area is `2 * 2 = 4`). However, the program will output `4` as well, but it does so by only considering the x-coordinates and assuming the square's side length is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates. This assumption is incorrect because the side length should be the same for both x and y coordinates.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check both the x and y coordinates to ensure the side length is consistent. If the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates is not equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates, the program should return an error or handle this case appropriately.
