Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` only counts the number of pairs of cards you have and adds 1 to the score for each pair. However, this approach does not consider the optimal strategy of Nene, who will always play to maximize her score and minimize yours.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following:

1. **Count the pairs in your hand**: Determine how many pairs of each card you have.
2. **Optimal Play Strategy**: Since Nene plays optimally, she will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours. If you have a pair of a card, you can score 1 point by playing the first card and then playing the second card after Nene has played her card. If you have only one card of a certain number, Nene will play her card of the same number before you to maximize her score.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(a, n)
    results.append(result)
for res in results:
    print(res)

def func_1(a, n):
    count_a = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in count_a:
            count_a[num] += 1
        else:
            count_a[num] = 1
    
    # Count the number of pairs in your hand
    pairs = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if num in count_a and count_a[num] == 2:
            pairs += 1
        elif num in count_a and count_a[num] == 1:
            # If you have only one card of a certain number, Nene will play her card first
            pass
    
    # Calculate the maximum score you can get
    max_score = pairs
    return max_score
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Count the pairs**: The program correctly counts the number of pairs of cards you have.
- **Optimal Play**: The program assumes that if you have a pair, you can score 1 point by playing the first card and then the second card after Nene has played her card. If you have only one card of a certain number, Nene will play her card first, and you will not score a point for that number.

This approach ensures that you are taking into account Nene's optimal play strategy, which is crucial for solving the problem correctly.
