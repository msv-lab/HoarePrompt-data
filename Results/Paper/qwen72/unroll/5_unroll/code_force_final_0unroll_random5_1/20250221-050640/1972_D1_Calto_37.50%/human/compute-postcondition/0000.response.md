The only variable in the loop head is `b`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= m, where `m` is a positive integer. Since `b` is already a positive integer, it is non-zero, and the loop can execute without any adjustments.

State: **a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers.**
