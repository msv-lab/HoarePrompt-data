t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and k is a list of n integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
