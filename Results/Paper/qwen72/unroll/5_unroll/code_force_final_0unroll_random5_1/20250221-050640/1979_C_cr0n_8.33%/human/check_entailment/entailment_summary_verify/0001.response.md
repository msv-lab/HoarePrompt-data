### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is called within the loop, which is a valid approach. While it is not a common practice to define the function after the loop, it does not affect the correctness of the program as long as the function is defined before it is called.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**:
   - The program reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals` for each outcome correctly using `int(input().strip())` and list comprehension.

3. **Calculating the Product**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `prod` correctly with a loop that multiplies each value in `vals`.

4. **Calculating the Bets**:
   - The program calculates the bets for each outcome using `vprod = [prod // r for r in vals]`. This step is intended to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   - The logic behind this calculation is to distribute the coins such that the product of all multipliers divided by each individual multiplier gives a bet amount. This ensures that the sum of the bets is `sum(vprod)`, and the amount received for the i-th outcome is `prod`.

5. **Denominator Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `den = prod - sum(vprod)`. This is supposed to check if the sum of the bets is less than the product of the multipliers.
   - If `den <= 0`, the program outputs `-1`, indicating no valid solution. This check is necessary to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

6. **Outputting the Bets**:
   - If a valid solution is found, the program outputs the bets. The bets calculated using `vprod = [prod // r for r in vals]` are intended to satisfy the condition that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Key Insight**:
  - The product `prod` of all multipliers is a common multiple of all the multipliers.
  - By dividing `prod` by each multiplier `r` to get `vprod[i]`, the program ensures that the amount received for the i-th outcome is `prod`, which is the same for all outcomes.
  - The sum of the bets `sum(vprod)` should be strictly less than `prod` for the solution to be valid.
  - The check `den = prod - sum(vprod)` ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If all multipliers are the same, the sum of the bets will be `prod / k * n`, where `k` is the common multiplier and `n` is the number of outcomes. For this to be less than `prod`, `n` must be less than `k`, which is always true given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 20).
  - If the multipliers are different, the sum of the bets will be `sum(prod // r)`, which is always less than `prod` because each `prod // r` is a smaller integer than `prod`.

- **Conclusion**:
  - The program's logic for calculating the bets and the check for the total amount of coins bet being strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome is correct.
  - The program handles all edge cases and constraints correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and satisfies the problem requirements. The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the logic for calculating the bets does not ensure the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. The program's approach is valid and meets the necessary conditions.
