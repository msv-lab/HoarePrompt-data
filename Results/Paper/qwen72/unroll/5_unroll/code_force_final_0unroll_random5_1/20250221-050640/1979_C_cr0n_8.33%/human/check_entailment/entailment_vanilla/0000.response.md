Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case. However, the function `func_1` is called within the loop, which is not a common practice. Typically, the function should be defined first, and then called within the loop.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, the program reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals` for each outcome. This is done correctly using `int(input().strip())` and list comprehension.

3. **Calculating the Product**: The program calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`. This is done correctly with a loop that multiplies each value in `vals`.

4. **Calculating the Bets**: The program then calculates the bets for each outcome using `vprod = [prod // r for r in vals]`. This step is intended to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome. However, this approach is not correct because it does not guarantee that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received for each possible winning outcome.

5. **Denominator Calculation**: The program calculates `den = prod - sum(vprod)`. This is supposed to check if the sum of the bets is less than the product of the multipliers. If `den <= 0`, the program outputs `-1`, indicating no valid solution. This check is not sufficient to ensure the correctness of the bets.

6. **Outputting the Bets**: If a valid solution is found, the program outputs the bets. However, the bets calculated using `vprod = [prod // r for r in vals]` do not necessarily satisfy the condition that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

### Correctness:
The program is **incorrect** because the logic for calculating the bets does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. The approach of using `prod // r` for each bet does not guarantee that the sum of the bets is less than the product of the multipliers, which is a necessary condition for the problem.

Correctness: **False**
