Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible values of \(X\). Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of \(X = 1\)**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \(X = 1\) correctly. For \(X = 1\), the only array that has exactly one increasing subsequence is an array with a single element. However, the program does not check for this case and will incorrectly output an empty array or an array that does not meet the criteria.

2. **Incorrect Construction of the Array**:
   - The program attempts to construct the array by alternating between adding the maximum and minimum values, but this approach does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will match \(X\). For example, the program might output an array that does not have the correct number of increasing subsequences for certain values of \(X\).

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not print \(-1\) when it is impossible to find the required array. Instead, it always prints an array, which is incorrect for some values of \(X\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to construct an array that has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. One possible approach is to use a combination of distinct elements and repeated elements to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        if x == 1:
            print(1)
            print(0)
        elif x == 2:
            print(2)
            print(0, 1)
        else:
            # Initialize the array with a single element
            ans = [0]
            while x > 1:
                if x % 2 == 0:
                    ans.append(ans[-1] + 1)
                    x = x // 2
                else:
                    ans.append(ans[-1])
                    x -= 1
            print(len(ans))
            print(*ans)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Base Cases**:
  - If \(X = 1\), the array with a single element (e.g., `[0]`) has exactly one increasing subsequence.
  - If \(X = 2\), the array with two distinct elements (e.g., `[0, 1]`) has exactly two increasing subsequences: `[0]` and `[0, 1]`.

- **General Case**:
  - The program initializes the array with a single element `[0]`.
  - It then iteratively adds elements to the array to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences:
    - If \(X\) is even, it adds a new distinct element to the array, which doubles the number of increasing subsequences.
    - If \(X\) is odd, it adds a duplicate of the last element, which increases the number of increasing subsequences by 1.
  - The program continues this process until \(X\) is reduced to 1.

This approach ensures that the array has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences and meets the problem's constraints.
