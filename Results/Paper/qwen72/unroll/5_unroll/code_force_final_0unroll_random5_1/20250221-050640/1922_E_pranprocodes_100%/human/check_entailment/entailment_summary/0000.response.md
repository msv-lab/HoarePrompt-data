Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing an array of integers that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, where `X` is an integer provided in the input. The program attempts to solve this by reducing `X` to 1 through a series of operations, appending values to a list `ans` based on whether `X` is even or odd. The values appended are `max` (a large positive number, starting from 100000000 and decrementing) when `X` is even, and `min` (a large negative number, starting from -100000000 and incrementing) when `X` is odd. After `X` is reduced to 1, the list `ans` is reversed and printed.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Handling of Even and Odd `X`**:
   - When `X` is even, the program appends a large positive number and divides `X` by 2. This is intended to reduce the number of increasing subsequences by half, which is a valid approach.
   - When `X` is odd, the program appends a large negative number and subtracts 1 from `X`. This is intended to reduce the number of increasing subsequences by 1, which is also a valid approach.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the length of the array `t` and then the array itself. This is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `X` is 1 correctly. According to the problem, if `X` is 1, the array should have exactly one increasing subsequence, which is the empty subsequence. The program should print `-1` in this case, but it does not.
   - The program does not handle the case where `X` is 2 correctly. The simplest array that has exactly 2 increasing subsequences is `[0, 1]`, but the program may not generate this.

4. **General Correctness**:
   - The logic of appending large positive and negative numbers to reduce `X` to 1 is not guaranteed to produce an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach of reducing `X` by half or by 1 does not necessarily correspond to the correct number of increasing subsequences in the generated array.

5. **Constraints**:
   - The program does not ensure that the length of the array is at most 200, which is a requirement of the problem. If `X` is very large, the length of `ans` could exceed 200.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all cases as it does not always produce the required array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences, and it may violate the length constraint.

Correctness: **False**
