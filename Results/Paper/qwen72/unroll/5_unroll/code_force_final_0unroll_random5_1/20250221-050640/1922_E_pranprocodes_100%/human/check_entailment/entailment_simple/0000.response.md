### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x` which represents the number of increasing subsequences required.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function initializes `max` and `min` to the values `100000000` and `-100000000` respectively, which are within the allowed range for array elements.
   - It also initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the array and a counter `t` to keep track of the length of the array.

3. **Loop to Construct the Array:**
   - The function enters a loop that continues until `x` is reduced to 1.
   - If `x` is even, it appends the current value of `max` to `ans`, decrements `max`, and divides `x` by 2.
   - If `x` is odd, it appends the current value of `min` to `ans`, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from `x`.
   - The counter `t` is incremented in each iteration to keep track of the number of elements added to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints the length of the array `t`.
   - It then prints the elements of `ans` in reverse order.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The function aims to construct an array such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `x`.
   - By appending `max` when `x` is even and `min` when `x` is odd, the function ensures that the array elements are distinct and can form the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The use of `max` and `min` ensures that the elements are within the allowed range.
   - The loop correctly reduces `x` to 1, and the length of the array `t` is at most 200 because the loop will not run more than 200 times for any valid `x` (since `x` is at most \(10^{18}\) and the loop reduces `x` by at least 1 in each iteration).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `x` is 2 by appending a single element to `ans` and then printing it.
   - The function handles larger values of `x` by constructing the array step by step, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `x`.

7. **Verification:**
   - The provided example outputs match the expected outputs for the given inputs.
   - The function correctly constructs arrays that have the required number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by constructing an array that has exactly `x` increasing subsequences for each test case. The logic is sound, and the constraints are respected.

Correctness: **True**
