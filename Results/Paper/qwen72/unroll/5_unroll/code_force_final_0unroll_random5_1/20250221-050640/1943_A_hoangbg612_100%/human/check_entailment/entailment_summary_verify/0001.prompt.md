You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        cnt = []
        for k in M.keys():
            if M[k] == 1:
                cnt.append(k)
        if len(cnt) >= 2:
            cur = cnt[1]
        print(cur)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `S` and a list `N` of `S` integers. For each test case, it prints the second smallest unique element in the sorted list `N` if there are at least two unique elements. If there are fewer than two unique elements, it prints the largest unique element in the list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `S`, `N`, `M`, and `cnt` are reset for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they alternately pick elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice's goal is to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob's goal is to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case starts with an integer `n` (size of the array `a`), followed by `n` integers.
   - The output is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each element in `N`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this means the MEX has been found.
     - If `num` is exactly `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys in `M` that have a count of 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - The optimal strategy involves both players picking the smallest available element that is not already in `c`.

5. **Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly sorts the array and uses a dictionary to track the counts of elements.
   - The loop correctly identifies the MEX by checking if the current element is greater than the expected MEX value.
   - The logic to increment `cur` and break the loop when the MEX is found is correct.
   - The final check and update of `cur` based on the counts in `M` is intended to handle edge cases, but it seems to be an overcomplication.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where the array `N` contains all elements from 0 to `n-1` (MEX would be `n`).
   - It should also handle cases where the array `N` contains duplicates and gaps.

7. **Simplified Logic:**
   - The program can be simplified by directly finding the MEX after sorting the array and removing duplicates.
   - The optimal strategy can be implemented by ensuring that Alice and Bob pick elements in a way that the MEX is determined correctly.

### Correctness:
The program has some logical issues and overcomplications that may not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, the final checks and updates of `cur` based on the counts in `M` are not necessary and may lead to incorrect results.

**Correctness: **False****

### Corrected Program:
Here is a simplified and corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N = sorted(set(N))  # Remove duplicates and sort
        cur = 0
        for num in N:
            if num == cur:
                cur += 1
            else:
                break
        print(cur)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This version correctly identifies the MEX by removing duplicates, sorting the array, and finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array.
