Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `T` is an input integer.**
