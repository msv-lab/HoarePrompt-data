Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the MEX by iterating through the sorted array and using a dictionary `M` to track the counts of each number. However, the logic for determining the MEX is flawed.
   - The program breaks out of the loop as soon as it finds a number that is greater than `cur + 1`, which is not the correct way to determine the MEX. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array.
   - The program also incorrectly increments `cur` and checks the sum of the dictionary values, which does not align with the game's rules or the MEX calculation.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Bob's Turn**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle Bob's turn. It only considers Alice's actions, which is insufficient for determining the final score when both players play optimally.
   - Bob's strategy should be to minimize the MEX, and this is not reflected in the program.

3. **Incorrect Final MEX Calculation**:
   - The final MEX calculation is incorrect. The program tries to find the second smallest number in the array that appears only once, which is not the correct approach to determine the MEX after both players have played optimally.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem, both players need to play optimally. Here's a correct approach:

- **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX. She should always choose the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and is available in `a`.
- **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX. He should choose the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and is available in `a`, but if that number is the same as what Alice would choose, he should choose the next smallest number.

Given the constraints, the optimal strategy can be simplified:

- If the array `a` contains all numbers from `0` to `n-1`, the MEX will be `n` because all numbers are present.
- If the array `a` is missing the number `0`, the MEX will be `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer.
- If the array `a` contains `0` but is missing some number `k` where `1 <= k < n`, the MEX will be `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        
        # Initialize MEX to 0
        mex = 0
        
        # Iterate through the sorted array to find the MEX
        for num in N:
            if num == mex:
                mex += 1
        
        # If the array length is even, Bob can always choose the next smallest number
        if S % 2 == 0:
            print(mex)
        else:
            # If the array length is odd, Alice gets the last turn and can choose the next smallest number
            print(mex + 1)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, read the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - Initialize `mex` to `0`.
   - Iterate through the sorted array `N`. If the current number `num` is equal to `mex`, increment `mex`.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - If the length of the array `S` is even, Bob can always choose the next smallest number, so the final MEX is `mex`.
   - If the length of the array `S` is odd, Alice gets the last turn and can choose the next smallest number, so the final MEX is `mex + 1`.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally and the MEX is calculated correctly.
