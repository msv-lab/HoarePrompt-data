Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**:
   - The original program's logic for calculating the MEX is indeed flawed. The program increments `cur` and breaks the loop if `num > cur + 1`, which is not the correct way to calculate the MEX. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `c`.

2. **Handling of Single Occurrences**:
   - The program attempts to handle cases where elements occur only once by appending them to `cnt` and then setting `cur` to the second element in `cnt` if there are at least two elements. This logic is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal strategy for both players. It simply picks the second smallest unique element, which does not align with the game's rules.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob correctly. It does not ensure that Alice and Bob are making the best possible moves to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively. For example, Alice should always pick the smallest element that appears exactly once, and Bob should pick the smallest element that appears more than once.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
The expected output is `1` because Alice and Bob will play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively. However, the program will output `2` due to its incorrect logic for MEX calculation and handling of single occurrences.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game by considering the optimal moves for both players. Here is a correct approach:

1. **Count the Frequency of Each Element**:
   - Use a frequency array to count how many times each element appears in the array `a`.

2. **Simulate the Game**:
   - Alice and Bob will take turns picking elements. Alice will always pick the smallest element that appears exactly once (to maximize the MEX), and Bob will pick the smallest element that appears more than once (to minimize the MEX).

3. **Calculate the MEX**:
   - After the game ends, calculate the MEX of the array `c` by finding the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `c`.

The provided corrected version of the program correctly implements this approach:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        freq = [0] * S
        for num in N:
            freq[num] += 1
        
        c = []
        for i in range(S):
            if freq[i] == 1:
                c.append(i)
                freq[i] = 0
            elif freq[i] > 1:
                freq[i] -= 1
        
        cur = 0
        while cur < S and cur in c:
            cur += 1
        
        print(cur)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly simulates the game and calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the game's rules and fails to calculate the MEX correctly. The issues identified in the original assessment are valid, and the provided example case demonstrates the program's failure.

Final: **False**
