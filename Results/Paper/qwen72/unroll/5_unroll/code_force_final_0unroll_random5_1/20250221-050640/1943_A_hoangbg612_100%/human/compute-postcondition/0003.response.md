The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases without explicitly accepting any arguments. Each test case involves an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of an array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns the result of processing each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the result of processing each test case, where `n` is the size of the list `a`, and each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
