### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `N` is sorted, which is a good approach to simplify the process of finding the MEX.

3. **Tracking Unique Elements**:
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1` to keep track of the current MEX.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each element in `N`.

4. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The loop iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` to the next unique element if it is greater than `cur`.
   - If an element is greater than `cur + 1`, the loop breaks, indicating that `cur + 1` is the MEX.

5. **Optimal Play**:
   - The program attempts to find the MEX by ensuring that both Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The logic of breaking the loop when an element is greater than `cur + 1` is correct because it ensures that the smallest missing integer is found.

6. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in `N` are unique and cover the range from `0` to `S-1`, the program correctly increments `cur` to `S` (or `S-1` if `S` is not included).
   - The program also handles cases where there are fewer than two unique elements by printing the largest unique element.

7. **Output**:
   - The final value of `cur` is printed for each test case, which should represent the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly handle the optimal play strategy for both Alice and Bob. The current logic only finds the MEX of the sorted array `N` and does not account for the alternating turns and the strategic choices of Alice and Bob.
- The dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences, but the logic for updating `cur` and handling the counts is not optimal for the game's rules.
- The variable `cnt` is used to store unique elements with a count of 1, but the logic for setting `cur` to the second smallest unique element is not correct for the game's rules.

### Correct Approach:
- Alice and Bob should play optimally, which means Alice will always try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
- The game's score can be determined by the parity of the number of unique elements in `N`. If the number of unique elements is even, Bob can always ensure that the MEX is the smallest missing integer. If it is odd, Alice can ensure that the MEX is the next smallest missing integer.

### Correctness:
- The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players.
- The logic for finding the MEX and handling the counts is flawed.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
