### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they alternately pick elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice's goal is to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob's goal is to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case starts with an integer `n` (size of the array `a`), followed by `n` integers.
   - The output is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each element in `N`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this means the MEX has been found.
     - If `num` is exactly `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys in `M` that have a count of 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - The optimal strategy involves both players picking the smallest available element that is not already in `c`.

5. **Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly sorts the array and uses a dictionary to track the counts of elements.
   - The loop correctly identifies the MEX by checking if the current element is greater than the expected MEX value.
   - The logic to increment `cur` and break the loop when the MEX is found is correct.
   - The final check and update of `cur` based on the counts in `M` is intended to handle edge cases, but it seems to be an overcomplication.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where the array `N` contains all elements from 0 to `n-1` (MEX would be `n`).
   - It should also handle cases where the array `N` contains duplicates and gaps.

7. **Simplified Logic:**
   - The program can be simplified by directly finding the MEX after sorting the array and removing duplicates.
   - The optimal strategy can be implemented by ensuring that Alice and Bob pick elements in a way that the MEX is determined correctly.

### Correctness:
The program has some logical issues and overcomplications that may not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, the final checks and updates of `cur` based on the counts in `M` are not necessary and may lead to incorrect results.

**Correctness: **False****

### Corrected Program:
Here is a simplified and corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N = sorted(set(N))  # Remove duplicates and sort
        cur = 0
        for num in N:
            if num == cur:
                cur += 1
            else:
                break
        print(cur)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This version correctly identifies the MEX by removing duplicates, sorting the array, and finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array.
