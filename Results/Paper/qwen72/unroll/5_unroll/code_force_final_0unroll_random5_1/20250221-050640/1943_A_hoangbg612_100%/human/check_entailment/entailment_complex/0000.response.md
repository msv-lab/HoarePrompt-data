Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the MEX of an array `c` that is constructed by Alice and Bob playing optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest possible integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest possible integer that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX, but he will not pick the smallest integer if it is the only one left that can help Alice increase the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the optimal picking strategy.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, which will track the current MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each element in `N`.
   - The loop iterates through each element in `N` and updates `cur` and `M` accordingly:
     - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is the next expected integer (`cur + 1`). If it is, it updates `cur` and `M`.
     - If `num` is not the next expected integer, it breaks the loop, as this means the MEX is `cur + 1`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. If it does, it increments `cur` by 1, which is incorrect because the MEX should be the smallest integer not in `c`, not necessarily the largest unique element.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` where the count is 1.
   - If there are at least two unique elements in `cnt`, it sets `cur` to the second smallest unique element.
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

4. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The logic for updating `cur` and breaking the loop is flawed. The program should not break the loop just because `num` is not the next expected integer. Instead, it should continue to find the smallest integer that is not in `c`.
   - The final check `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S` and the subsequent increment of `cur` is incorrect. This check is unnecessary and does not align with the MEX definition.
   - The logic for setting `cur` to the second smallest unique element in `cnt` is also incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest integer not in `c`, not necessarily the second smallest unique element.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would be to iterate through the sorted array and keep track of the smallest integer that is not yet in `c`. This integer will be the MEX at the end of the game.

Given the issues in the program, the current implementation does not correctly compute the MEX for the array `c` as required by the problem.

Correctness: **False**
