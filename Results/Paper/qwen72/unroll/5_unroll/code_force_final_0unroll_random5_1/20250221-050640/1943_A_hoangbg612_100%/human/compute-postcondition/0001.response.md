The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the integer `T`. The loop will execute if `T` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used within the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state of `func` and the details about `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
