### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves `n` containers of water, each with a specific amount of water.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, ensuring that a target amount of water per container can be calculated.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the operation of pouring water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The target amount of water in each container should be `sum(nums) / n`.
   - The operation allows water to be moved only to the right, which means we need to ensure that the water can be balanced by pouring from left to right.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The correct approach is to check if the sum of the water in all containers is evenly distributed.
   - If the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, and the water can be moved to the right to balance the containers, then the answer should be "YES".
   - If the water cannot be balanced by pouring to the right, the answer should be "NO".

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `nums`.
   - The program then calculates the difference between each container's water and the last container's water.
   - It sums these differences and checks if the sum is zero.
   - If the sum is zero, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the last container's water amount is the target amount for all containers.
   - The correct target amount should be `sum(nums) / n`.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the last container's water amount is not the target amount.
   - The program's logic of summing differences from the last element is flawed and does not align with the problem's requirements.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the target amount of water per container: `target = sum(nums) / n`.
   - Check if the sum of the differences between each container's water and the target amount is zero. This can be done by ensuring that the total water can be evenly distributed among the containers.
   - If the total water can be evenly distributed and the operation constraints are met, the answer should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the target amount of water for each container and does not properly check if it is possible to balance the containers by pouring water to the right.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
