You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It then checks if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums` is zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the output for each test case is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition described. The variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` are used internally and are not returned or modified outside the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operations. Specifically, the logic in the program is flawed:

1. The program calculates the difference between each element in the list and the last element (`last = nums[-1]`), and sums these differences in `curr`.
2. It then checks if `curr` is zero to decide the output.

This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the average amount of water that each container should have after the operations. The correct approach should involve calculating the average amount of water (`sum(nums) // n`) and checking if it is possible to redistribute the water such that each container has this average amount.

### Counterexample:
Consider the test case:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
- The sum of the water amounts is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, and `n = 3`.
- The average amount of water each container should have is `6 // 3 = 2`.

The correct answer should be "YES" because it is possible to redistribute the water to make each container have 2 units of water:
- Pour 1 unit from the third container to the first container: `1 2 2` -> `2 2 2`.

However, the program will output "NO" because it calculates `curr` as follows:
- `last = 3`
- `curr = (1 - 3) + (2 - 3) + (3 - 3) = -2 + -1 + 0 = -3`
- Since `curr` is not zero, the program outputs "NO".

This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected, hence the correctness is **False**.
