The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It then checks if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums` is zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the output for each test case is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition described. The variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` are used internally and are not returned or modified outside the function.
