### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - Each character in the string corresponds to an element in an array `a` where `+` maps to `1` and `-` maps to `-1`.
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - It initializes two counters `P` and `M` to count the number of `+` and `-` characters, respectively.
   - It iterates through the string, incrementing `P` for `+` and `M` for `-`.
   - Finally, it prints `P - M`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string.
   - However, the program does not actually calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem.
   - The penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.
   - The program simply prints the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters, which does not correspond to the penalty calculation required by the problem.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `+`, the program outputs `1`, which is incorrect because the minimum penalty is `1` (as the sum of the subarray `[1]` is `1` and its length is `1`).
   - For the input `-----`, the program outputs `-5`, which is incorrect because the minimum penalty is `5` (as the sum of each subarray `[-1]` is `-1` and its length is `1`).
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the program outputs `0`, which is incorrect because the minimum penalty is `0` (as the sum of each subarray `[1, -1]` is `0` and its length is `2`).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as required by the problem. It only calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters, which is not the same as the penalty calculation. The original assessment is accurate in identifying this issue.

Final: **False**
