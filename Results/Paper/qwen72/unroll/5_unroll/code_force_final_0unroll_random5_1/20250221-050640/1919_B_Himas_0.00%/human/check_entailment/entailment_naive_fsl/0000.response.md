Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

The program calculates the penalty as the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is `P - M`. However, the problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array. For the input `+-+-+-`, the optimal split would be `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a total penalty of `0 + 0 = 0`. The program does not handle the splitting logic and thus does not produce the correct output for this case.
