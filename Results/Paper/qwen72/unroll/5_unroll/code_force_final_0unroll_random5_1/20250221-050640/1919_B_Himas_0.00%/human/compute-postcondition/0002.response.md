The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) and a string `s` consisting only of '+' and '-' characters, where the length of `s` is equal to `n`.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function evaluates the string `s` and returns a specific value based on the evaluation.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case.**
