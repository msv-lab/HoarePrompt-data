Reasoning:  
The program provided is not correct based on the problem description. The task is to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into subarrays. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. However, the program simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and prints this difference. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty, and thus it does not solve the problem correctly.

For example, in the third test case where `s = "+-+-+-"`, the optimal way to split the array is `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, which results in a penalty of 0. The program, however, would output `1 - 1 = 0`, which is the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, but it does not follow the correct method to calculate the penalty as described in the problem.

Correctness: **False**
