Reasoning:

The problem requires us to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome. This means that for each outcome \( i \), the condition \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i \) must hold, where \( x_j \) is the bet on the \( j \)-th outcome and \( k_i \) is the multiplier for the \( i \)-th outcome.

### Analysis of the Functions:

1. **func_1(a, b):**
   - This function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It is used to find the LCM of all the multipliers \( k_i \) in the list.

2. **func_2(numbers):**
   - This function computes the LCM of all the integers in the list `numbers`.
   - It iterates through the list and uses `func_1` to compute the LCM of the current result and the next number in the list.
   - The final result is the LCM of all the multipliers \( k_i \).

### Main Program Logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( n \) and the list of multipliers \( k \).

2. **Computing Bets:**
   - The program computes the LCM of all the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It then distributes the coins such that the bet on the \( i \)-th outcome is \( m // k_i \), where \( m \) is the LCM of all multipliers.

3. **Checking Validity:**
   - The program checks if the total amount of coins bet \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) is strictly less than \( m \).
   - If the condition is not met, it prints \(-1\).
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome.

### Correctness Check:

- **LCM Calculation:**
  - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total bet is a multiple of the LCM.
  - This is a good approach because it ensures that the bets are consistent with the multipliers.

- **Distribution of Bets:**
  - The bets \( x_i \) are calculated as \( m // k_i \), which ensures that the bet for each outcome is an integer and is proportional to the multiplier.
  - The condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < m \) must be checked to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the LCM.

- **Output:**
  - If the condition is met, the program prints the bets.
  - If the condition is not met, the program prints \(-1\).

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - \( k = [3, 2, 7] \)
  - \( m = \text{LCM}(3, 2, 7) = 42 \)
  - Bets: \( x_1 = 42 // 3 = 14 \), \( x_2 = 42 // 2 = 21 \), \( x_3 = 42 // 7 = 6 \)
  - Total bet: \( 14 + 21 + 6 = 41 \)
  - Winning outcomes: \( 3 \cdot 14 = 42 \), \( 2 \cdot 21 = 42 \), \( 7 \cdot 6 = 42 \)
  - The condition \( 41 < 42 \) is met, so the output is correct.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - \( k = [3, 3] \)
  - \( m = \text{LCM}(3, 3) = 3 \)
  - Bets: \( x_1 = 3 // 3 = 1 \), \( x_2 = 3 // 3 = 1 \)
  - Total bet: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \)
  - Winning outcomes: \( 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \), \( 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \)
  - The condition \( 2 < 3 \) is met, so the output is correct.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - \( k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] \)
  - \( m = \text{LCM}(5, 5, 5, 5, 5) = 5 \)
  - Bets: \( x_1 = 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( x_2 = 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( x_3 = 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( x_4 = 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( x_5 = 5 // 5 = 1 \)
  - Total bet: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 \)
  - Winning outcomes: \( 5 \cdot 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \cdot 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \cdot 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \cdot 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \cdot 1 = 5 \)
  - The condition \( 5 < 5 \) is not met, so the output is \(-1\).

- **Test Case 4:**
  - \( k = [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13] \)
  - \( m = \text{LCM}(7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13) = 1989 \)
  - Bets: \( x_1 = 1989 // 7 = 284 \), \( x_2 = 1989 // 9 = 221 \), \( x_3 = 1989 // 3 = 663 \), \( x_4 = 1989 // 17 = 117 \), \( x_5 = 1989 // 9 = 221 \), \( x_6 = 1989 // 13 = 153 \)
  - Total bet: \( 284 + 221 + 663 + 117 + 221 + 153 = 1659 \)
  - Winning outcomes: \( 7 \cdot 284 = 1988 \), \( 9 \cdot 221 = 1989 \), \( 3 \cdot 663 = 1989 \), \( 17 \cdot 117 = 1989 \), \( 9 \cdot 221 = 1989 \), \( 13 \cdot 153 = 1989 \)
  - The condition \( 1659 < 1989 \) is met, so the output is correct.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - \( k = [6, 3, 2] \)
  - \( m = \text{LCM}(6, 3, 2) = 6 \)
  - Bets: \( x_1 = 6 // 6 = 1 \), \( x_2 = 6 // 3 = 2 \), \( x_3 = 6 // 2 = 3 \)
  - Total bet: \( 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \)
  - Winning outcomes: \( 6 \cdot 1 = 6 \), \( 3 \cdot 2 = 6 \), \( 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \)
  - The condition \( 6 < 6 \) is not met, so the output is \(-1\).

- **Test Case 6:**
  - \( k = [9, 4, 6, 8, 3] \)
  - \( m = \text{LCM}(9, 4, 6, 8, 3) = 72 \)
  - Bets: \( x_1 = 72 // 9 = 8 \), \( x_2 = 72 // 4 = 18 \), \( x_3 = 72 // 6 = 12 \), \( x_4 = 72 // 8 = 9 \), \( x_5 = 72 // 3 = 24 \)
  - Total bet: \( 8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24 = 71 \)
  - Winning outcomes: \( 9 \cdot 8 = 72 \), \( 4 \cdot 18 = 72 \), \( 6 \cdot 12 = 72 \), \( 8 \cdot 9 = 72 \), \( 3 \cdot 24 = 72 \)
  - The condition \( 71 < 72
