The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of integers where each integer \( k_i \) is in the range \( 2 \le k_i \le 20 \). The function returns the product of all integers in the `numbers` list, and the list `numbers` remains unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` where each integer is between 2 and 20, and returns the product of all integers in the list. The list `numbers` remains unchanged.**
