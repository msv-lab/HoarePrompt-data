Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It then computes a list `p` of the same length as `a`, where each element `p[i]` is calculated based on the minimum excluded value (MEX) of the list `p` starting from `n` and updating as the loop progresses. The final list `p` is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `t` and `n` are unchanged after the function execution, and the list `a` is also unchanged. **
