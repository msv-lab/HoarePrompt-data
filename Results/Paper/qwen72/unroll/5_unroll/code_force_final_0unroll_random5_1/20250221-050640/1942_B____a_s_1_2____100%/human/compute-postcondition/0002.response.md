Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, the list `p` is computed such that each element `p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]` where `mex` is the minimum excluded value (MEX) of the list `p` starting from `n` and updating as the loop progresses. The final value of `mex` for each test case is the smallest value in the list `p`. The list `p` is printed for each test case. The variables `t` and `n` are unchanged, and the list `a` is unchanged for each test case.**
