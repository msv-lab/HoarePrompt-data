Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the MEX of the array changes in a way that the current `mex` value is not the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array. Specifically, the program initializes `mex` to `n` and updates it by taking the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` in each iteration. This approach can lead to incorrect results if the MEX of the array is not correctly tracked.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
The expected output is:
```
0 1 2 3 4
```
However, the program will output:
```
4 3 2 1 0
```
This is incorrect because the MEX of the array should be updated correctly to reflect the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array, and the program fails to do this properly.
