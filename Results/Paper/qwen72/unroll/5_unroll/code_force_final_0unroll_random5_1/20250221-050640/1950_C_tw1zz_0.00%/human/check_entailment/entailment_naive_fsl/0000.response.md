Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is 12 correctly for PM. According to the problem description, 12:00 in 24-hour format should be 12:00 PM in 12-hour format, but the program incorrectly sets the time to 12:00 AM for the input "12:00". This is a clear violation of the problem requirements.
