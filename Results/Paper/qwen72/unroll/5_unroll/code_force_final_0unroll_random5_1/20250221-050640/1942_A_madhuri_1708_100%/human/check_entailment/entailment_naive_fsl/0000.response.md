Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails when \( k = 1 \) and \( n > 1 \). According to the problem description, there should be exactly one sorted cyclic shift when \( k = 1 \). However, the program prints a sequence of integers from 1 to \( n \) when \( k = 1 \), which results in more than one sorted cyclic shift.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 1
```
The program will output:
```
1 2 3
```
The cyclic shifts of this array are:
- [1, 2, 3] (sorted)
- [2, 3, 1] (not sorted)
- [3, 1, 2] (not sorted)

Here, there is only one sorted cyclic shift, which is correct. However, the program also incorrectly outputs `-1` for cases where \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n \neq k \), which is not always correct. For example, for the input:
```
4 2
```
The program will output:
```
-1
```
However, a valid solution exists, such as:
```
1 2 3 1
```
The cyclic shifts of this array are:
- [1, 2, 3, 1] (sorted)
- [2, 3, 1, 1] (sorted)
- [3, 1, 1, 2] (not sorted)
- [1, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted)

In this case, there are exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts, which meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
