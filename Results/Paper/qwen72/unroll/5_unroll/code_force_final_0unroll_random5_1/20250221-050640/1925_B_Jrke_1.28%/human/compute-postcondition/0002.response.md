The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information. However, we can infer that the function likely performs some computation or check involving these parameters and returns a result accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts three positive integers `t`, `x`, and `n`, where `t` is between 1 and 10^3, `x` is between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is between 1 and `x`. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
