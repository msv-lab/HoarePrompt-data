The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `x` and `n` from the input. The function then calculates the largest odd divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, where `k = x // n`. If `k` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the largest odd divisor found. The function performs this operation for each of the `t` test cases.
