Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and a positive integer `n`, where `1 <= n <= 10^5` and each element `a_i` in `a` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. The function processes the list and returns a result based on the input. If the function is intended to handle multiple test cases, it should be called within a loop that iterates over the number of test cases `t`, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`.**
