Output State: `n` remains the same, `arr` remains the same, `prefix` remains the same, `pre` is now a list containing 32 sublists, each of which has been updated based on the bitwise operations performed on `prefix[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. Specifically, for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `pre[j][1]` contains the count of 1s and `pre[j][0]` contains the count of 0s at that bit position across all `prefix[i]` values. `suf` is now a list containing 32 sublists, each of which has been updated such that all counts are zero. `ans` is the final computed value after all iterations of the loop.
