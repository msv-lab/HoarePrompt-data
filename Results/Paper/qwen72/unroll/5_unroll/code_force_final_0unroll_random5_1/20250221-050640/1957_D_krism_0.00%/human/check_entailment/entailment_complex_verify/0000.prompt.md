You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array and the number of elements in the array, such as `def func_1(a, n):`, where `a` is a list of integers and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and each element `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so the actual function might need to be called within a loop that iterates over the number of test cases `t`, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.

Specifically, for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of 1s and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of 0s at that bit position across all `prefix[i]` values.

Specifically, for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `pre[j][1]` contains the count of 1s and `pre[j][0]` contains the count of 0s at that bit position across all `prefix[i]` values. `suf` is now a list containing 32 sublists, each of which has been updated based on the bitwise operations performed on `prefix[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. Specifically, for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` and `suf[j][0]` are both 0. `ans` is the final computed value after all iterations of the loop.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the final computed value after all iterations of the loop, derived from the counts of 0s and 1s at each bit position in the `pre` list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the user. It then computes a prefix XOR list `prefix` where each element at index `i` is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0. The function also maintains two lists, `pre` and `suf`, each containing 32 sublists to count the occurrences of 0s and 1s at each bit position (from 0 to 31) in the prefix XOR values. After processing, the function calculates a final integer `ans` based on these counts and prints `ans`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `arr` remain unchanged, `prefix` contains the cumulative XOR values, `pre` contains the updated counts of 0s and 1s at each bit position, and `suf` has all counts set to 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n\) and \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\). The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Tuples**: The program attempts to count tuples based on the bit positions and the prefix and suffix counts, but this approach does not correctly capture the condition \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\). The logic for updating `pre` and `suf` arrays and calculating the number of valid tuples is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Initialization of `pre` Array**: The `pre` array is initialized with `pre[i][0] += 1` for all `i` in the range 32, which is incorrect. This initialization does not reflect the actual prefix XOR values.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`**: The calculation of `ans` using `pre` and `suf` arrays is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The program does not correctly handle the XOR operations and the comparison \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\).

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
6 2 4
```
The expected output is 4, as described in the problem statement. However, the provided program will not produce the correct output due to the issues mentioned above.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
1. Compute the prefix XOR array.
2. Iterate over all possible tuples (x, y, z) and check the condition \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\).
3. Count the number of valid tuples that satisfy the condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:
```python
def count_tuples(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = test_cases[_][0]
        arr = test_cases[_][1]
        prefix = [0]
        for v in arr:
            prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
        
        ans = 0
        for x in range(1, n + 1):
            for y in range(x, n + 1):
                for z in range(y, n + 1):
                    f_x_y = prefix[y] ^ prefix[x-1]
                    f_y_z = prefix[z] ^ prefix[y-1]
                    f_x_z = prefix[z] ^ prefix[x-1]
                    if f_x_y ^ f_y_z > f_x_z:
                        ans += 1
        results.append(ans)
    return results

# Example usage
t = 3
test_cases = [
    (3, [6, 2, 4]),
    (1, [3]),
    (5, [7, 3, 7, 2, 1])
]

results = count_tuples(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected program will produce the correct output for the given examples.
