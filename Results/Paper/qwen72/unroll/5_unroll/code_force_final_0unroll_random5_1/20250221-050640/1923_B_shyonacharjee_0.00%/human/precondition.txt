The function `solve` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, representing the number of monsters and the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, respectively. Additionally, each test case includes two lists of integers: `a` (health of the monsters) and `x` (initial positions of the monsters), where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n with x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
