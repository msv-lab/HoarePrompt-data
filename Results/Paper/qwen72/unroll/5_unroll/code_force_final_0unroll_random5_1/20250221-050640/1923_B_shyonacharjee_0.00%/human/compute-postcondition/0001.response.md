The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. According to the given state, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable**
