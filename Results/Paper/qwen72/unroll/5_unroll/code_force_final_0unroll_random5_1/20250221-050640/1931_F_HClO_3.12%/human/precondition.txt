t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each case in cases is a tuple (n, k, screenshots) where n is the number of chat participants, k is the number of participants who posted screenshots, and screenshots is a list of k lists, each containing n distinct integers (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n) representing the order of participants as seen by the participant a_{i0}. It is guaranteed that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5, and all the authors of the screenshots are different.
