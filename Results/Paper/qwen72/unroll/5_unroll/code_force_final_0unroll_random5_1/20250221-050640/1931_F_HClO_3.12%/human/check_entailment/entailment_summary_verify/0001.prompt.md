You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n people in the programming contest chat. Chat participants are
ordered by activity, but each person sees himself at the top of the list.

For example, there are 4 participants in the chat, and their order is [2, 3,
1, 4] . Then

  * 1 -st user sees the order [1, 2, 3, 4] . 
  * 2 -nd user sees the order [2, 3, 1, 4] . 
  * 3 -rd user sees the order [3, 2, 1, 4] . 
  * 4 -th user sees the order [4, 2, 3, 1] . 

k people posted screenshots in the chat, which show the order of participants
shown to this user. The screenshots were taken within a short period of time,
and the order of participants has not changed.

Your task is to determine whether there is a certain order that all
screenshots correspond to.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains two integers n
and k (1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, n \cdot k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted
screenshots.

The following k lines contain descriptions of screenshots posted by the
participants.

The i -th row contains n integers a_{ij} each (1 \le a_{ij} \le n , all a_{ij}
are different) — the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0} ,
where a_{i0} — the author of the screenshot. You can show that in the
screenshot description it will always be at the top of the list.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot k for all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . It is also guaranteed that all the authors of the screenshots
are different.

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
an answer, output "YES" if there exists at least one order of participants,
under which all k screenshots could have been obtained. Otherwise, output
"NO".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of chat participants `n` and the number of participants who posted screenshots `k`. For each test case, it reads `k` lines of input, each containing `n` integers that represent the order of participants shown to the author of the screenshot. The function checks if the order of participants, excluding the author of the screenshot, is consistent across all screenshots. If the order is consistent, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function consumes the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, and the participant order lists, and does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.
   - It handles the case where `m == 1` by directly printing "yes" and continuing to the next test case, as a single screenshot is always consistent with itself.

2. **Initial Comparisons**:
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and extracts the user IDs `a1` and `a2` and the lists of other participants `l1` and `l2`.
   - It creates two filtered lists `l11` and `l22` by removing `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2`, respectively.
   - If `l11` and `l22` are not equal, it prints "no" and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if the lists of other participants are not the same after removing the user IDs, the screenshots cannot be consistent with each other.

3. **Finding the Insertion Point**:
   - The program initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1 and `p1` and `p2` to 0.
   - It iterates through the lists `l1` and `l2` to find the first position where they differ.
   - If the differing elements are `a2` and `a1` respectively, it sets `idx1` and `idx2` to the current index and breaks the loop.
   - If only one of the differing elements is found, it sets the corresponding index and increments the position pointer (`p1` or `p2`).
   - If both indices are found, it breaks the loop.

4. **Constructing the Consistent List**:
   - If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, it inserts `a2` into `l2` at position `idx1` and uses `l2` as the consistent list.
   - If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, it inserts `a1` into `l1` at position `idx2` and uses `l1` as the consistent list.
   - If `idx1` equals `idx2`, it reads the third screenshot and uses the position of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` to decide which list to use.

5. **Verifying Remaining Screenshots**:
   - The program reads the remaining screenshots and stores them in a list `val`.
   - For each remaining screenshot, it checks if the list of other participants (after removing the user ID) matches the consistent list.
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints "no" and breaks the loop.
   - If all screenshots match, it prints "yes".

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `m == 2` by directly comparing the two screenshots and deciding the consistent list.
   - It correctly handles the case where `n == 1` and `m == 1` by printing "yes".

7. **Complexity**:
   - The program efficiently processes the input within the given constraints, ensuring that the total number of operations does not exceed the limits.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the order of participants is consistent across all screenshots.
