Output State: **The loop will iterate `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, the loop will read `n` and `k`, and then read `k` lines of integers representing the order of participants. After processing, the loop will print either 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, indicating whether the conditions specified in the code are met. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and the input lists will be consumed, and the loop will move on to the next test case until all `t` test cases have been processed.**
