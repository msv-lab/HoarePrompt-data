You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. Each of the following k lines contains n integers a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, all a_{ij} are different), representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, who is the author of the screenshot and always appears at the top of the list. The sum of n · k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and all authors of the screenshots are different.

    #State: The loop will iterate `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, the loop will read `n` and `k`, and then read `k` lines of integers representing the order of participants. After processing, the loop will print either 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, indicating whether the conditions specified in the code are met. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and the input lists will be consumed, and the loop will move on to the next test case until all `t` test cases have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each with the number of chat participants `n` and the number of participants who posted screenshots `k`. It also processes `k` lines of input for each test case, each containing `n` integers representing the order of participants shown to the author of the screenshot. The function returns the result of processing these inputs for each test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
