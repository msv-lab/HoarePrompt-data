To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `index` is 1, and `data` is a list of strings, but these are not directly part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data`.
- The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be explicitly stated.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, `data` is a list of strings where each string is an element from the input split by whitespace**
