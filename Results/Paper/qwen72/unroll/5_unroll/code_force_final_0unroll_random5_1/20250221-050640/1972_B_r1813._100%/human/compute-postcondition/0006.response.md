The function `func_1` is described with a context that it should accept two parameters: a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. However, the provided function signature does not include these parameters, and there is no information about the return value or the cases in which different outputs are produced.

Given the constraints and the typical structure of such a function, I will assume the function signature should be `def func_1(n, s):` and proceed based on that assumption.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The function is designed to be called multiple times for different test cases, with the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) provided externally. The function returns a value based on the initial state of the coins, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
