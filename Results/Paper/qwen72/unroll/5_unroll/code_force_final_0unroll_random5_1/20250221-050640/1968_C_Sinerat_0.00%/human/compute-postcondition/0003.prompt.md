You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` should accept a list of integers `x` where `1 <= len(x) <= 500` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 500
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: For each test case, the function prints a list `a` where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the input list `x` up to that index, starting from the first element of `x`. The variables `t` and `x` remain unchanged, and `n` and `a` are reset for each new test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `x` and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the elements in the list, ensuring that the constraints `1 <= len(x) <= 500`, `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`, and `1 <= t <= 10^4` are met, with the sum of values `n` over all test cases not exceeding `2 * 10^5`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
