Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the conditions specified in the problem description correctly. Specifically, the program initializes `a[0]` to 500, which is a fixed value and does not necessarily satisfy the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \). The correct approach should be to initialize `a[0]` to a value that ensures the modulo conditions are met for all subsequent elements in the array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = x[0] + 1  # Initialize a[0] to a value that is greater than x[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)
```

Explanation:
- `a[0]` is initialized to `x[0] + 1` to ensure that \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = x_2 \).
- For each subsequent element \( a_i \), it is set to \( a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \) to ensure that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \).

This approach guarantees that the conditions are met for all elements in the array.
