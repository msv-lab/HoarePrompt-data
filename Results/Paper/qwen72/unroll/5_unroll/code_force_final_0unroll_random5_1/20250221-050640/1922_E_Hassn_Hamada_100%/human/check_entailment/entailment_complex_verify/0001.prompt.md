You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It modifies `sequence` by appending a series of integers and always returns the tuple (0, 0). The final state of the program is such that `sequence` contains a sequence of integers that are generated based on the input `number`, and `number` is reduced through recursive calls until it reaches a value that no longer satisfies the condition `(1 << size) - (1 << overlap) <= number`. The length of `sequence` is at most 200, and all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9].


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is defined as a sequence where the elements are strictly increasing.
   - If no such array exists, the program should output \(-1\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and calls the function `func_1` to generate the sequence.
   - The length of the generated sequence is printed, followed by the sequence itself.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has exactly \( n \) increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - The function iterates over possible values of `i` and calculates the number of increasing subsequences that can be generated with a given length and overlap.
   - It appends elements to the sequence and recursively calls itself to handle the remaining number of subsequences.

4. **Key Points**:
   - The program uses bitwise operations to calculate the number of increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence is built by appending elements in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences is controlled.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle the case where the number of increasing subsequences is reduced by the value of the current subsequence.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the case where \( n \) is 1 (which is not possible since \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \)).
   - The program should handle the case where \( n \) is very large and ensure the sequence length does not exceed 200.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly uses bitwise operations to calculate the number of increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence is built in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( n \).
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

However, there is a potential issue in the program:
   - The function `func_1` is not defined to handle the case where \( n \) is 1, which is not possible according to the problem constraints. This might lead to incorrect behavior.
   - The function `func_1` should return \(-1\) if it is impossible to generate the required sequence.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where \( n \) is 1, which is not possible according to the problem constraints. Additionally, the function `func_1` should return \(-1\) if it is impossible to generate the required sequence, but it does not do so. This can lead to incorrect output for some test cases.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the program, we need to ensure that the function `func_1` correctly handles the edge case where \( n \) is 1 and returns \(-1\) if it is impossible to generate the required sequence.

```python
import sys
from typing import Any, List

stdin = sys.stdin
stdout = sys.stdout
test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(test_cases):
    n = int(input())
    result = list()
    if not func_1(n - 1, result):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(result))
        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(number: int, sequence: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns:
        bool: True if the sequence is generated, False otherwise
    """
    assert number >= 0
    if number == 0:
        return True
    size_overlap = (0, 0)
    for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
        size = i + 1
        value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)
        while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
            size += 1
            value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)
        if value <= number:
            size_overlap = (size, i)
            break
    else:
        return False  # No valid size_overlap found
    (size, overlap) = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
    return func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
```

This fix ensures that the program correctly handles the edge cases and returns \(-1\) when it is impossible to generate the required sequence.
