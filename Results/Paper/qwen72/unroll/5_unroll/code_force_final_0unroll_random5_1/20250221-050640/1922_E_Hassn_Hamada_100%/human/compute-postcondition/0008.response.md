The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `size - overlap`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `size - overlap`. If `size - overlap` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state must ensure that `size - overlap` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`size` is the largest integer such that `(1 << size) - (1 << overlap) <= number`, `overlap` is the corresponding index `i` from the loop, `size_overlap` is a tuple (size, i), `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged, `size - overlap` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
