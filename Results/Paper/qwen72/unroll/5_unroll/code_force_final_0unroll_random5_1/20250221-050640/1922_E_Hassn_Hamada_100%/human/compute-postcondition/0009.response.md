Output State: **`size` remains the largest integer such that `(1 << size) - (1 << overlap) <= number`, `overlap` remains the corresponding index from the loop, `size_overlap` remains a tuple (size, overlap), `number` remains unchanged, and `sequence` is updated to contain the integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`.**
