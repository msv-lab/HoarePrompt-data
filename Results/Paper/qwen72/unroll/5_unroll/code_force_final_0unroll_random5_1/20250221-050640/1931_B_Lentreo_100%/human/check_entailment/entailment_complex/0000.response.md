Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. The key insight is that if the sum of the water amounts is divisible by the number of containers, and if we can ensure that no container ever has less water than the target amount (the mean), then it is possible to equalize the water amounts.

The function `func_1` follows these steps:
1. It calculates the total amount of water and checks if the total is divisible by the number of containers. If not, it returns 'NO'. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant.
2. It calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have.
3. It iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative deviation `curr` from the mean.
4. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than the mean, and it is not possible to pour water from a higher-indexed container to make up for this deficit. In this case, the function returns 'NO'.
5. If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it means that the water can be redistributed to achieve the mean in all containers, and the function returns 'YES'.

The function's logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. The cumulative deviation `curr` ensures that the water can be poured from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed containers without any container ever having less water than the mean.

However, the function's comment suggests that it is checking whether it is possible to make all elements in the list equal to the mean by only adding or subtracting the same value from each element, which is not the case. The function is actually checking the feasibility of redistributing water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed containers to achieve the mean.

Given the problem constraints and the function's implementation, the function will correctly determine whether it is possible to equalize the water amounts in the containers.

Correctness: **True**
