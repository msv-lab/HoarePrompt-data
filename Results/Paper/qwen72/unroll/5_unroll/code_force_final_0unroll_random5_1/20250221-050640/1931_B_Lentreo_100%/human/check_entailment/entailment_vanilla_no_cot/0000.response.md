Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `nums`.

2. **Sum and Mean Calculation**: The program calculates the total amount of water in all containers and checks if the total is divisible by `n`. Since the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, this check is always true and can be omitted. However, it is included for completeness.

3. **Mean Calculation**: The program calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have after the operations, which is `total // n`.

4. **Feasibility Check**: The program iterates through the containers and maintains a running sum `curr` of the differences between the current amount of water in each container and the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the containers to the left to balance the containers to the right, making it impossible to equalize the water levels. If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it means the water can be balanced.

5. **Output**: The program outputs "YES" if it is possible to equalize the water levels and "NO" otherwise.

The logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
