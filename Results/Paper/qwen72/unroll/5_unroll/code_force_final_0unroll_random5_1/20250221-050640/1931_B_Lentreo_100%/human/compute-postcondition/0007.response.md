The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `curr` being 0, `total` being the sum of the integers in `nums`, and `mean` being `total // n` does not directly affect the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list, `n` is equal to the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `total % n` is equal to 0, `mean` is equal to `total // n`, `curr` is 0, `i` is 0**
