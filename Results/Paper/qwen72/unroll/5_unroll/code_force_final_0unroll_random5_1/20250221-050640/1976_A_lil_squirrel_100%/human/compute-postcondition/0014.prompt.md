You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string password, and digits is a list containing all the digits from the string password. The variable n remains unchanged.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string password, and digits is a list containing all the digits from the string password. The variable n remains unchanged. The list letters is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string password, and digits is a list containing all the digits from the string password. The variable n remains unchanged. The list letters is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list digits is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: The loop does not modify the lists `letters` or `digits`, and the variable `n` remains unchanged. The loop checks for the condition where a letter is followed by a digit in the string `password`. If this condition is met at any point, the function returns 'NO'. If the loop completes all iterations without finding such a pattern, the function will not return anything explicitly, and the output state will be the same as the initial state.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES' if the loop completes all iterations without finding a letter followed by a digit in the string `password`. If a letter is followed by a digit at any point, the function returns 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` (1 <= n <= 20) consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It returns 'NO' if any letter in the `password` is followed by a digit. If no such sequence is found, it returns 'YES'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'YES' if the loop completes all iterations without finding a letter followed by a digit in the string `password`. If a letter is followed by a digit at any point, the function returns 'NO'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
