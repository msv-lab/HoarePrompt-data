    #State: letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string password, and digits is a list containing all the digits from the string password.

            return 'NO'
        
    #State: The loop does not modify the lists `letters` or `digits`, and the variable `n` remains unchanged. The loop checks for the condition where a letter is followed by a digit in the string `password`. If this condition is met at any point, the function returns 'NO'. If the loop completes all iterations without finding such a pattern, the function will not return anything explicitly, and the output state will be the same as the initial state.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES' if the loop completes all iterations without finding a letter followed by a digit in the string `password`. If a letter is followed by a digit at any point, the function returns 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` (1 <= n <= 20) consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It returns 'NO' if any letter in the `password` is followed by a digit, or if the letters or digits in the `password` are not in non-decreasing order. If no such sequences or order issues are found, it returns 'YES'. The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
