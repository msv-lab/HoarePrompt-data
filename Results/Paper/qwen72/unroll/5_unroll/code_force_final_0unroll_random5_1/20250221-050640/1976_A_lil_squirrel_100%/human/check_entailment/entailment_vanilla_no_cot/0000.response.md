Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Separation of Characters**: The program separates the characters in the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.

3. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order and if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Order of Characters**: The program checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter in the password. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Final Return**: If all conditions are met, the program returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
