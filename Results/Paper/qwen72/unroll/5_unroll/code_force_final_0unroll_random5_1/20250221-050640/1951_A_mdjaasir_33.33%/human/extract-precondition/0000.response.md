It seems there's a misunderstanding in the provided problem. The function definition you've given is `def func():`, but the problem description and the code snippet suggest a different function, `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`. To provide an accurate precondition, I'll base it on the function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` as described in the problem.

Function definition:
```
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that 0 <= start <= end.**
