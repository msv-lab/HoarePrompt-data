Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Movement Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The movement function `func_1` is defined to move the player, but it does not handle the movement of the Quaffle correctly. The Quaffle should move to the middle of the field when a goal is scored, but this is not implemented in the program.

2. **Goal Scoring Logic**:
   - The program checks if the player is in a goal and increments the score accordingly. However, it does not handle the case where a player scores in the wrong goal (i.e., a red player scores in a red goal or a blue player scores in a blue goal). In such cases, the other team should win the point, but the program does not account for this.

3. **Quaffle Positioning**:
   - The program does not keep track of the Quaffle's position. It only checks if a player is in a goal, but it does not verify if the player is carrying the Quaffle. This is crucial for determining if a goal is scored.

4. **Catching the Quaffle**:
   - The program does not implement the logic for catching the Quaffle. The `C` action is not handled, which means the program cannot correctly determine when a player has the Quaffle.

5. **Quaffle Reset**:
   - When a goal is scored, the Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field, but this is not implemented in the program.

### Corrected Program:
To make the program correct, it should include the following changes:

- Track the Quaffle's position.
- Implement the logic for catching the Quaffle.
- Handle the case where a player scores in the wrong goal.
- Reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field when a goal is scored.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
quaffle_position = (m // 2, n // 2)
player_with_quaffle = None

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..' or s[x] == '.Q':
            continue
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        (x, y) = players[mo[0]]
        (dx, dy) = mouvements[mo[1]]
        players[mo[0]] = (x + dx, y + dy)
        if player_with_quaffle == mo[0]:
            quaffle_position = (x + dx, y + dy)
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        if players[mo[0]] == quaffle_position:
            player_with_quaffle = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        if player_with_quaffle == mo[0]:
            (x, y) = players[mo[0]]
            if (x, y) in goals['R']:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            elif (x, y) in goals['B']:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quaffle_position = (m // 2, n // 2)
            player_with_quaffle = None

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

This corrected program addresses all the issues mentioned and should correctly simulate the game as described in the problem.
