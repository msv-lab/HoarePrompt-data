Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field and initializes a dictionary to store the positions of players and a dictionary to store the positions of goals. It also correctly identifies the positions of the Quaffle and the goals.

2. **Movement Function**: The `func_1` function is intended to handle the movement of players. However, there is a significant issue with the function. The function is supposed to take a tuple `(x, y)` representing the current position of the player and a tuple `(dx, dy)` representing the direction of movement. The function should return the new position `(x + dx, y + dy)`. However, the function incorrectly attempts to unpack `b` (which is a tuple representing the direction) as an integer, leading to a `TypeError`.

3. **Game Loop**: The main game loop correctly iterates through the actions and handles movements and throws. However, it does not handle the catching of the Quaffle, which is a crucial part of the game mechanics. The program also does not update the position of the Quaffle when it is caught or thrown.

4. **Scoring**: The scoring logic is partially correct. It checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score accordingly. However, it does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which should award a point to the opposing team.

5. **Final Score**: The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

Given these issues, the program is **incorrect** because:
- The `func_1` function raises a `TypeError` and does not return the correct new position.
- The program does not handle the catching of the Quaffle.
- The program does not update the position of the Quaffle when it is caught or thrown.
- The scoring logic is incomplete and does not handle own goals correctly.

Correctness: **False**
