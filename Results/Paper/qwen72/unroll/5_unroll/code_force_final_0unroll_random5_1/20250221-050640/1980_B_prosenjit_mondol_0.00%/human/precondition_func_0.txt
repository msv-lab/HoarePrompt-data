The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases)`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list of integers `a` representing the values shown on the cubes. Each `n` is the number of cubes, `f` is the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, `k` is the number of cubes to be removed, and `a` is a list of integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100. Additionally, 1 <= t <= 1000, 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100.
