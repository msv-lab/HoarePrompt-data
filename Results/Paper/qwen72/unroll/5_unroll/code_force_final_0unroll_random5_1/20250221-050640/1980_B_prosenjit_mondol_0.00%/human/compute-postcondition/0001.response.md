Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, the variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are updated based on the input. The value `x` is set to the value of the cube at index `f-1` in the list `a`. The list `a` is then sorted in descending order. The loop checks if the value of the cube at index `k-1` in the sorted list `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `x` and prints 'NO', 'YES', or 'MAYBE' accordingly. After all iterations, the variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.**
