Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the k-th cube after sorting, and there are multiple cubes with the same value. Specifically, the program incorrectly prints "YES" when it should print "MAYBE" in such cases.

Consider the following test case:
```
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
- After sorting, the array can be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`.
- The favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3.
- The k-th cube (index 2) also has a value of 3.

The program will print "YES" because it checks if `a[k] < x` and prints "YES" if this condition is not met. However, the correct output should be "MAYBE" because the favorite cube could be in the first two positions (and thus removed) or in the third position (and thus not removed).

This is a clear case where the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
