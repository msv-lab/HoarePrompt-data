### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - A cyclic shift on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) has a cost of \( r - l + 1 \).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads a binary string `s` from the user.
   - It initializes `n` to 0, which will count the number of '1's encountered.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will accumulate the total cost.
   - The function iterates through each character of the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Test Case Handling**: `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading `t` and iterating `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Cost Calculation in `func_1`**:
     - The function correctly identifies the number of '1's (`n`) before each '0'.
     - The cost for each '0' that is preceded by at least one '1' is calculated as `n + 1`.
     - This is because to move a '0' to its correct position in a sorted string, you need to shift the substring containing the '0' and all preceding '1's. The length of this substring is `n + 1`.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly prints 0.
     - If the string contains no '0's, the function correctly prints 0.
     - If the string contains no '1's, the function correctly prints 0.
   - **Example Verification**:
     - For "10", the function correctly prints 2.
     - For "0000", the function correctly prints 0.
     - For "11000", the function correctly prints 9.
     - For "101011", the function correctly prints 5.
     - For "01101001", the function correctly prints 11.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to handle multiple test cases and compute the correct costs.

Correctness: **True**
