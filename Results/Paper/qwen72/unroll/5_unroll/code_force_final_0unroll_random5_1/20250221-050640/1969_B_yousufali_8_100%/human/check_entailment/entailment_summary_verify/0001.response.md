### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts.
   - A cyclic shift on a substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r \) has a cost of \( r - l + 1 \).

2. **Analyzing the Solution**:
   - **Function 1**:
     - The function processes a single binary string.
     - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered.
     - It initializes `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
     - It iterates through each character of the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **Function 2**:
     - The function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the binary string.

3. **Correctness of Function 1**:
   - The function correctly counts the number of '1's (`n`) and calculates the cost of shifting '0's past '1's.
   - The cost calculation `n + 1` is correct because it accounts for the length of the substring being shifted, which includes the '0' and all the '1's before it.
   - The function prints the total cost for a single test case.

4. **Correctness of Function 2**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates `t` times, each time calling `func_1` to process a new binary string.
   - This ensures that the solution is applied to each test case independently.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly outputs 0.
   - If the string has no '0's or no '1's, the function correctly handles these cases by not adding any cost.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \( O(|s|) \) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is \( O(1) \) for each test case, as it only uses a few variables.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Function 1**:
  - The function does not handle the case where the string is already sorted and does not need any shifts. However, the original assessment correctly states that the function outputs 0 in such cases.
  - The function correctly calculates the cost of shifting '0's past '1's, which is the core of the problem.

- **Function 2**:
  - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case independently.
  - The function does not store the results of each test case, but the problem description only requires printing the results, which the function does correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It handles the input and output format correctly and efficiently computes the minimum total cost for sorting the binary string. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
