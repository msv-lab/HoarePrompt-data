The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from user input. It calculates and prints a value `ans`, which is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in `s` that is preceded by at least one '1', where `n` is the number of '1's encountered before the '0'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the binary string `s` remains unchanged, and the value `ans` is printed to the console.
