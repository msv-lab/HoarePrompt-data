Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly handling all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Movement Function**:
   - The `func_1` function incorrectly updates the player's position. The movement directions are defined as `mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}`, but the function should update the position as `return (x + dx, y + dy)`. The correct implementation should be `return (x + dx, y + dy)`.

2. **Incorrect Ball Catching Logic**:
   - The ball catching logic is incorrect. The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to assign the player who caught the ball.

3. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic**:
   - The goal scoring logic is flawed. The program should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before scoring a goal. The current implementation does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before scoring.
   - The program should also handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly. The current implementation does not handle this case properly.

4. **Bludger Elimination Logic**:
   - The Bludger elimination logic is incorrect. The program should check if the Bludger is present in the field and if it moves to a player's position, the player should be eliminated. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

5. **Quaffle Reset Logic**:
   - The Quaffle reset logic is incorrect. When a goal is scored, the Quaffle should always be reset to the middle of the field, regardless of which team scored. The current implementation does not always reset the Quaffle to the middle.

6. **Bludger Movement Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the movement of the Bludger correctly. The Bludger should be able to move and eliminate players, but the current implementation does not account for this.

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
5
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 L
R0 L
R0 T
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 0
```

The program fails to correctly reset the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, leading to an incorrect final score. Additionally, the program does not handle the Bludger's movement and elimination logic correctly, which could lead to further issues in more complex scenarios.
