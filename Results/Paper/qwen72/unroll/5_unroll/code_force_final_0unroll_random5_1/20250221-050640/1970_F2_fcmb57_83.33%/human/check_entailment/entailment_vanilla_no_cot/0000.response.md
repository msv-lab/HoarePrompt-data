Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
1. **Variable Initialization and Parsing:**
   - The program correctly initializes the players, goals, and movements.
   - The middle of the field is correctly calculated.
   - The initial positions of the players, goals, and the Quaffle are parsed correctly.

2. **Movement Function:**
   - The `func_1` function is used to update the position of the player. However, it incorrectly updates the position by adding the movement to the coordinates. The movement should be applied to the y-coordinate first and then the x-coordinate, or vice versa, depending on the coordinate system used. The current implementation might lead to incorrect movements.

3. **Action Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the movement of players and checks for collisions with the Bludger.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the catching and throwing of the Quaffle. Specifically:
     - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is a comparison, not an assignment. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to assign the player who is carrying the Quaffle.
     - The program does not correctly handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle and it remains in the same cell if the player is eliminated while carrying it.
     - The program does not reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

4. **Scoring Logic:**
   - The scoring logic is partially correct but incomplete. It does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which should award a point to the opposing team.
   - The program does not correctly reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

5. **Final Score Output:**
   - The final score is printed correctly, but the program might not have the correct score due to the issues mentioned above.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
movements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)

# Parse the initial field
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

# Process the moves
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        # Update player position
        (x, y) = players[mo[0]]
        (dx, dy) = movements[mo[1]]
        new_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)
        players[mo[0]] = new_pos

        # Check for collision with Bludger
        if '.B' in players and new_pos == players['.B']:
            print(i, mo[0], 'ELIMINATED')
            if quidditch[1] == mo[0]:
                quidditch[0] = new_pos
                quidditch[1] = ''
            del players[mo[0]]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        # Player catches the Quaffle
        if players[mo[0]] == quidditch[0]:
            quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        # Player throws the Quaffle
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            else:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            else:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle

# Print the final score
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Corrected Movement Function:**
   - The movement function now correctly updates the player's position.
2. **Corrected Catching Logic:**
   - The catching logic now correctly assigns the player who is carrying the Quaffle.
3. **Corrected Throwing Logic:**
   - The throwing logic now correctly handles the Quaffle's position and scoring.
4. **Reset Quaffle Position:**
   - The Quaffle's position is reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
5. **Elimination Logic:**
   - The elimination logic correctly updates the Quaffle's position if the player carrying it is eliminated.

This corrected program should now handle all the cases described in the problem correctly.
