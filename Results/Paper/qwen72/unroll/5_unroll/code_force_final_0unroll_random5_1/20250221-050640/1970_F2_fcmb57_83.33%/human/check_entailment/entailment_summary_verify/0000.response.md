### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and function summary.

1. **Incorrect Movement Function**:
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to update the player's position based on the movement direction. The function correctly unpacks the current position `a` into `x` and `y`, and the movement direction `b` into `dx` and `dy`. The function then returns the new position as `(x + dx, y + dy)`.
   - However, the function summary states that `b` is an integer, which is incorrect. The `mouvements` dictionary correctly maps movement directions to tuples, so `b` is a tuple, not an integer. Therefore, the function `func_1` is actually correct in its implementation.

2. **Incorrect Ball Catching Logic**:
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should indeed be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to assign the player who caught the ball. The original assessment is correct in identifying this issue.

3. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic**:
   - The program should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before scoring a goal. The current implementation does not check this condition.
   - Additionally, the program should handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly. The current implementation does not handle this properly.
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying these issues.

4. **Bludger Elimination Logic**:
   - The Bludger elimination logic is incorrect. The program should check if the Bludger is present in the field and if it moves to a player's position, the player should be eliminated. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying this issue.

5. **Quaffle Reset Logic**:
   - The Quaffle should always be reset to the middle of the field when a goal is scored, regardless of which team scored. The current implementation does not always reset the Quaffle to the middle.
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying this issue.

6. **Bludger Movement Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the movement of the Bludger correctly. The Bludger should be able to move and eliminate players, but the current implementation does not account for this.
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying this issue.

### Specific Issues and Corrections:

- **Ball Catching Logic**:
  - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`.

- **Goal Scoring Logic**:
  - The program should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before scoring a goal.
  - The program should handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly.
  - The Quaffle should always be reset to the middle of the field when a goal is scored.

- **Bludger Elimination Logic**:
  - The program should check if the Bludger is present in the field and if it moves to a player's position, the player should be eliminated.
  - The Bludger should be able to move and eliminate players.

### Corrected Code:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if '.B' in players:
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                    if quidditch[1] == k:
                        quidditch = [v, '']
                    del players[k]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        if quidditch[1] == mo[0]:
            quidditch[1] = ''
            if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
                quidditch[0] = middle
            elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
                quidditch[0] = middle
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment correctly identified multiple issues in the program, including incorrect ball catching logic, goal scoring logic, Bludger elimination logic, and Quaffle reset logic. The provided program does not handle these cases correctly, leading to potential incorrect outputs.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
