Reasoning:

1. **Field Initialization and Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field and initializes the `players`, `goals`, and `quidditch` dictionaries.
   - The `mouvements` dictionary is correctly defined to map the movement commands to their respective changes in coordinates.

2. **Movement Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to update the position of an entity based on a movement command. However, it is incorrectly implemented. The function expects `b` to be a tuple of movements, but it is actually a string ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). This results in a `TypeError` because `b` cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`.

3. **Main Game Loop:**
   - The main loop processes each move correctly, but it relies on the incorrect `func_1` function to update player positions.
   - The logic for catching the Quaffle is incorrect. The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` does not assign the player to the Quidditch state; it should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`.
   - The logic for scoring goals is mostly correct, but it has a minor issue. If a player scores in the wrong goal, the Quidditch should always reset to the middle, regardless of the team. The current implementation only resets to the middle if the player is from the opposing team.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the events and the final score, but due to the issues in the movement function and the catching logic, the positions and states of the entities may be incorrect.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
