Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.** 

The value of `t` has been updated to an integer provided by the user, which must still satisfy the condition 1 <= t <= 10^4. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
