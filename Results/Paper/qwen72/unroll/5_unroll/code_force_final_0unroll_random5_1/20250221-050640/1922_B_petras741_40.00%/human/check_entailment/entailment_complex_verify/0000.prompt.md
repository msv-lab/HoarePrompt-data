You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Output

    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `w` of `n` integers. If `n` is less than 3, the function prints 0. If `n` is 3 or greater, the function calculates and prints the number of unique combinations of three elements from the list `w` that are the same. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the program state with `t` and `n` as input integers, `w` as a list of integers, and `buffer` as an empty list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a potential issue in the way it handles the calculation of the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, the program incorrectly limits the loop to `j > 1000` with a `break` statement, which can prematurely terminate the loop and lead to incorrect results if the number of unique stick lengths exceeds 1000. This is not mentioned in the problem description and can cause the program to fail for certain inputs.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1001
1 2 3 ... 1001
```
In this case, the program will break the loop after processing the 1001st unique stick length, potentially missing valid combinations of sticks that could form a non-degenerate triangle. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
