### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Operation Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array and checks if the array is already sorted using `func_1`.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it replaces the previous element with its digits by popping the element and inserting the digits in the same position.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list `lst` is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself. This is a correct way to check if a list is sorted.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - It also handles the case where the array contains elements less than 10, which do not need to be split.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program only checks and splits elements if the current element is less than the previous element and the previous element is greater than 10. However, it does not consider the possibility that the current element might also need to be split if it is greater than 10.
   - The program does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split in a single pass through the array. For example, if the array is `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will only split `12` and not `28` in the first pass, which might lead to incorrect results.

6. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will split `12` to `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted.
   - For the input `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will only split `12` to `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, which is not sorted. It does not split `28` in the same pass, leading to an incorrect result.
   - For the input `[0, 0]`, the array is already sorted, so the program correctly prints `Yes`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split in a single pass through the array. This can lead to incorrect results in some test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**
