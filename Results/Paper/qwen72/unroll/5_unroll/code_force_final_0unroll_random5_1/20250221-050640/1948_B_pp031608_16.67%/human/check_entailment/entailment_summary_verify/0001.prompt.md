You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers (each between 0 and 99) and returns `True` if the list is already sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It does this by comparing the original list `lst` with its sorted version `sorted_lst`.
   - If the original list is equal to the sorted list, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it iterates over the array `list1` starting from the second element.
   - It checks if the current element `list1[p]` is less than the previous element `list1[p - 1]` and if the previous element is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it performs the operation of splitting the previous element into its digits and inserting them back into the array.
   - After potentially performing the operation, it checks if the array is sorted using `func_1`.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The program only performs the operation once for each pair of elements where the previous element is greater than the current element and is at least 10.
   - This approach is incorrect because the operation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will only split `12` into `[1, 2]` and then check if the array is sorted. However, it should also split `28` into `[2, 8]` to achieve a sorted array.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would be to repeatedly apply the operation to the array until no more elements can be split or the array becomes sorted.
   - This can be achieved by using a loop that continues to apply the operation as long as the array is not sorted and there are elements greater than or equal to 10.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array. It only performs the operation once for each pair of elements, which is insufficient.
