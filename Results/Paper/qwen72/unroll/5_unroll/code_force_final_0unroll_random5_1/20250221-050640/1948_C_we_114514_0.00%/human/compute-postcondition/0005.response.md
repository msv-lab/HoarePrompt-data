Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` with characters '<' and '>'. The function evaluates whether it is possible to move from the first row to the second row in each test case, based on the direction of the arrows. It returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' if the second row is reachable from the first row, or 'NO' otherwise, for each test case. **
