Reasoning: 

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) in a 2xN grid with arrows pointing left or right. The robot moves in two steps each second: first, it moves left, right, down, or up, and then it follows the arrow in the current cell. The program reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the robot can reach (2, n).

However, there are a few issues in the logic of the function `func_1`:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Row Transitions**:
   - The program checks if the robot can move to the second row only when it encounters a `<` in the first row. This is incorrect because the robot can move down to the second row from any cell in the first row, regardless of the arrow direction.
   - The program does not correctly handle the transition from the first row to the second row and back. It should check if the robot can move down to the second row and then continue moving along the second row.

2. **Incorrect Final Check**:
   - The program sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` if the robot reaches the last cell in the first row and the arrow points to the right. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the last cell in the second row.
   - The program should check if the robot can reach the last cell in the second row, not just if it can move to the second row at any point.

3. **Missing Downward Movement**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the downward movement of the robot. The robot should be able to move down from any cell in the first row to the corresponding cell in the second row.

4. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement. The robot should be able to move down to the second row and then continue moving along the second row, and the program should check if the robot can reach the last cell in the second row.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
