To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `test_case` and `test_cases`.

1. **`test_case`**: This is the variable that will hold each element of `test_cases` during the iterations. It does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as it will be assigned values from `test_cases` within the loop.
2. **`test_cases`**: This is the list that the loop will iterate over. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one test case.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even) and two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `results` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop can execute, `test_cases` must have at least one element. The other variables (`t` and `results`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one test case, `results` is an empty list**
