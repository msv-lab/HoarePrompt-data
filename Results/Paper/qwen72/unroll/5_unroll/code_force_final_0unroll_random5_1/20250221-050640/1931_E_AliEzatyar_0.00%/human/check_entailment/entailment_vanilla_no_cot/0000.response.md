Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

1. **Function Naming and Usage**: The function `func_1` is used to count the trailing zeros in a number represented as a string. However, the function is not clearly named to reflect its purpose, and it is not used correctly in the context of the problem. The function should be named something like `count_trailing_zeros` for clarity.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic for determining the winner is incorrect. The program calculates the total number of digits in the list and then subtracts the sum of the trailing zeros in pairs. This approach does not correctly model the game's rules, especially the part where Anna reverses the digits of an element and Sasha concatenates two elements.

3. **Winning Condition**: The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is not the correct way to determine if the final number will be greater than or equal to \(10^m\). The game's rules require a more complex analysis of the possible moves and their outcomes.

4. **Output Error**: The output for the winner is incorrectly spelled as "Sashah" instead of "Sasha".

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider the following:

- **Anna's Move**: Anna can reverse any number, which might change the number of digits in the number.
- **Sasha's Move**: Sasha can concatenate any two numbers, which will always increase the number of digits in the list.
- **Winning Condition**: The game ends when there is exactly one number left in the list. Sasha wins if this number has at least \(m\) digits. Otherwise, Anna wins.

A correct solution would involve:

1. **Counting Digits**: Count the total number of digits in the list after Anna's optimal moves.
2. **Optimal Play**: Determine the optimal play for both players, considering the number of digits and the structure of the numbers.
3. **Final Check**: Check if the final number can have at least \(m\) digits after Sasha's moves.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def count_digits(num):
    return len(str(num))

def reverse_number(num):
    return int(str(num)[::-1])

n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test

for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Anna's optimal move: reverse the number with the most digits
    max_digits = max(count_digits(num) for num in array)
    if max_digits >= m:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        # Sasha's optimal move: concatenate the two largest numbers
        array = sorted(array, key=lambda x: (count_digits(x), x), reverse=True)
        while len(array) > 1:
            num1 = array.pop(0)
            num2 = array.pop(0)
            array.append(int(str(num1) + str(num2)))
        
        final_number = array[0]
        if count_digits(final_number) >= m:
            answers[test] = 'Sasha'
        else:
            answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Count Digits**: The `count_digits` function returns the number of digits in a number.
2. **Reverse Number**: The `reverse_number` function reverses the digits of a number.
3. **Initial Check**: If the largest number in the list already has at least \(m\) digits, Sasha wins immediately.
4. **Optimal Play**: If not, simulate Sasha's optimal moves by concatenating the two largest numbers until only one number remains.
5. **Final Check**: Determine the winner based on the number of digits in the final number.

This approach ensures that the program correctly models the game and determines the winner based on the rules provided.
