The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `num`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, the loop will execute if the range defined by `range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1)` is not empty. This range starts from `len(num) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches -1 (exclusive). For the loop to execute, `len(num) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `len(num)` must be at least 1.

Before the loop starts, `counter` is 0, but this does not affect the loop's execution. The state of `i` needs to be adjusted to start at `len(num) - 1`, which is the first value the loop will use.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `num` has at least one element, and `i` starts at `len(num) - 1`.

State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, `counter` is 0**
