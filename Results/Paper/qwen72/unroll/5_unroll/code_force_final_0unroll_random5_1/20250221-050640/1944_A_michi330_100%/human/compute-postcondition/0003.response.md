The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the number of islands, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, with the constraint 0 ≤ k ≤ n(n-1)/2. The function is expected to be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n-1)/2). It returns a value based on the given `n` and `k`, but the specific return value or type is not provided in the constraints.**
