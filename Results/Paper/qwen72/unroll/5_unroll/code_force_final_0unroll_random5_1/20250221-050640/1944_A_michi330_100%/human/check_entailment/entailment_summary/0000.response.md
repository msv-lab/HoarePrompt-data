Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most \( k \) bridges. The key insight here is to understand the connectivity of the islands and how the destruction of bridges affects it.

1. **Initial Connectivity**: Initially, every island is connected to every other island, forming a complete graph. In a complete graph with \( n \) nodes, there are \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) edges (bridges).

2. **Bridge Destruction Strategy**: Dominater's goal is to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit. The most effective way to do this is to isolate island 1 as much as possible by destroying the bridges that directly connect to it.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - If \( k \geq n - 1 \): Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, which isolates it completely. Everule will only be able to visit island 1, so the answer is 1.
   - If \( k < n - 1 \): Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely. Even if \( k \) bridges are destroyed, there will still be at least one bridge connecting island 1 to another island, allowing Everule to visit all \( n \) islands. Therefore, the answer is \( n \).

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
- It checks if \( k \geq n - 1 \). If true, it prints 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.
- If false, it prints \( n \), indicating that Everule can visit all \( n \) islands.

The program handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
