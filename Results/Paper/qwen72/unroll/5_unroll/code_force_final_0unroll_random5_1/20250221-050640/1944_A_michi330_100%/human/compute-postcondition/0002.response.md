Output State: **The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations. For each iteration, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the output is `1`. Otherwise, the output is `n`. The variable `t` is now 0, as the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `n` and `k` are not retained after each iteration, as they are re-assigned in each iteration based on the input.**
