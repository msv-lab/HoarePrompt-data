Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n - 1` but still significant enough to isolate more than one island. For example, consider the test case where `n = 5` and `k = 3`. According to the problem description, Dominater can destroy 3 bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit. The optimal strategy would be to isolate one island by destroying 3 bridges, which would leave Everule able to visit only 2 islands (including island 1). However, the program will output `5` in this case, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
