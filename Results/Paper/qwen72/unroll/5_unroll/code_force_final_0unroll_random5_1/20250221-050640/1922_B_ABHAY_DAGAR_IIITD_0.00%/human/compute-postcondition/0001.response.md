The loop head contains the variable `_` and the object `test_cases`. The loop will execute based on the length of `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must have at least one element. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `results` is not relevant to the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 element, `_` is 0 (indicating the start of the loop)**
