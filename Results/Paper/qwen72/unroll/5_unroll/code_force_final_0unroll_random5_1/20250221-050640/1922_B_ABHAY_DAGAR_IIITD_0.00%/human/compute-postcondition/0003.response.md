The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `results` is a list containing the number of ways to pick three sticks from each test case such that the lengths of the sticks form a triangle, and the length of `results` is equal to the length of `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `results` must have at least one element, and `result` will be the first element in the `results` list.

State: **`results` is a list containing the number of ways to pick three sticks from each test case such that the lengths of the sticks form a triangle, and `results` must have at least one element, `result` is the first element in `results`**
