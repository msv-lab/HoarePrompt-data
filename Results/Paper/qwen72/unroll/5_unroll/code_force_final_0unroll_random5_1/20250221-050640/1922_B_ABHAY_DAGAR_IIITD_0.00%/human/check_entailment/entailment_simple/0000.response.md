### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1(t)`.
   - Inside `func_1`, it iterates over each test case, reading the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent in `num_list`.

3. **Triangle Formation Logic:**
   - The program calculates the number of ways to form a triangle using the sticks.
   - It first checks if there are at least three sticks of the same length. If so, it calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks from these using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \).
   - It then checks if there are at least two sticks of the same length. If so, it calculates the number of ways to choose two sticks from these and one stick from the previously counted sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times total\_count = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \times total\_count \).

4. **Total Count Update:**
   - The `total_count` variable is updated with the count of each unique exponent as it is processed.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Triangle Formation Conditions:
- For a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
- Given the lengths of the sticks are \(2^{a_i}\), the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if all three sticks have the same length. This is because \(2^a + 2^b > 2^c\) is only true if \(a = b = c\).

### Verification of the Program:
- The program correctly counts the number of ways to choose three sticks of the same length.
- It also correctly counts the number of ways to choose two sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length, but this part is not necessary for forming a non-degenerate triangle with the given constraints.
- The program does not handle the case where the sticks have different lengths, but this is not a problem because such a combination cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem description and constraints. It correctly calculates the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle using the sticks.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
