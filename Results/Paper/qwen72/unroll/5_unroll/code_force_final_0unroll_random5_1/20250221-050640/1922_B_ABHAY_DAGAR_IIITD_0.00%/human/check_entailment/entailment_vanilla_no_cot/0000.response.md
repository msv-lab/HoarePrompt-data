Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**: It counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary (`num_of_lens`), which is an efficient way to handle the input.

3. **Triangle Formation Logic**:
   - **Three Sticks of the Same Length**: If there are at least three sticks of the same length, the program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks of that length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \).
   - **Two Sticks of the Same Length and One Different**: If there are at least two sticks of the same length, the program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose two sticks of that length and one stick of a different length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times total\_count = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \times total\_count \), where `total_count` is the cumulative count of all previously processed stick lengths.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

The logic and implementation are sound and should work correctly for the given constraints and problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
