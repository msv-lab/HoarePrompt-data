The code snippet assigns the return value of `func_1` to the variable `test_cases`. Since `func_1` is expected to return a non-negative integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` will hold this non-negative integer value. The function `func_6` is not called in this snippet, so its impact is not relevant to the current state.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-negative integer representing the number of test cases.**
