Output State: **`n` and `m` retain their initial values, `graph` is updated to reflect the connected components after the loop execution, `edges` remains sorted in descending order by weight, `dsu` has the nodes unionized based on the edges, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight that was part of a union operation, `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes that were last unionized with the minimum edge weight, `colors` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, `res` is the result of the `dfs` function call starting from `node_u` with the initial parent `-1` and an empty list as the initial path.**
