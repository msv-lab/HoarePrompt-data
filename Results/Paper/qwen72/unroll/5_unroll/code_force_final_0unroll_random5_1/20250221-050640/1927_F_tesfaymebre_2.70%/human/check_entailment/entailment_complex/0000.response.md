Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are responsible for reading and parsing input. They are correctly implemented and handle the input as described in the problem.

2. **Graph Construction and Edge Sorting:**
   - In `func_6`, the graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, and edges are stored in a list of tuples. The edges are then sorted in descending order by weight, which is appropriate for the problem since we want to find the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization:**
   - The DSU class is correctly initialized with `n + 1` nodes (to account for 1-based indexing). The `find` and `union` methods are implemented correctly to manage the disjoint sets and track the minimum edge weight.

4. **Cycle Detection and Minimum Edge Weight Tracking:**
   - The function `func_6` iterates through the sorted edges and uses the DSU to unionize nodes. If a cycle is detected (i.e., the nodes are already in the same set), it updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle.
   - However, there is a logical issue in the cycle detection part. The condition `if parent_u == parent_v:` should be `if parent_u != parent_v:` to unionize the nodes. The current condition is incorrect and would prevent the union operation from happening when it should.

5. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Cycle:**
   - The `dfs` function is designed to find a cycle starting from `node_u`. It correctly marks vertices with colors to track the state of the traversal and appends the current vertex to the path.
   - The function returns the path if it finds a cycle that includes `node_v`. If no such cycle is found, it returns an empty list.

6. **Output:**
   - The function `func_6` prints the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices in the cycle. This matches the required output format.

7. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The function `func_7` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_6` for each test case.

Given the logical issue in the cycle detection part of `func_6`, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
