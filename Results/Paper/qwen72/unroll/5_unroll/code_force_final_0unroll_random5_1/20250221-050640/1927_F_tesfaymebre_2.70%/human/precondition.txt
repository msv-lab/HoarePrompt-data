t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers for each test case such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n·(n - 1)/2, 2·10^5), and for each edge, u, v, and w are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. The graph is undirected and does not contain loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. The sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
