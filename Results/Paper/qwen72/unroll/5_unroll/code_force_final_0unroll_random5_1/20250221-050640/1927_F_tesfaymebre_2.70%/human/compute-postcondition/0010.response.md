Functionality: ** The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search in a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex), `parent` (the parent vertex of `curr`), and `path` (the current path in the DFS traversal). The function returns a list of non-negative integers representing the path in the DFS traversal if a specific node (`node_v`) is found in the path. If `node_v` is not found or if the traversal completes without meeting the conditions, the function returns an empty list. The function also updates the color of the vertices to track the state of the traversal. **
