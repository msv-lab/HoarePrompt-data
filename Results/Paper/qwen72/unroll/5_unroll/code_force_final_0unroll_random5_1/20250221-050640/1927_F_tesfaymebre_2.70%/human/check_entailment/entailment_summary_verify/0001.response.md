### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly uses `func_1` to read the number of test cases and `func_3` to read the number of vertices and edges for each test case. It also uses `func_3` to read the edges and their weights.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - The graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each vertex is mapped to a list of its neighbors. This is a common and efficient way to represent a graph in Python. The edges are stored in a list of tuples, which is also correct.

3. **Edge Sorting:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. This is done to ensure that the heaviest edges are considered first, which is a key part of the algorithm to find the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - The DSU class is correctly implemented with `find` and `union` methods. The `find` method uses path compression, and the `union` method correctly updates the parent and the minimum edge weight of the components.

5. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles. However, there is a logical error in the cycle detection part. The line `dsu.union(u, v, w)` should not be called if `parent_u == parent_v` because it would incorrectly union the sets and potentially overwrite the minimum edge weight. The original assessment correctly identifies this issue.

6. **DFS for Cycle Path:**
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the actual path of the cycle. The function uses a `colors` array to keep track of the state of each node (0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited). If a node is revisited while it is being visited, a cycle is detected, and the path is returned. However, the original implementation does not handle the cycle path construction correctly. The original assessment correctly identifies this issue.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle. It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order. The original implementation may print an incorrect path due to the issues in cycle detection and path construction.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program addresses the issues identified in the original assessment:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import sys
import threading

# Function to read an integer
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

# Function to read a list of integers
def func_3():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())

# Function to read a list of integers
def func_4():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))

# Disjoint Set Union (DSU) class
class DSU:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.min_edge = [float('inf')] * n

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y, w):
        px = self.find(x)
        py = self.find(y)
        if px != py:
            self.parent[px] = py
            self.min_edge[py] = min(self.min_edge[px], self.min_edge[py], w)

# Function to find the cycle
def func_6():
    (n, m) = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        (u, v, w) = func_3()
        graph[u].append((v, w))
        graph[v].append((u, w))
        edges.append((w, u, v))
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            if w < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = w
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)

    def dfs(curr, parent, path):
        if colors[curr] == 1:
            return path
        colors[curr] = 1
        path.append(curr)
        for nei, weight in graph[curr]:
            if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
                res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
                if res:
                    return res
        colors[curr] = 2
        return []

    cycle_path = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    cycle_start = cycle_path.index(node_v)
    cycle_path = cycle_path[cycle_start:]
    print(_min_edge, len(cycle_path))
    print(*cycle_path)

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()

# Run the main function
func_7()
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identified the issues in the cycle detection and path construction parts of the program. The corrected program addresses these issues and should correctly find and print the simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect, and the issues identified in the original assessment are valid.)
