The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin), which is expected to contain integers separated by spaces. It then converts each string in the input into an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not take any arguments and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the caller has a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.
