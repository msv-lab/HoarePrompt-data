def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    #The program returns an integer value read from the standard input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts the resulting string to an integer, and returns this integer value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are used in the function signature. The function reads a line from standard input and returns it as a string.
def func_2():

    #The program returns a string that represents a line read from standard input, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line from standard input and returns it as a string with any leading or trailing whitespace removed. The function does not modify any external variables or state.

    #The program returns a map object containing the integers read from the input, where each integer was originally provided as a string separated by spaces in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin), which is expected to contain integers separated by spaces. It then converts each string in the input into an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not take any arguments and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the caller has a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.

def func_4():

    #The program returns a list of integers read from the standard input, where each integer is separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input from the standard input, splits the line into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is used to read input from stdin, which is assumed to be formatted according to the problem description.
def func_5():
    return list(sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    #The program returns a list of strings, where each string is a word or number from the line read from stdin, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads a single line from standard input (stdin), strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings. Each string in the list represents a word or number from the input line. The function returns this list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are directly passed to the function `func_6()`. However, the function relies on the existence of a `func_3()` function that returns pairs of integers (n, m) and triples of integers (u, v, w) representing the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the edges with their weights, respectively. The graph is represented using a `defaultdict` of lists, and `edges` is a list of tuples (w, u, v) where w is the weight of the edge between vertices u and v. The `DSU` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere and provides methods `find`, `union`, and `min_edge` for managing disjoint sets and tracking the minimum edge weight in each set.
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()

        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` and `m` retain their initial values, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key (node) has a list of connected nodes (edges), and `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges in the format (weight, node1, node2).
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: `n` and `m` retain their initial values, `graph` is updated to reflect the connected components after the loop execution, `edges` remains sorted in descending order by weight, `dsu` has the nodes unionized based on the edges, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight that was part of a union operation, `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes that were last unionized with the minimum edge weight.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum edge weight that was part of a union operation and len(res) is the number of nodes in the connected component that includes node_u)
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: [nodes or edges in the path or cycle starting from node_u and including node_v] (where node_u and node_v are the last nodes unionized with the minimum edge weight)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` constructs a graph and processes it using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure. It initializes the graph and a list of edges based on the output of `func_3`. After sorting the edges in descending order by weight, it uses the DSU to unionize nodes and track the minimum edge weight that was part of a union operation. The function then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the node that was last unionized with the minimum edge weight and prints the minimum edge weight and the number of nodes in the connected component. It also prints the nodes in the path or cycle starting from the specified node. The function does not return any values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a non-negative integer representing the current vertex in the graph, parent is a non-negative integer representing the parent vertex of curr in the DFS traversal, and path is a list of non-negative integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal.
def dfs(curr, parent, path):
    if (colors[curr] == 1) :
        return path
        #The program returns the list 'path' which is a list of non-negative integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal.
    #State: curr is a non-negative integer representing the current vertex in the graph, parent is a non-negative integer representing the parent vertex of curr in the DFS traversal, and path is a list of non-negative integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal. Additionally, the color of the current vertex (curr) is not 1.
    colors[curr] = 1
    path.append(curr)
    for nei in graph[curr]:
        if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
            res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
            set_res = set(res)
            if res and node_v in set_res:
                return res
        
    #State: The loop iterates through all neighbors (nei) of the current vertex (curr) in the graph. For each neighbor, if the neighbor's color is not 2 and the neighbor is not the parent, the function `dfs` is called with the neighbor as the new current vertex, the current vertex as the new parent, and the current path appended with the neighbor. If the result of the `dfs` call (res) is not empty and contains the node `node_v`, the loop returns this result (res). If the loop completes all iterations without returning, the state remains unchanged: curr is still the current vertex, parent is still the parent vertex, path is still the current path with `curr` appended to it, and the color of the current vertex (curr) is still 1.
    colors[curr] = 2
    return []
    #The program returns an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search in a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex), `parent` (the parent vertex of `curr`), and `path` (the current path in the DFS traversal). The function returns a list of non-negative integers representing the path in the DFS traversal if a specific node (`node_v`) is found in the path. If `node_v` is not found or if the traversal completes without meeting the conditions, the function returns an empty list. The function also updates the color of the vertices to track the state of the traversal.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_7`. The function `func_1` is expected to return a non-negative integer `test_cases` representing the number of test cases, and `func_6` is expected to handle the processing of each test case.
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: `test_cases` is a non-negative integer representing the number of test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls `func_1` to get a non-negative integer `test_cases` representing the number of test cases. Then, it iterates `test_cases` times, calling `func_6` in each iteration. After the function concludes, `test_cases` remains a non-negative integer representing the number of test cases processed.
