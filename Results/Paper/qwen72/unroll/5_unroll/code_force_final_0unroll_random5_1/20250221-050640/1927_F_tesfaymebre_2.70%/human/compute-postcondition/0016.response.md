The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters directly. It relies on an external function `func_3` which returns pairs of integers (n, m) representing the number of vertices and edges, and a list of triples (u, v, w) representing the edges with their weights. The function uses these values to construct a graph represented by a `defaultdict` of lists and a list of tuples (w, u, v) where w is the weight of the edge between vertices u and v. The function also utilizes a `DSU` class, which is assumed to be defined elsewhere, to manage disjoint sets and track the minimum edge weight in each set.

Functionality: **The function `func_6` constructs a graph from the output of `func_3` and uses a `DSU` class to manage disjoint sets and track the minimum edge weight. It returns the result of processing this graph using the disjoint set union (DSU) methods.**
