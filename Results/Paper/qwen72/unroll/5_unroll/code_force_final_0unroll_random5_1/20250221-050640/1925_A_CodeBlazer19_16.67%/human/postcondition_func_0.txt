The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (both between 1 and 26, inclusive) from the user. The function constructs a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet. If `k` is 1, it prints the string `s` repeated `n` times. If `k` is greater than 1, it prints the string `s` twice unless `n` is 1, in which case it prints `s` once. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is unchanged except for the output printed to the console.
