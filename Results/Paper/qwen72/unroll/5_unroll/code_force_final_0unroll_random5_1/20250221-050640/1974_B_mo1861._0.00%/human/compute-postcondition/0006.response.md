To determine the output state, let's break down the given loop and initial conditions:

### Initial State:
- `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from the string `b` is mapped to a lowercase Latin letter, starting from 'z' and moving backwards.
- The characters in `b` are sorted in ascending order.
- `s` is an empty string.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for c in b:
    s += char_map[c]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Mapping Characters**: The `char_map` dictionary maps each unique character in `b` to a lowercase Latin letter, starting from 'z' and moving backwards. For example, if `b` contains the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c', and they are sorted as 'a', 'b', 'c', then `char_map` would be:
   - `char_map['a'] = 'z'`
   - `char_map['b'] = 'y'`
   - `char_map['c'] = 'x'`

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `b` and appends the corresponding mapped character from `char_map` to the string `s`.

### Example:
Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `b = 'abc'`.
- The sorted unique characters in `b` are 'a', 'b', 'c'.
- The `char_map` would be:
  - `char_map['a'] = 'z'`
  - `char_map['b'] = 'y'`
  - `char_map['c'] = 'x'`

- The loop would execute as follows:
  - First iteration: `c = 'a'`, `s += char_map['a']` -> `s = 'z'`
  - Second iteration: `c = 'b'`, `s += char_map['b']` -> `s = 'zy'`
  - Third iteration: `c = 'c'`, `s += char_map['c']` -> `s = 'zyx'`

### Output State:
After the loop has finished executing, the string `s` will contain the mapped characters from `char_map` in the order they appear in `b`.

Output State: **`s` is a string containing the mapped characters from `char_map` in the order they appear in `b`.**
