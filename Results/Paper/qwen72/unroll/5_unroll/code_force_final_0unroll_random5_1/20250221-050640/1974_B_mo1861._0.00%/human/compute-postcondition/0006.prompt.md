Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from the string `b` is mapped to a lowercase Latin letter, starting from the last character of the alphabet ('z') and moving backwards. The characters in `b` are sorted in ascending order, and the first character in this sorted order is mapped to the last available letter in the alphabet, the second to the second last, and so on, until all unique characters are mapped. The length of `b` remains unchanged, and `b` itself is not modified. `s` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for c in b:
    s += char_map[c]


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
