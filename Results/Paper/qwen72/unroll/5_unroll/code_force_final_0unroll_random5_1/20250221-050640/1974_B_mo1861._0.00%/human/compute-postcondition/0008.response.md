The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `b`. `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns a new string `s` that contains the characters from `b` mapped according to a predefined `char_map`, in the order they appear in `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `b` and returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is mapped to a corresponding character from `char_map`, maintaining the original order of characters in `b`.**
