The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used within the loop. The other parameters (n, a, b, and c) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
