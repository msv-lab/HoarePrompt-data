### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - The function constructs a template `template` by iterating through each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, it appends `a[i]` (which is the same as `b[i]`) to the template.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, it appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the template. This ensures that the template will have an uppercase character where `a` and `b` differ, which means `a` and `b` will match the template by definition.

3. **Matching Check for `a` and `b`:**
   - The function checks if `a` and `b` match the template.
   - For each character in the template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, it ensures that both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - If any of these conditions fail, `match_a_b` is set to `False`.

4. **Matching Check for `c`:**
   - The function checks if `c` does not match the template.
   - For each character in the template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, it ensures that `c[i]` is different from the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that `c[i]` is the same as the lowercase version of the template character.
   - If any of these conditions fail, `match_c` is set to `False`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints 'YES' if `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues:
- **Template Construction:**
  - The template construction logic is correct. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, they should be lowercase in the template. If they differ, they should be uppercase to ensure both `a` and `b` match the template.

- **Matching Check for `a` and `b`:**
  - The logic for checking if `a` and `b` match the template is correct. It ensures that the conditions for lowercase and uppercase characters are met.

- **Matching Check for `c`:**
  - The logic for checking if `c` does not match the template is incorrect. Specifically, the condition for uppercase characters in the template is reversed:
    - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` should be different from the lowercase version of the template character, not the same.
    - The correct condition should be:
      ```python
      elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
          match_c = False
          break
      ```

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        template = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        
        match_a_b = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        match_c = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the `match_c` check.
- After correcting the `match_c` check, the program should work correctly for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False** (due to the logical error in the `match_c` check).
