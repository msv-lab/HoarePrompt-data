Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 50,000`. It then performs `t` iterations, each time reading two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000,000`. For each pair of `n` and `k`, the function calculates and prints an integer value. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` retain their initial values after the function completes, and the function does not return any value. **
