Output State: **The loop will print a series of integers, one for each iteration, based on the input values of `n` and `k`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` will retain their initial values, while the variables `s` and `m` will be reset to 0 and 1, respectively, at the start of each iteration. After the loop finishes all iterations, `t` will be unchanged, and `n` and `k` will retain their last input values.**
