Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen over `k` excursions, where the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if the pair is chosen. The program, however, does not correctly compute the expected value. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The program uses a loop to calculate `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each excursion `i`. This is incorrect because it does not properly account for the expected increase in friendship values.
   - The correct approach should involve calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each chosen pair, which is a function of the number of friends and the total number of possible pairs.

2. **Modular Inverse Usage**:
   - The program correctly calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs `n * (n - 1) // 2` to handle the probability of choosing a pair of friends. However, the way it is used in the loop is incorrect.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - The program correctly initializes `a` as the sum of initial friendship values, but it does not update `a` correctly to reflect the expected increase in friendship values over the excursions.

4. **Expected Value Formula**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each chosen pair should be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot (a + i - 1) \right)
     \]
   - Here, \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) is the total number of possible pairs, and \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\) is the probability of choosing a pair of friends.

5. **Simplification**:
   - The expected value can be simplified to:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot \left( a \cdot k + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \right)
     \]
   - This simplification avoids the need for a loop and directly computes the expected value.

6. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program should use modular arithmetic to ensure that all intermediate results and the final result are within the range of \(10^9 + 7\).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
