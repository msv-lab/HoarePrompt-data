Reasoning:  
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func()` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect. It should take parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of tuples representing the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Loop Variable Reuse**: The variable `i` is reused in both the outer loop (iterating over test cases) and the inner loops (iterating over friendship pairs and excursions). This can lead to unexpected behavior and is generally a bad practice.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `s`**: The calculation of `s` inside the loop is incorrect. The program attempts to update `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each excursion. This does not correctly reflect the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the current friendship values of all pairs, plus the expected increase in friendship value for the chosen pair. The expected increase for a chosen pair is `1` if the pair is friends, and `0` otherwise.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The program uses modular arithmetic correctly by taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but the calculation itself is flawed.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen should be calculated as follows:
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the friendship value of a chosen pair is `1` if the pair is friends, and `0` otherwise.
   - The probability of choosing a friend pair is `m / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
   - The expected value for each excursion is the sum of the current friendship values of all pairs plus the expected increase in friendship value for the chosen pair.
   - The total expected value is the sum of these expected values over all k excursions.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
