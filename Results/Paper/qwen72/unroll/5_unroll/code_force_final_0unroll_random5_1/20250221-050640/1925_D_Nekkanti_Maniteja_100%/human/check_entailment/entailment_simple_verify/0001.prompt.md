You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func()` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of tuples representing the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values. The parameters should satisfy: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the list of tuples should contain m elements, each with three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.

    #State: The function `func()` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of tuples representing the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values. The parameters should satisfy: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the list of tuples should contain m elements, each with three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The variables `s` and `a` will be updated after the loop execution. `s` will be the result of the loop computation modulo \(10^9 + 7\), and `a` will be the sum of all friendship values `f` from the input tuples.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes the constant `M` to \(10^9 + 7\), which is the modulus required for the output.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the probability `c` of selecting a pair of friends from all possible pairs of children. This is done using the formula:
     \[
     c = \left( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \right)^{-1} \mod M
     \]
   - This is correct because the total number of pairs of children is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), and the probability of selecting a specific pair is the reciprocal of this value modulo \(M\).

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The program reads the friendship values of the `m` pairs and sums them up in the variable `a`.
   - This is correct as it correctly accumulates the initial friendship values.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.
   - The formula used in the loop is:
     \[
     s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the expected value calculation:
     - \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m \) accounts for the increase in friendship value for each pair of friends chosen in the previous `i` excursions.
     - \( c \cdot a \) accounts for the initial friendship values of the pairs.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program ensures that the result is taken modulo \(M\) at the end.
   - This is correct as it ensures the result fits within the required constraints and is in the correct form.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `m` is 0 (no friends) correctly, as the expected value will be 0.
   - It also handles the case where `m` is 1 (one pair of friends) correctly, as the friendship value increases linearly.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses efficient operations such as modular inverse and modular addition, which are necessary for handling large inputs within the constraints.

However, there is a potential issue in the expected value calculation:
- The term \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m \) should be simplified to \( c^2 \cdot i \cdot m \) to avoid unnecessary multiplications and ensure correctness.

Given this, the program is almost correct but has a minor inefficiency in the expected value calculation. The correct formula should be:
\[
s = s + c^2 \cdot i \cdot m + c \cdot a
\]

Correctness: **False**

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        c2 = c * c % M
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c2 * i * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

This corrected version ensures that the expected value calculation is done efficiently and correctly.
