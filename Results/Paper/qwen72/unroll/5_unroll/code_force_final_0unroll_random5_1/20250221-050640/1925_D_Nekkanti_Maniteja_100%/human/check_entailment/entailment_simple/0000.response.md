### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**:
   - The function `func()` is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem description.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, which are the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively.

2. **Modulo Calculation**:
   - The constant `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is used for all modulo operations to ensure the results fit within the required constraints.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This is correct because the probability of choosing any specific pair of children is \(\frac{1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\).

4. **Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - The variable `a` is used to store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends. This is correctly computed by iterating over the `m` pairs and summing their friendship values.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The variable `s` is used to accumulate the expected sum of friendship values over all `k` excursions.
   - The loop iterates `k` times, and for each iteration, it updates `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship value for that excursion.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is calculated as `c * i * c * m + c * a`. This is incorrect because:
     - `c * i * c * m` is not the correct way to calculate the expected increase in friendship value.
     - The correct expected increase in friendship value for each excursion should be `c * (a + i)`, where `a` is the sum of initial friendship values and `i` is the current excursion number (since the friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion).

6. **Output**:
   - The final result `s % M` is printed for each test case, which is the expected value of the sum of friendship values modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
The program is **incorrect** because the expected value calculation in the loop is flawed. The correct expected increase in friendship value for each excursion should be `c * (a + i)`, not `c * i * c * m + c * a`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        a = 0
        
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        s = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (a + i)) % M
        
        print(s)
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
