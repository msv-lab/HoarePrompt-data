The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of tuples `friendships`. `n` is an integer representing the number of people, such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. `m` is an integer representing the number of friendships, such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2). `k` is an integer representing a threshold value, such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5. The `friendships` list contains `m` elements, each a tuple of three integers (a_i, b_i, f_i), where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9, representing the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the problem description. Given the context, the function likely processes the friendships and their values to determine some outcome related to the threshold `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of tuples `friendships`. It processes the friendships and their values to determine an outcome based on the threshold `k`.**
