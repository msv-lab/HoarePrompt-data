Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Friendship Value:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen. However, the way it updates the sum `s` is incorrect. The line `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is not the correct way to calculate the expected value.
   - The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the current friendship values of all pairs, plus the expected increase in friendship value if a pair of friends is chosen. This expected increase is the sum of the current friendship values of all pairs of friends, divided by the total number of possible pairs.

2. **Incorrect Modulo Operations:**
   - The program uses `c * i * c * m + c * a` which involves multiple multiplications and additions. This can lead to overflow issues and incorrect results when dealing with large numbers. The correct approach should involve modular arithmetic to ensure that all operations are within the bounds of the modulo.

3. **Incorrect Update of Friendship Values:**
   - The program does not correctly update the friendship values for subsequent excursions. The friendship value of a pair of friends should increase by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen, but the program does not handle this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
- Calculate the initial sum of friendship values of all pairs of friends.
- Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion.
- Use modular arithmetic to ensure all operations are within the bounds of the modulo.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        if total_pairs == 0:
            print(0)
            continue
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        expected_sum = (a * k + m * k * (k + 1) // 2) % M
        print(expected_sum)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Sum of Friendship Values (`a`):** This is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
- **Expected Value Calculation:** The expected value for each excursion is the sum of the current friendship values of all pairs of friends (`a`), plus the expected increase in friendship value if a pair of friends is chosen. The expected increase is the sum of the current friendship values of all pairs of friends, divided by the total number of possible pairs, and this value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion.
- **Modular Arithmetic:** All operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the results are within the required bounds.

This corrected program should produce the correct output for the given problem.
