Output State: **The function `func()` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of tuples representing the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values. The parameters should satisfy: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the list of tuples should contain m elements, each with three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The variables `s` and `a` will be updated after the loop execution. `s` will be the result of the loop computation modulo \(10^9 + 7\), and `a` will be the sum of all friendship values `f` from the input tuples.**

Explanation:
- The variable `s` is updated in the inner loop, where it accumulates the result of the computation `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each iteration from 0 to `k-1`.
- The variable `a` is updated in the first inner loop, where it accumulates the sum of all friendship values `f` from the input tuples.
- The final value of `s` is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `c`) remain unchanged after the loop execution.
