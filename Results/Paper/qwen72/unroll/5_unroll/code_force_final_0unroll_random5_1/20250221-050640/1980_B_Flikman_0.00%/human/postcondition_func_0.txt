The function `func` reads an integer `t` and then, for each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, followed by a list `a` of `n` integers. It determines if there are at least `k` integers in `a` that are greater than the integer at index `f-1` in `a`. If there are, it prints 'YES'. If there are fewer than `k` integers greater than the favorite value and the total count of integers equal to or greater than the favorite value is less than or equal to `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value.
