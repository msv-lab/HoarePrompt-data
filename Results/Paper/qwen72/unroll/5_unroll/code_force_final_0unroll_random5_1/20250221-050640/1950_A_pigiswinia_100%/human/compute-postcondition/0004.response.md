Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9) from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After executing `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be those read in the last test case, while the value of `t` remains unchanged. **
