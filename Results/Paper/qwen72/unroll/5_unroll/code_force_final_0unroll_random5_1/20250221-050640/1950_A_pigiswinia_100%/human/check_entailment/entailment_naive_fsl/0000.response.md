Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It checks if the digits form a stair (`a < b < c`), a peak (`a < b > c`), or neither, and prints the appropriate output for each test case. The logic is straightforward and covers all edge cases, including when the digits are equal or do not satisfy either condition. No potential cases where the program would fail have been identified.
