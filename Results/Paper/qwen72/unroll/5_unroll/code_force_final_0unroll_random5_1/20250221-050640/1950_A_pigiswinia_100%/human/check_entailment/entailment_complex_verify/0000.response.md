Reasoning: 

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. This matches the problem description and ensures that the program processes the correct number of test cases.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if true. This correctly identifies a stair as per the problem description.
   - **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if true. This correctly identifies a peak as per the problem description.
   - **Neither Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'NONE'. This covers all other cases, including when the digits are equal or do not form a stair or a peak.

3. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, as specified in the problem description. The output is in the correct format and matches the expected results for the given examples.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should result in 'NONE'.
   - The program handles cases where the digits do not form a stair or a peak (e.g., `4 1 7`), which should also result in 'NONE'.
   - The program correctly identifies stairs and peaks in the given examples.

5. **State Management**:
   - The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated for each test case, which is necessary for processing multiple test cases.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the program, which is expected as it only serves to control the number of test cases.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement and handles all specified cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
