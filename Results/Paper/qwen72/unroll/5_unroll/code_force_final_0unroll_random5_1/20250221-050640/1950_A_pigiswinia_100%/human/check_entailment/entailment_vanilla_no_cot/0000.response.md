Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks if the digits form a stair (`a < b < c`), a peak (`a < b > c`), or neither.
4. It prints the appropriate output for each test case.

The program handles the input and output as described in the problem and correctly identifies the conditions for a stair and a peak. Therefore, the program is correct.
