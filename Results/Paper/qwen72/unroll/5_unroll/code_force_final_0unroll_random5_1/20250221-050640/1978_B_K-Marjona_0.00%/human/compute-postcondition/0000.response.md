The loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop head, but it represents the number of test cases, which is implicitly related to the input that determines the loop's execution.

To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, we can assume that the input will be a valid integer within this range. However, for the loop to execute, the input must be at least 1.

State: **`_` is not relevant to the loop's execution, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
