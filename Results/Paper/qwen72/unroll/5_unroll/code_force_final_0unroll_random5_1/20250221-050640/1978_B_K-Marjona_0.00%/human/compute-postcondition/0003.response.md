Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) from the input. The function then calculates and prints a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it prints a value calculated using the formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a`, where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are input values. **
