The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list containing two sublists. The first sublist represents an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) with elements (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and the second sublist represents an array `b` of the same length `n` with elements (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). Both `a` and `b` are sorted in non-decreasing order.

The function returns a new list where the sublists are reversed in order, meaning the sublist `b` comes first, followed by the sublist `a`. Both sublists `a` and `b` remain sorted in their original non-decreasing order.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` containing two sorted sublists `a` and `b`, and returns a new list where the sublists are reversed in order, with `b` coming first and `a` coming second. Both sublists remain sorted in non-decreasing order.**
