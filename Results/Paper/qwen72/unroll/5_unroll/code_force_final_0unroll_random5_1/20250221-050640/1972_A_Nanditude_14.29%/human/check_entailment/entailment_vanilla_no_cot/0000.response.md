Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Insertion and Deletion Logic**:
   - The program attempts to insert `b[j]` into the list `a` at position `i` and then pops the last element. This logic is flawed because it does not ensure that the list `a` remains sorted after each insertion and deletion. Instead, it should insert a new problem with a difficulty that helps to make `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Insertion**:
   - The condition `if b[j] < a[i]` is incorrect. The program should check if `a[i] > b[i]` and then insert a new problem with a difficulty that is just enough to make `a[i] <= b[i]`.

3. **Sorting After Each Operation**:
   - The program does not sort the list `a` after each insertion and deletion. This is necessary to maintain the non-decreasing order of the list.

4. **Unnecessary Function**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never used in the program. This function sorts the array in descending order, which is not needed for the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
- Iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.
- For each index `i`, if `a[i] > b[i]`, you need to insert a new problem with a difficulty that is just enough to make `a[i] <= b[i]`.
- After each insertion, sort the array `a` to maintain the non-decreasing order.
- Count the number of insertions required to make `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if a[i] > b[i]:
            a.pop(-1)
            a.append(b[i])
            a.sort()
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**: Read the number of test cases `t`.
- **For each test case**:
  - Read the number of problems `n`.
  - Read the arrays `a` and `b`.
  - Initialize a counter `cnt` to count the number of new problems.
  - Use a while loop to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.
  - If `a[i] > b[i]`, insert a new problem with difficulty `b[i]` into `a`, sort `a`, and increment the counter `cnt`.
  - If `a[i] <= b[i]`, move to the next index `i`.
- **Output**: Print the counter `cnt` for each test case.

This approach ensures that the array `a` remains sorted and that the number of new problems required is minimized.
