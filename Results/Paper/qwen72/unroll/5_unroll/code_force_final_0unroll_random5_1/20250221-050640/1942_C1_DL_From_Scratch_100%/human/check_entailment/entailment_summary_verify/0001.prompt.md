You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case includes the number of sides of a polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices, plus the number of chosen vertices minus 2. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the variables `T`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `list0` will hold the values from the last test case processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of chosen vertices `list0`.

2. **Sorting the Chosen Vertices**:
   - The program sorts the list of chosen vertices `list0`. This is necessary to easily determine the gaps between consecutive vertices.

3. **Counting Triangles**:
   - The program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of vertices and calculates the number of vertices between each pair of consecutive chosen vertices.
   - If the number of vertices between two consecutive chosen vertices is exactly 1, it increments the `count` by 1. This is because a gap of 1 vertex allows the formation of one additional triangle.

4. **Handling the Wrap-Around Case**:
   - The program also checks the gap between the last and the first vertex in the sorted list, considering the wrap-around nature of the polygon.
   - If this gap is exactly 1, it increments the `count` by 1.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The program prints the sum of `count` and `x - 2`. The term `x - 2` accounts for the initial triangles that can be formed by the chosen vertices themselves.

6. **Constraints and Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the fact that `y = 0` in this version of the problem.
   - It ensures that the vertices are distinct and within the range from 1 to `n`.

7. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the correct number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case.

Given the problem description and the constraints, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake. The reasoning and the steps taken in the program align with the problem requirements.
