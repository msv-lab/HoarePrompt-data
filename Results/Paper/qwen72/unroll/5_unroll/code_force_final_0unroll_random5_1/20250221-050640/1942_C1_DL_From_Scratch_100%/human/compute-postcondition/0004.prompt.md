You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a specific problem context, including the number of test cases t, the number of sides of the polygon n, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen x, the maximum number of other vertices you can choose y (where y = 0), and a list of x distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The values must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y = 0. The sum of x over all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        
        print(count + x - 2)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop will output the number of gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices, plus the number of chosen vertices minus 2. The variables `T`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `list0` will be updated for each test case, but their values will be determined by the input for each iteration. The final values of these variables will be the ones from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `vertices`. It returns a list of results, each indicating the number of ways to choose `y` additional vertices to form a convex polygon with Bessie's chosen vertices, for each of the `t` test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
