Precondition: **The function should be called with a specific problem context, including the number of test cases t, the number of sides of the polygon n, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen x, the maximum number of other vertices you can choose y (where y = 0), and a list of x distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The values must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y = 0. The sum of x over all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
