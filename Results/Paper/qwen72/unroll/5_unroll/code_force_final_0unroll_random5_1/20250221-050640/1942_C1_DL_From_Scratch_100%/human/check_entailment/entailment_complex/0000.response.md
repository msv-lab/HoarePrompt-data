Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. **Sorting the Chosen Vertices**: The function sorts the list of chosen vertices (`list0`). This is necessary to ensure that the vertices are processed in a clockwise order, which is important for correctly counting the gaps between them.

3. **Counting Gaps of Size 1**: The function iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices and counts the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices. This is done using the loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(x - 1):
       num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
       if num == 1:
           count += 1
   ```
   This correctly counts the gaps of size 1 between the vertices.

4. **Handling the Wrap-Around Gap**: The function also handles the wrap-around gap between the last and the first vertex in the sorted list:
   ```python
   num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
   if num == 1:
       count += 1
   ```
   This correctly checks if the gap between the last and the first vertex is of size 1.

5. **Calculating the Number of Triangles**: The function then prints the result for each test case, which is the number of gaps of size 1 plus `x - 2`. The formula `count + x - 2` is used because:
   - Each gap of size 1 can form a triangle with the two adjacent vertices.
   - The remaining `x - 2` vertices can form `x - 2` additional triangles by connecting them to the two endpoints of the chosen vertices.

6. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

7. **Constraints**: The function handles the constraints correctly. It ensures that `y` is always 0, and it processes the input within the given constraints for `t`, `n`, and `x`.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
