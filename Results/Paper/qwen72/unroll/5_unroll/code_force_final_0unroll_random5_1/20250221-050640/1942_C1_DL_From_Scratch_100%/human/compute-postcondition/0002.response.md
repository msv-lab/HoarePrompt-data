Output State: **For each test case, the loop will output the number of gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices, plus the number of chosen vertices minus 2. The variables `T`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `list0` will be updated for each test case, but their values will be determined by the input for each iteration. The final values of these variables will be the ones from the last test case.**
