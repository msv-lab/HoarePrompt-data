Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the list of integers `n` for each test case from the input.

2. **Precomputation**: The function precomputes a list `values` where each element at index `i` (from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`. This is done efficiently by iterating through each integer, converting it to a string to sum its digits, and then storing the cumulative sum in the `values` list.

3. **Efficiency**: The precomputation step runs in \(O(2 \cdot 10^5)\) time, which is efficient given the constraints. The subsequent loop for each test case runs in \(O(t)\) time, where \(t\) is the number of test cases, and each test case lookup in the `values` list is \(O(1)\). This ensures that the function can handle the maximum number of test cases (up to \(10^4\)) within the 0.5 seconds time limit.

4. **Correct Output**: For each test case, the function correctly prints the cumulative sum of the digits of the integers from 1 to the given `value`. This is achieved by directly accessing the precomputed `values` list, which ensures the output is correct and efficient.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1, 2, or 3, where the sum of digits is straightforward.

6. **Memory Usage**: The function uses a list of size 200001 to store the cumulative sums, which is within the typical memory limits for such problems.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
