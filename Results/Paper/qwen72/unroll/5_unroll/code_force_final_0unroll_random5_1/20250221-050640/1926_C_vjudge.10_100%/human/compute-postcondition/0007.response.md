Output State: **The value of `t` remains the same input integer between 1 and 10^4, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`. The loop prints the cumulative sum of the digits of the integers from 1 to `value` for each input `value` provided `t` times.**
