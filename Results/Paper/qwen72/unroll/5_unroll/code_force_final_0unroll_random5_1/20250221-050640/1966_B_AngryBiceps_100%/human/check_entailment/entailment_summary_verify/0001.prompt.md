You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1]):
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` and then iterates `t` times. In each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a grid of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B'. The function checks if the first and last rows of the grid, as well as the first and last characters of each row, meet certain conditions. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After all iterations, the function has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each grid, and the state of the program is the same as before the function call, except for the output produced.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The problem involves determining if it is possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the following key points:
1. **Initial Configuration**: If the entire grid is already the same color, the answer is clearly "YES".
2. **Color Transition**: If there is a way to transition all squares to a single color, it must be possible to do so by selecting appropriate subrectangles.
3. **Edge Cases**: We need to handle edge cases where the grid is small (e.g., \(1 \times 1\)) or where the grid has a specific pattern that makes it impossible to achieve a uniform color.

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1]):
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid row by row and stores it in the list `a`.

2. **Extracting First and Last Rows**:
   - The program constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
   - `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of each row.
   - `last_row` is the concatenation of the last characters of each row.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The program checks if the first row and the last row are both uniform (i.e., all characters are the same) but different from each other.
   - If this condition is met, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color if the first and last rows are uniform but different.
   - Similarly, it checks if the first column and the last column are both uniform but different from each other.
   - If this condition is met, it prints "NO" for the same reason.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Uniform Rows and Columns**:
  - If the first row and the last row are both uniform but different, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color because the operation can only change the color of subrectangles, and the first and last rows would remain different.
  - Similarly, if the first column and the last column are both uniform but different, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color for the same reason.

- **General Case**:
  - If neither of the above conditions is met, it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the operation can be used to gradually change the color of the grid, starting from any two squares of the same color and expanding the subrectangle.

### Edge Cases:
- **1x1 Grid**: The program will correctly handle this case because the grid will always be uniform.
- **Uniform Grid**: The program will correctly handle this case by printing "YES" since the grid is already the same color.
- **Non-Uniform Grid**: The program will correctly handle this case by checking the conditions and printing "YES" if the conditions are not met.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly checks the necessary conditions to determine if it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
