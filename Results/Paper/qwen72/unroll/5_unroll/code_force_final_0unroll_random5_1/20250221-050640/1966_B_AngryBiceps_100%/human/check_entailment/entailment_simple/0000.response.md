### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`, and then the grid itself. This is done in a loop that runs `t` times.

2. **Grid Construction**: The grid `a` is constructed by reading `n` lines, each containing a string of length `m`. This is done correctly using a list comprehension.

3. **First and Last Row/Column Check**:
   - The program checks if the first row and the last row of the grid are uniform (i.e., all characters in the row are the same) but different from each other. If this is the case, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color if the first and last rows are uniform but different.
   - Similarly, the program checks if the first column and the last column of the grid are uniform but different from each other. If this is the case, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Output**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'YES'. This is based on the observation that if there are no uniform rows or columns that are different from each other, it is always possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **First Row and Last Row Check**: If the first row and the last row are uniform but different, it means that the entire grid cannot be made uniform because there is no way to change the color of one row to match the other without affecting the other rows.
- **First Column and Last Column Check**: Similarly, if the first column and the last column are uniform but different, it means that the entire grid cannot be made uniform because there is no way to change the color of one column to match the other without affecting the other columns.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Row/Column Grid**: If the grid has only one row or one column, the program will always print 'YES' because a single row or column is already uniform.
- **Uniform Grid**: If the entire grid is already uniform (all 'W' or all 'B'), the program will print 'YES' because no operations are needed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the conditions under which it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color and prints 'NO' in those cases. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The logic is sound and covers all the necessary edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
