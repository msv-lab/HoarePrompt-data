Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` and then iterates `t` times. In each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a grid of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B'. The function checks if the first and last rows of the grid, as well as the first and last characters of each row, meet certain conditions. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After all iterations, the function has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each grid, and the state of the program is the same as before the function call, except for the output produced. **
