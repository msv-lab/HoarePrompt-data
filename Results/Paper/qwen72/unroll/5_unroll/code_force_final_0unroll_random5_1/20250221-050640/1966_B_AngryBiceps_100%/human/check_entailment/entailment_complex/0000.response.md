Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color using the specified operations. The function reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid, and the grid itself. It then checks certain conditions to determine if it is possible to make all squares the same color.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Initial and Final States:**
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The state of the program before and after the function call is as described in the comments.

2. **Conditions Checked:**
   - The function checks if the first and last rows of the grid are entirely the same color but different from each other. If this condition is met, it prints 'NO'.
   - The function also checks if the first and last characters of each row are the same but different from each other. If this condition is met, it prints 'NO'.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'YES'.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **First and Last Rows:**
  - If the first row and the last row are entirely the same color but different from each other, it is impossible to make all squares the same color because no operation can change the color of the entire first row to match the last row or vice versa.
- **First and Last Characters of Each Row:**
  - If the first and last characters of each row are the same but different from each other, it is also impossible to make all squares the same color because no operation can change the color of the first column to match the last column or vice versa.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Row or Single Column:**
  - If the grid has only one row or one column, the function should print 'YES' because it is trivial to make all squares the same color.
  - The function handles this correctly because the conditions checked will not be met in such cases.

- **All Squares Already the Same Color:**
  - If all squares are already the same color, the function should print 'YES'.
  - The function handles this correctly because the conditions checked will not be met in such cases.

### Potential Issues:
- **Incorrect Condition Logic:**
  - The function checks if the first and last rows are entirely the same color but different from each other, and if the first and last characters of each row are the same but different from each other. However, it does not consider other possible configurations that might prevent the grid from being uniform.
  - For example, if the grid has a pattern like:
    ```
    BWB
    WBW
    BWB
    ```
    The function will print 'YES' because the conditions are not met, but it is impossible to make all squares the same color in this case.

### Conclusion:
The function is incorrect because it does not fully capture all the conditions that would prevent the grid from being made uniform. Specifically, it fails to consider patterns where the first and last rows or columns are not entirely the same color but still prevent uniformity.

Correctness: **False**
