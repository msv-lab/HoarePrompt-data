Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n` and `m` from input, constructs a grid `a` of `n` strings each of length `m`, and checks certain conditions on the grid. After all iterations, `t` is unchanged, and `n`, `m`, and `a` are not retained between iterations. The variables `first_row` and `last_row` are reset for each iteration. The output state is the same as the initial state, except that the loop has been executed `t` times, and the program has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each grid based on the conditions checked.**
