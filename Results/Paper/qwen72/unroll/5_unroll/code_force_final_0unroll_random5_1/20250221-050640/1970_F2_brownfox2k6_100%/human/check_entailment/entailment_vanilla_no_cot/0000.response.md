Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the required functionality to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incomplete Functionality**: The program only includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which are not sufficient to handle the entire game logic. For example, there are no functions to handle scoring, catching the Quaffle, or moving the Quaffle to the center of the field after a goal is scored.

2. **Missing Data Structures**: The program does not define the necessary data structures to keep track of the positions of players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger. It also does not define the goals or the score for each team.

3. **No Main Game Loop**: The program lacks a main loop that processes the T steps and applies the actions to the entities on the field.

4. **No Output for Goals**: The program does not include any logic to print the scoring events or the final score.

5. **No Handling of the Quaffle**: There is no function or logic to handle the Quaffle being caught, thrown, or moved to the center of the field after a goal.

6. **No Validation of Actions**: The program does not validate actions such as catching the Quaffle or throwing it, which are crucial for the correctness of the game.

To be correct, the program should include all the necessary components to simulate the game, handle all the actions, and produce the required output. Here is a more complete outline of what the program should include:

- **Data Structures**: 
  - `player` dictionary to store player positions.
  - `quaffle` list to store the Quaffle position.
  - `bludger` list to store the Bludger position.
  - `goals` dictionary to store the positions of the goals.
  - `score` dictionary to store the scores of each team.

- **Main Game Loop**: 
  - Iterate through the T steps and apply the actions to the entities.
  - Check for scoring, catching, throwing, and elimination events.
  - Print the events as they occur.

- **Event Handling Functions**:
  - Function to move entities.
  - Function to catch the Quaffle.
  - Function to throw the Quaffle.
  - Function to check for scoring.
  - Function to check for elimination.

- **Final Score Output**: 
  - Print the final score after all steps are processed.

Given these missing components, the provided program is incorrect and incomplete.
