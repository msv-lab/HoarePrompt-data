You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of `q` pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `a` remains the same list of integers as in the initial state. `t` remains the same integer representing the number of test cases. `n` and `q` remain the same integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries. `c` remains the same list of integers. `queries` remains the same list of `q` pairs of integers. `b` is now a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `1` or `2` based on the condition `a[i] > 1` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. Specifically, if `a[i] > 1`, then `b[i] = b[i - 1] + 1`, otherwise `b[i] = b[i - 1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The values of `a`, `t`, `n`, `c`, `queries`, and `b` remain unchanged. The loop prints 'NO' or 'YES' for each query based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries`. It processes `t` test cases, each with an array `c` of length `n` and `q` queries. For each query (l_i, r_i), the function returns the result of an operation on the subarray of `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive). The function returns a list of results for all queries.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
