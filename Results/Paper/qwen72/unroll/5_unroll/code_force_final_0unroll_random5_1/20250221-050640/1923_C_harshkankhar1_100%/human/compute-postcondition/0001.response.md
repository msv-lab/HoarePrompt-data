The code snippet `a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then prepends a 0 to the resulting list to form the list `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first element is 0, and the subsequent elements are the integers from the input. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of `q` pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
