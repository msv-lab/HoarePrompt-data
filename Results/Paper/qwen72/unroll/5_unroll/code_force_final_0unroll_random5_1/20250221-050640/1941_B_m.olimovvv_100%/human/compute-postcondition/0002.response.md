The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_j <= 10^9 for each j from 1 to n, representing the input list of integers.

The function returns different outputs based on the input values:
- Case_1: If `t` is outside the range 1 to 10^4, the function returns an error message.
- Case_2: If `n` is outside the range 3 to 2 * 10^5, the function returns an error message.
- Case_3: If any element `a_j` in the list `a` is outside the range 0 to 10^9, the function returns an error message.
- Case_4: If all input constraints are satisfied, the function processes the list `a` and returns a result based on the processing logic for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. It returns an error message if any of the input constraints are violated. If all constraints are satisfied, it processes the list `a` and returns a result for each test case.**
