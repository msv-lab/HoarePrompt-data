Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array elements are not in a specific configuration that allows the operation to reduce all elements to zero. Specifically, the logic in the program assumes that the elements can be reduced to zero in a linear manner, which is not always true. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program will output:
```
NO
```

However, it is possible to make all elements zero using the operations. Here's one way:
- Apply the operation at \( i = 2 \): \([0, 0, 2, 4, 5]\)
- Apply the operation at \( i = 3 \): \([0, 0, 0, 2, 4]\)
- Apply the operation at \( i = 4 \): \([0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\)
- Apply the operation at \( i = 4 \) again: \([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\)

Thus, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this case, making it incorrect.
