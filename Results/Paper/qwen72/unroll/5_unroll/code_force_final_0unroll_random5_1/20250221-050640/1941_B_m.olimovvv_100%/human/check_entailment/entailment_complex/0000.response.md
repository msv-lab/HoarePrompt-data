### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `a` (the length of the array) and the list `b` (the array itself).

2. **Operation Logic**:
   - The function iterates over the array `b` from index 0 to `a-3` (inclusive) and performs the following operations:
     - If `b[i]` is negative, it immediately prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
     - It then adjusts the elements at indices `i+1` and `i+2` based on the value of `b[i]`:
       - `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2`
       - `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`
       - `b[i] -= b[i]` (which effectively sets `b[i]` to 0).

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if the last two elements of the array `b` are zero.
   - If both `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are zero, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues:
- **Variable Naming**: The variable `a` is used to store the length of the array, but the problem description uses `n` for this purpose. This is a minor issue and does not affect the correctness of the logic.
- **Negative Check**: The function correctly checks if any element in the array becomes negative during the operations, which is a valid condition to print 'NO'.
- **Final Check**: The final check to ensure the last two elements are zero is necessary to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly implements the logic to check if the array can be reduced to all zeros using the specified operations.
- The logic is sound and handles the constraints and requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The function correctly determines whether the array can be reduced to all zeros using the specified operations and handles the input and output as required by the problem description.
