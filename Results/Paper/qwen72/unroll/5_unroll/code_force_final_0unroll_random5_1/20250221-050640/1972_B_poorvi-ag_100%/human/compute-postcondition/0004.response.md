The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must be a non-empty list. The state of `results` is already defined as a list of strings where each string is either 'yes' or 'no', and its length is equal to `t`. To ensure the loop executes, `results` must have at least one element.

State: **`results` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `results`**
