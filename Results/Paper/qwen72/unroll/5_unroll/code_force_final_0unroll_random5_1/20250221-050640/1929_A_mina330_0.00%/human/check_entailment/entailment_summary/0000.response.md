Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second to the last element. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. Sorting the array and then pairing the smallest and largest elements (and their next smallest and next largest, and so on) ensures that the differences are maximized. However, the program only sums the differences for the first half of the sorted array, which is incorrect. The correct approach should sum the differences for all consecutive pairs in the sorted array.

The current program calculates the sum of differences for the first half of the sorted array, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array. For example, for the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the program will only consider the differences `(5 - 1)` and `(4 - 2)`, missing the difference `(3 - 3)`. This approach will not always yield the correct maximum beauty.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
