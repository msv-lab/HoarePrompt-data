### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the 2nd to the nth element.
   - The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ntest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The program then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list, repeated for the first half of the list.

3. **Algorithm Validation**:
   - Sorting the array and then calculating the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the first half of the list is a valid approach to maximize the beauty.
   - This is because the largest possible difference between any two elements in the array is achieved by pairing the smallest and largest elements, and the next smallest and next largest elements, and so on.
   - The sum of these differences will indeed give the maximum possible beauty.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`), resulting in a beauty of 0.
   - The program also handles the case where the array has an odd number of elements, as it only iterates up to `len(a) // 2`, which ensures that the middle element is not considered twice.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case, which matches the expected output in the provided example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
