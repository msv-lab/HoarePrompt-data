Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `ntest` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list, repeated for the first half of the list. This sum, `kq`, is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `ntest` is the number of test cases processed, `n` is the last read number of elements, `a` is the last sorted list of integers, and `kq` is the last calculated sum of differences for the current test case. **
