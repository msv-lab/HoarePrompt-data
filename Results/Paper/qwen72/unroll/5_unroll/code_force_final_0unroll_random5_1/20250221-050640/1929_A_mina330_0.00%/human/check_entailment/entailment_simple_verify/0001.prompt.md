You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())

        n = int(input())

        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        
        print(kq)
        
    #State: ntest is an input integer, t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and kq is the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list a, repeated for the first half of the list, for each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can change the beauty value.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the elements of the array \(a\).
   - It sorts the array \(a\).
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, up to the middle of the array.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - **Sorting the Array:**
     - Sorting the array ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.
   - **Calculating the Beauty:**
     - The program calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.
     - This approach is correct because the maximum beauty is achieved by maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative differences. By pairing the largest and smallest elements, the program ensures that the differences are maximized.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., the second test case with all elements being 69). In this case, the beauty is 0, which is correct.
   - The program also handles the case where the array length is even or odd correctly. For odd lengths, the middle element is not considered in the differences, which is appropriate.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and then summing the appropriate differences. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
