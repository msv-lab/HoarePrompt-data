The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it appears that the function should accept four parameters: `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which likely represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18.

Given the constraints, the function is expected to return a result based on these parameters. However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the problem statement. Assuming the function processes these parameters and returns a result for each test case, we can infer the following functionality:

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers. The function processes these parameters and returns a result for each test case.**
