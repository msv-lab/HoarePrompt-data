The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the user, where `n` is the number of sticks and `a` contains the lengths of the sticks. It then calculates the total number of groups of 3 sticks that can be formed from the counts of each unique stick length in the list `a`. The function prints this total number and does not return any value. The values of `n`, `a`, and the dictionary `cnt` are not modified and remain unchanged after the function execution.
