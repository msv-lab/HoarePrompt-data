To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the initial state and the context in which `ans` is defined.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is the total number of groups of 3 sticks that can be formed from the counts of each unique stick length in the list `a`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The dictionary `cnt` remains the same as in the initial state.

### Explanation:
- `a` is a list of stick lengths.
- `cnt` is a dictionary that maps each unique stick length to its count in the list `a`.
- `ans` is calculated based on the counts of each unique stick length in `a`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Count the Sticks**: The dictionary `cnt` contains the count of each unique stick length in the list `a`.
2. **Form Groups of 3**: For each unique stick length, if the count is at least 3, we can form groups of 3 sticks using that length. The number of such groups is given by the integer division of the count by 3.
3. **Sum the Groups**: The total number of groups of 3 sticks is the sum of all such groups formed from each unique stick length.

### Example:
Let's assume `a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`.

- `cnt` would be `{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 3}`.
- For each unique stick length (1, 2, 3), the count is 3.
- The number of groups of 3 sticks that can be formed from each length is `3 // 3 = 1`.
- The total number of groups of 3 sticks is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

### General Case:
- If `a` contains multiple unique stick lengths, `cnt` will map each length to its count.
- For each length, the number of groups of 3 sticks is `count // 3`.
- `ans` is the sum of all such groups.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the total number of groups of 3 sticks that can be formed from the counts of each unique stick length in the list `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of groups of 3 sticks that can be formed from the counts of each unique stick length in the list `a`)**
