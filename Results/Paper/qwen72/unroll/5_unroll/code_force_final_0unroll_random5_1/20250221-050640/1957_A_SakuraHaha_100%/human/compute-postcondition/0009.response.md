The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n`, and an integer `t`. The list `a` represents the lengths of the sticks, with each stick length `a_i` being an integer where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. The integer `n` represents the number of sticks, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the lengths of the sticks provided in the list `a` for each test case. The specific output for each test case is not provided, but it is implied that the function will return a value or values based on the stick lengths and the number of sticks.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` representing stick lengths, an integer `n` representing the number of sticks, and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the stick lengths and the number of sticks.**
