Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of `n` characters, where the first character is always '.'. The function counts the number of times the character '@' appears in the string `s` before encountering two consecutive '*' characters. If two consecutive '*' characters are found, the counting stops. The function prints the count for each test case. The variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged after processing each test case. **
