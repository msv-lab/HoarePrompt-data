The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases and has a constraint of 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of `n` characters, which can be '.', '@', or '*'. The first character of each string is '.', indicating the starting cell is empty.

The function returns the result of processing each test case. The specific return value for each test case is not provided, but it is implied that the function processes the path represented by the string in some way and returns a corresponding result for each test case.
