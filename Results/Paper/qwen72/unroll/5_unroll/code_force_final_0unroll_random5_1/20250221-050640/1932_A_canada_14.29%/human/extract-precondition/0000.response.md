Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters ('.', '@', '*') representing the path. The first character of each string is '.', indicating the starting cell is empty.**

However, since the provided function definition does not match the problem description, I will adjust it to match the expected input parameters:

Function definition:
```
def max_coins(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters ('.', '@', '*') representing the path. The first character of each string is '.', indicating the starting cell is empty.**
