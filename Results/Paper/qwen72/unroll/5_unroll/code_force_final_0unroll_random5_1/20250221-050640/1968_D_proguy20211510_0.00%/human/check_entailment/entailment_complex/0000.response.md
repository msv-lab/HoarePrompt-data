### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` as integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` as lists of integers.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The function first checks if both players start at positions where the value in `a` is the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints 'Draw' and moves to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya starts at a position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints 'Bodya'.
   - If only Sasha starts at a position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints 'Sasha'.
   - These checks are correct because if a player starts at the maximum value, they can always stay at that position and accumulate the highest possible score.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The function simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It maintains two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively, for each turn.
   - It also maintains two boolean flags `foundb` and `founds` to track if Bodya or Sasha has found a position with the maximum value in `a`.
   - If a player finds a position with the maximum value, they stay at that position for the remaining turns, and their score is incremented by the maximum value for each remaining turn.

4. **Prefix Sums:**
   - The function calculates prefix sums for the scores of Bodya and Sasha using the lists `preb` and `pres`.
   - These prefix sums are used to determine the total score for each player after `k` turns.

5. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the final scores for Bodya and Sasha by considering the remaining turns and the maximum value in `a`.
   - It then compares the final scores and prints the winner or 'Draw' if the scores are equal.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Use of `MOD` and `alpha`:**
  - The variables `MOD` and `alpha` are defined but never used in the function. This is unnecessary and can be removed.
- **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Turns:**
  - The calculation of `rem` in the loop should be `k - i` instead of `k - (i + 1)`. This is because the loop index `i` starts from 0, so `k - (i + 1)` would incorrectly calculate the remaining turns.
- **Incorrect Final Score Calculation:**
  - The final score calculation should consider the prefix sums up to the current turn and the remaining turns, but the current implementation incorrectly adds the score of the current turn repeatedly for the remaining turns.

### Correctness:
- The initial checks and the basic structure of the game simulation are correct.
- However, the calculation of the remaining turns and the final scores is incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has logical errors in the calculation of the remaining turns and the final scores, which can lead to incorrect results. These issues need to be addressed to ensure the program works correctly for all test cases.
