### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` as integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` as lists of integers.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if both players start at the position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya starts at the position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only Sasha starts at the position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints "Sasha" and continues.
   - These initial checks are correct and handle the cases where the starting positions have the maximum value in `a`.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It maintains two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also maintains two boolean flags `founds` and `foundb` to track if either player has found the maximum value in `a`.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each turn, the program updates the scores based on the current positions of Bodya and Sasha.
   - If a player has found the maximum value in `a`, their score is updated to the maximum value for the remaining turns.
   - If a player has not found the maximum value, their score is updated based on the current position and the next position in the permutation.
   - The logic for updating the scores for the remaining turns is incorrect. The program assumes that once a player finds the maximum value in `a`, they will stay at that position for the remaining turns. However, the game rules allow a player to either stay or move to the next position in the permutation, and the optimal strategy is not necessarily to stay at the maximum value.

5. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the scores for Bodya and Sasha in `preb` and `pres`.
   - This step is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correct solution.

6. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the final scores for Bodya and Sasha by adding the remaining turns' scores to the prefix sums.
   - It then compares the maximum final scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner.
   - The final score calculation is also incorrect because it does not account for the optimal strategy of moving to other positions in the permutation.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Use of `MOD` and `alpha`:**
  - The variables `MOD` and `alpha` are defined but not used in the program. This is unnecessary and can be removed.

- **Incorrect Logic for Remaining Turns:**
  - The program assumes that once a player finds the maximum value in `a`, they will stay at that position for the remaining turns. This is not necessarily the optimal strategy and does not follow the game rules.

- **Incorrect Score Calculation:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the scores for the remaining turns by multiplying the maximum value in `a` by the remaining number of turns. This does not account for the possibility of moving to other positions in the permutation.

### Correctness:
- **False:**
  - The program does not correctly simulate the game according to the rules. It makes incorrect assumptions about the optimal strategy and the score calculation for the remaining turns.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
