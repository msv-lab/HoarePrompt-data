### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Initial Check for Maximum Value:**
   - The function checks if both `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are equal to the maximum value in `a`. If they are, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only `a[pb - 1]` is the maximum value, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only `a[ps - 1]` is the maximum value, it prints "Sasha" and continues.
   - These checks are correct because if a player starts at the maximum value and the other player does not, the player starting at the maximum value will always have a higher score if they stay at that position.

3. **Simulation of the Game:**
   - The function initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores of Bodya and Sasha for each turn.
   - It also initializes two boolean variables `founds` and `foundb` to track if Sasha or Bodya has found the maximum value in `a`.
   - For each turn up to `k`, it updates the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the rules of the game.
   - If a player finds the maximum value, they stay at that position for the remaining turns, and their score is updated accordingly.

4. **Precomputation of Scores:**
   - The function precomputes the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha using the lists `preb` and `pres`.
   - It then computes the potential final scores for each turn by adding the remaining turns' scores if the player stays at the maximum value.

5. **Determination of the Winner:**
   - The function finds the maximum potential final scores for Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares these maximum scores and prints the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Incorrect Use of `maxa` in Score Calculation:**
  - The function incorrectly assumes that once a player finds the maximum value, they will stay at that position for the remaining turns and their score will increase by `maxa` for each remaining turn.
  - This is not correct because the game rules state that a player can either stay at their current position or move to `p_x`. The function should simulate the game for the full `k` turns to determine the final scores accurately.

### Corrected Approach:
- The function should simulate the game for the full `k` turns, keeping track of the scores and positions of both players.
- It should not assume that a player will stay at the maximum value once found; instead, it should follow the rules of the game for each turn.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not accurately simulate the game for the full `k` turns and makes incorrect assumptions about the players' movements and score calculations.

**Correctness: False**
