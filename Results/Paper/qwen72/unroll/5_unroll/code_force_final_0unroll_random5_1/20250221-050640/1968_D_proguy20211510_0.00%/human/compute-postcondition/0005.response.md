Functionality: **The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but reads input from standard input. It processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers n, k, P_B, P_S, a permutation p of length n, and an array a of length n. For each test case, it returns a result based on the given inputs, ensuring that the number of test cases t is between 1 and 10^4, and the values of n, k, P_B, P_S, p_i, and a_i meet the specified constraints.**
