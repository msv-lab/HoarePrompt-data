Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search after performing at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - The binary search algorithm is applied to the permutation, and the goal is to ensure that `p_l` equals `x` after the search.

2. **Binary Search on Permutation**:
   - Binary search works efficiently on sorted arrays. However, the permutation is not sorted, so we need to perform swaps to make the binary search work correctly.
   - The key is to ensure that the binary search can find `x` by making the necessary swaps.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The provided program does contain the logic for reading input and performing the binary search, but it lacks the logic for rearranging the permutation.
   - The program reads the number of test cases, the permutation, and the number `x` for each test case.
   - It then attempts to perform a binary search and determine the number of swaps needed to ensure `x` is found correctly.

4. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2` reads `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3` reads the permutation `p` for each test case.
   - These functions are correctly used to read the input as specified in the problem description.

5. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is implemented correctly in the loop:
     ```python
     while left + 1 < right:
         mid = left + (right - left) // 2
         seen[p[mid] - 1] = 1
         if p[mid] <= x:
             left = mid
         else:
             right = mid
     ```
   - This loop correctly narrows down the search range to find the position `l` such that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

6. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program checks if `p[left]` is equal to `x` after the binary search.
   - If `p[left]` is not equal to `x`, it determines the number of swaps needed:
     - If `x` is not seen during the binary search, it prints one swap to move `x` to the correct position.
     - If `x` is seen but not at the correct position, it prints two swaps to rearrange the permutation correctly.
   - The logic for determining the swaps is not entirely correct. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the permutation is rearranged in a way that the binary search will always find `x` correctly.

7. **Correctness of Swapping**:
   - The program should ensure that after the swaps, the binary search will find `x` at the correct position.
   - The current logic for swapping is flawed because it does not consider the overall structure of the permutation and how the swaps affect the binary search.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and performs the binary search.
   - However, the logic for determining and performing the swaps is incorrect and does not guarantee that the binary search will find `x` correctly.
   - Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
