Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. It only defines a series of functions that read input in different ways, but it does not implement the logic required to rearrange the permutation so that the binary search can find the number \( x \) correctly. The program is missing the core logic for finding the number \( x \) and performing the necessary swaps to ensure the binary search works as intended. Additionally, it does not handle multiple test cases or output the required number of operations and their details.
