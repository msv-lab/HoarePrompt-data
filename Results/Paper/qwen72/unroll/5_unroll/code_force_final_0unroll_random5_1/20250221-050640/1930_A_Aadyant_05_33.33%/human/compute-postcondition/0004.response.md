The only objects in the loop head are the variable `outputs` and the list `out`. For the loop to execute, `out` must contain at least one element. Since `list1` and `list2` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`out` is a list containing the sum of the selected elements from each test case and must have at least one element, `outputs` is the first element in `out`**
