The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of 2n integers, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The integers in each test case are positive and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. The function should also handle up to t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.

Output:
- Case_1: For each test case, if the list contains an even number of integers and all integers are within the specified range, the function returns a list of results for each test case.
- Case_2: If any test case does not meet the constraints (e.g., the list does not contain an even number of integers or contains integers outside the specified range), the function returns an error message for that specific test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing a list of 2n positive integers within the range 1 to 10^7, and handles up to 5000 test cases. For each valid test case, it returns a list of results. If any test case is invalid, it returns an error message for that test case.**
