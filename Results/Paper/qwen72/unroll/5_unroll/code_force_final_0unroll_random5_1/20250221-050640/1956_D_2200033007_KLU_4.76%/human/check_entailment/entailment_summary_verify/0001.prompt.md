You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if c == 2:
        print(f'4 1')
        print(f'1 2')
    else:
        print(f'13 0')
    return



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `c` of integers, where the list has a length between 1 and 18, and each integer is between 0 and 10,000,000. It prints either "4 1" followed by "1 2" if the length of `c` is 2, or "13 0" if the length of `c` is not 2. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of the array. It then reads a line of space-separated integers, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each string to an integer before appending it to the list `a`. This part of the code is correct and follows the input format specified in the problem.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is a valid function call.

3. **Function Definition and Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `c` as an argument.
   - It initializes a variable `m` to 0, which is not used in the function.
   - If `c` (the length of the array) is 2, it prints the output `4 1` followed by `1 2`. This is the correct output for the specific case where the array has exactly two elements, as shown in the first example.
   - If `c` is not 2, it prints `13 0`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the sum of the elements of the array will always be 13 and no operations are needed, which is not true for all possible inputs. The correct approach should consider the actual elements of the array and compute the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

4. **Output**:
   - The program only handles the case where the array length is 2 correctly.
   - For all other lengths, it incorrectly outputs `13 0`, which is not a valid solution for the problem.

5. **General Solution**:
   - The program does not provide a general solution for arrays of length other than 2.
   - It does not compute the MEX of any subarray or perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array.

Given the above points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case and does not follow the required logic to solve the problem for arrays of any length.
