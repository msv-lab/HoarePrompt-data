### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input and converts it into a list of strings (`na`) and then appends these strings to the list `a`.
   - However, the elements of `a` should be integers, not strings. This can be fixed by converting `ai` to an integer during the append operation: `a.append(int(ai))`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the length of the list `a` as its argument (`c`).
   - The function only has hardcoded responses for arrays of length 2 and any other length. Specifically:
     - If the length is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
     - For any other length, it prints `13 0`.
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not compute the maximum sum or the sequence of operations for arrays of lengths other than 2. For example, for an input array of length 4, such as `[1, 100, 2, 1]`, the program will output `13 0`, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The correct output should be `105 2` with the operations `3 3` and `3 4`.

3. **General Solution**:
   - The problem requires a more general solution that can handle arrays of any length between 1 and 18.
   - The program should compute the MEX for subarrays and apply the operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.
   - The current implementation does not perform any of these steps and is thus fundamentally flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues identified, the original assessment is correct. The program does not meet the requirements of the problem for all potential inputs.

Final: **False**
