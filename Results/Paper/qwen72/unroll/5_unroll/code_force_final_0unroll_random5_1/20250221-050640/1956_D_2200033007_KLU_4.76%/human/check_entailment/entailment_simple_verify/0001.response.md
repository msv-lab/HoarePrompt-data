Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of the array.
   - It then reads a line of space-separated integers, splits it into a list of strings, and appends each string to the list `a`. However, the elements are appended as strings, not integers. This is a critical error because the program needs to work with integers, not strings.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is a valid function call, but the argument should be the array itself, not just its length.

2. **Function Definition and Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `c` as an argument, which is supposed to be the length of the array.
   - It initializes a variable `m` to 0, which is not used in the function.
   - If `c` (the length of the array) is 2, it prints the output `4 1` followed by `1 2`. This is correct for the specific case where the array has exactly two elements, as shown in the first example.
   - If `c` is not 2, it prints `13 0`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the sum of the elements of the array will always be 13 and no operations are needed, which is not true for all possible inputs. The correct approach should consider the actual elements of the array and compute the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

3. **Output**:
   - The program only handles the case where the array length is 2 correctly.
   - For all other lengths, it incorrectly outputs `13 0`, which is not a valid solution for the problem.
   - The program does not print the actual array elements or perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array.

4. **General Solution**:
   - The program does not provide a general solution for arrays of length other than 2.
   - It does not compute the MEX of any subarray or perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array.
   - The program fails to address the core requirement of the problem, which is to maximize the sum of the array by performing the specified operations.

Given the above points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case and does not follow the required logic to solve the problem for arrays of any length. Additionally, the input handling is flawed, as the elements are stored as strings instead of integers.

Final: **False**
