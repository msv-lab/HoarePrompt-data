Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input integers as strings and appends them to the list `a`. However, it should convert these strings to integers before appending them. This is a crucial error because the operations and logic in the function `func_1` expect integer values, not strings.

2. **Function Argument**: The function `func_1` is called with `len(a)` as the argument, but the function expects a list `c` as its argument. The function should be called with the list `a` itself, not its length.

3. **Logic Error**: The function `func_1` only handles the case where the length of the array `c` is 2. It prints a fixed output of `4 1` and `1 2` for this case, which is not a general solution. For arrays of other lengths, it prints a fixed output of `13 0`, which is also not a general solution. The function should handle all possible array lengths and compute the correct MEX and operations to maximize the sum.

4. **Return Statement**: The function `func_1` has a return statement that is never reached because the `print` statements are followed by the `return` without any conditions that would prevent them from being executed. This is not a functional issue but a stylistic one.

Given these errors, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
