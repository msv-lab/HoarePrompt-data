Output State: **c is a list of integers of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) where each element a_i in c satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, m is 0.** 

The variable `m` is assigned the value 0, and the list `c` remains unchanged. Each element in `c` still satisfies the condition 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, and the length of `c` is still between 1 and 18.
