Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there is a pair of friends (i, i+1) such that the best friend of the i-th friend is (i+1) and the best friend of the (i+1)-th friend is (i). If such a pair is found, it prints 2 and sets `j` to 1, breaking out of the loop. If no such pair is found, it prints 3. After all iterations, the loop finishes, and the values of `n` and `l` are reset for each new test case, while `i` and `j` are used within the loop and reset to 0 at the start of each test case.**
