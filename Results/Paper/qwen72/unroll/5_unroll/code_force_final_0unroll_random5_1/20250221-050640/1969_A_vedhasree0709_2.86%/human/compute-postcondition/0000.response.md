The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, the input should be a positive integer indicating the number of test cases.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
