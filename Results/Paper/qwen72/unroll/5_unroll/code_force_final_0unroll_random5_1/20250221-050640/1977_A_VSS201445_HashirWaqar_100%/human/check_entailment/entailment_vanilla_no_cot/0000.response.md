Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem based on the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:` checks if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - `n >= m` ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the number of cubes needed.
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even. This is because each move can either add or remove a cube, and to end up with exactly `m` cubes, the number of additions and removals must balance out in such a way that the difference is even.

3. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if the conditions are met, and "NO" otherwise, which matches the required output format.

Given these points, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem.
