The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value returned by `int(input())` must be at least 1. This value corresponds to the number of test cases `t`, which is expected to be a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state must be adjusted to reflect that `t` is at least 1 and has been provided as input.

State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `_` is 0**
