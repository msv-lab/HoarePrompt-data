Output State: **`nums` is a list of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and the remaining elements are all set to the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}}\) and the initial value of `k` minus the first element. `k` is now 0.**

Explanation: The code `nums[0] += k` adds the value of `k` (which is 0) to the first element of the list `nums`. Since `k` is 0, the first element `nums[0]` remains unchanged. The other elements of the list `nums` and the value of `k` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
