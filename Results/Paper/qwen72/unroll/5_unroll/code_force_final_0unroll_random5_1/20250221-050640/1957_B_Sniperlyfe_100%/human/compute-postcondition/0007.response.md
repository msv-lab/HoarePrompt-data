The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element of the list, `nums[0]`, is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\). The remaining elements of the list are all set to the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}}\) and the initial value of `k` minus the first element. After the list is constructed, `k` is set to 0.
