### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The sequence should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all the integers in the sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to the largest number that can be represented with the highest bit set to 1, which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.
   - It then subtracts this value from `k` and distributes the remaining value of `k` among the other elements in the list, ensuring that each element is as large as possible but does not exceed the initial value of `nums[0] + 1`.
   - Finally, any remaining value of `k` is added back to `nums[0]`.

3. **Checking the Constraints:**
   - The sum of the elements in `nums` should be `k`.
   - The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements should be maximized.

4. **Verification:**
   - **Sum Check:**
     - The initial value of `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.
     - The remaining value of `k` is distributed among the other elements, and any leftover is added back to `nums[0]`.
     - This ensures that the sum of all elements in `nums` is exactly `k`.
   - **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation:**
     - By setting `nums[0]` to the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`, we ensure that the first element has the maximum number of 1s possible.
     - Distributing the remaining value of `k` among the other elements ensures that the bitwise OR of all elements will have as many 1s as possible.
     - The distribution strategy ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s, as each element will contribute to the OR operation without overlapping bits.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Element (n = 1):**
     - If `n = 1`, the solution correctly sets `nums[0]` to `k`, which is the only possible value.
   - **Small Values of `k`:**
     - If `k` is small, the initial value of `nums[0]` will be small, and the remaining distribution will be straightforward.
   - **Large Values of `k`:**
     - If `k` is large, the initial value of `nums[0]` will be large, and the remaining distribution will ensure that the sum is maintained and the number of 1s is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. The solution handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.
