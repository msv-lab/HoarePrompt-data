Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and all other elements initialized to 0; `k` is now `k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1)`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting the value of `nums[0]`, which is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\). The list `nums` remains unchanged, with its first element still being \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and all other elements still initialized to 0. The constraints on `n` and `k` remain valid.
