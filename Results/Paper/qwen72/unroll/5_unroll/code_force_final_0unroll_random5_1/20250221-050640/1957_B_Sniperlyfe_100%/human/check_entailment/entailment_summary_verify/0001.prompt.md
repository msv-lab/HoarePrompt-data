You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k` and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element of the list `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\). The remaining elements of the list are set to the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}}\) and the remaining value of `k` after subtracting the first element, ensuring that `k` is reduced to 0 by the end of the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k`.
   - Additionally, the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all these integers should be maximized.

2. **Approach in the Program:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then sets the first element `nums[0]` to the largest number less than or equal to `k` that has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation. This is achieved by setting `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`.
   - The remaining sum `k` is then reduced by `nums[0]`.
   - The program then iterates through the remaining elements of the list, distributing the remaining sum `k` as evenly as possible among them, ensuring that each element is as large as possible without exceeding `nums[0] + 1`.
   - Finally, any remaining sum is added to `nums[0]`.

3. **Analysis of the Approach:**
   - **Sum Condition:** The sum of the elements in `nums` is correctly maintained to be `k` by the program. The initial assignment of `nums[0]` and the subsequent distribution of the remaining sum ensure that the sum condition is satisfied.
   - **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR:**
     - By setting `nums[0]` to the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`, the program ensures that the first element has the maximum possible number of 1s.
     - The subsequent elements are set to the smallest possible values that still allow the sum to be `k`, but they are limited to be at most `nums[0] + 1`. This ensures that the bitwise OR of all elements will have the maximum number of 1s, as the first element already has the maximum number of 1s, and the other elements are small enough to not introduce additional 1s in positions where `nums[0]` already has 1s.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Element (`n = 1`):** The program correctly handles this case by setting `nums[0]` to `k`.
   - **Multiple Elements (`n > 1`):** The program distributes the remaining sum `k` across the elements, ensuring that the sum condition is met and the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is maximized.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The program runs in linear time with respect to `n` for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. The approach is sound and handles all edge cases appropriately.
