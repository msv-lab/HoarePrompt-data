### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - The function `func_2` reads and splits a line of input into integers, which is used to read the values of `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program reads `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.
   - It then creates a list `arr` where each element is a tuple `[a[i], b[i]]` representing the price for Alice and Bob for the i-th item.
   - The list `arr` is sorted based on the second element (Bob's price) in ascending order.
   - A priority queue (min-heap) `k_arr` is used to keep track of the k items with the highest Bob's price that Alice can sell to Bob.
   - The function `func_3` is called to calculate the initial profit `sub_sum` by summing the Bob's prices of the items in `k_arr` and the net profit (Bob's price - Alice's price) of the remaining items in `arr` that have a non-negative net profit.
   - The program then iterates through the remaining items in `arr` and updates the profit `sub_sum` by removing the least profitable item from `k_arr` and adding the current item to `k_arr` if it results in a higher profit.
   - The maximum profit `max_value` is updated if the current `sub_sum` is greater than `max_value`.

3. **Optimality:**
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - By sorting the items based on Bob's price in ascending order, Alice ensures that Bob will take the k least valuable items for free, which minimizes Bob's contribution to Alice's profit.
   - The use of a priority queue (min-heap) ensures that Alice always considers the k most valuable items for Bob to take, while also considering the net profit of the remaining items.
   - The function `func_3` correctly calculates the initial profit by summing the Bob's prices of the k most valuable items and the net profit of the remaining items.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 0, meaning Bob cannot take any items for free.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n`, meaning Bob can take all items for free.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum profit `max_value` for each test case, which is the correct output as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating Alice's profit when both Alice and Bob act optimally. The use of sorting and a priority queue ensures that the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.

**Correctness: True**
