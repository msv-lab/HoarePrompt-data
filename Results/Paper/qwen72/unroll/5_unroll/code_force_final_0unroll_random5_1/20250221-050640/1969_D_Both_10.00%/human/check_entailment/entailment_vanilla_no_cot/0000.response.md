Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are supposed to handle input, but they use `putin()` which is not defined. The correct function to use for reading input in Python is `input()`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Profit**: The function `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic for calculating Alice's profit. The logic in the function does not account for the fact that Bob will take the `k` items with the highest `b_i - a_i` values for free, and Alice will only profit from the remaining items.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The function `func_3` does not consider the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Alice should choose items that maximize her profit, and Bob will take the `k` items with the highest `b_i - a_i` values to minimize her profit.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq
import sys

# Function to read an integer from input
def read_int():
    return int(input())

# Function to read a list of integers from input
def read_list():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

# Function to calculate Alice's profit
def calculate_profit(n, k, a, b):
    # Calculate the profit for each item if Alice buys it and Bob buys it from her
    profit = [b_i - a_i for a_i, b_i in zip(a, b)]
    
    # Sort the profit in descending order
    profit.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Alice's profit is the sum of the top (n - k) profits
    alice_profit = sum(profit[k:])
    
    return alice_profit

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    t = read_int()
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = read_list()
        a = read_list()
        b = read_list()
        print(calculate_profit(n, k, a, b))

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - `read_int` reads a single integer from the input.
   - `read_list` reads a list of integers from the input.

2. **Profit Calculation**:
   - We calculate the profit for each item as `b_i - a_i`.
   - We sort these profits in descending order.
   - Alice's profit is the sum of the top `(n - k)` profits, as Bob will take the `k` items with the highest profit for free.

3. **Main Function**:
   - The main function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and then calculating and printing Alice's profit.

This corrected version should work correctly for the given problem description.
