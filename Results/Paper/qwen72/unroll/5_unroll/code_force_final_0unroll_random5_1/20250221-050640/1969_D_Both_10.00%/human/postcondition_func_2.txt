The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`. It returns the sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 0. The input lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged after the function execution.
