The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `main_ar` and `sec_arr`. `main_ar` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i) representing the price of an item for Alice and Bob, respectively. `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains at least one integer, and the first integer in each tuple represents a value to be subtracted from the sum. The function returns the sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`. It returns the sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 0.**
