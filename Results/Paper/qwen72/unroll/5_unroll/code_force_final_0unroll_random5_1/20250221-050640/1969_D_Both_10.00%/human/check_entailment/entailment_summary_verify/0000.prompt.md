You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Example

Input

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    4 1
    
    1 2 1 4
    
    3 3 2 3
    
    4 2
    
    2 1 1 1
    
    4 2 3 2
    
    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

    1
    1
    0
    7
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Program:
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return int(putin())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())

#Function 3:
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
    return sub_summ



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`. It returns the sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 0. The input lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged after the function execution.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)` does not handle the optimal selection of items for Alice and Bob. Here are a few issues:

1. **Optimal Selection of Items**: The function `func_3` does not consider the optimal way to select items for Alice to maximize her profit while Bob minimizes it. The logic in the function simply adds values without considering the constraints and the optimal strategy.

2. **Handling of `k` Items**: The function does not handle the case where Alice buys more than `k` items and Bob takes `k` items for free. The function should consider the profit from the items Bob pays for after taking `k` items for free.

3. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not properly defined to handle the input as described in the problem statement. The function `putin()` is not defined, and the input handling is incomplete.

Here is a more detailed explanation of a potential case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4 2
2 1 1 1
4 2 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice should buy the items with prices `a = [2, 1, 1, 1]` and `b = [4, 2, 3, 2]`.
- If Alice buys all 4 items, Bob will take 2 items for free. The optimal strategy for Alice is to buy the items with the highest `b_i - a_i` values.
- The differences `b_i - a_i` are `[2, 1, 2, 1]`.
- Alice should buy the items with the highest differences: `[2, 2]` (items 1 and 3).
- Bob will take 2 items for free, so Alice's profit is `0`.

However, the provided program does not correctly handle this logic and will likely produce an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
