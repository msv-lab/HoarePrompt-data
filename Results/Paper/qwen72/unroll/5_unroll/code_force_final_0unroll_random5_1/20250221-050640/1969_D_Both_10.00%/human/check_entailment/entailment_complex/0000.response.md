Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and returns it.
   - `func_2` is used to read the input for `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes `arr`, `k_arr`, `temp_pop`, `max_value`, and `sub_sum`.
   - It reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the lists `a` and `b`.
   - The list `a` is negated to use it with a min-heap (since Python's `heapq` is a min-heap by default).
   - The program then creates a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple contains the negated price for Alice and the price for Bob.
   - The list `arr` is sorted based on Bob's prices in ascending order.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The program pushes the last `k` items from `arr` into the heap `k_arr` and removes them from `arr`.
   - It then calculates the initial `sub_sum` by calling `func_3` with the remaining items in `arr` and the items in `k_arr`.

4. **Optimal Selection:**
   - The program iterates over the remaining items in `arr` and updates `sub_sum` by:
     - Subtracting Bob's price of the current item.
     - Adding Alice's price of the current item if the sum of Alice's and Bob's prices is non-negative.
     - Pushing the current item into `k_arr` and popping the smallest item (in terms of Alice's price) from `k_arr`.
     - Adjusting `sub_sum` by subtracting the Alice's price of the popped item.
   - It updates `max_value` if the new `sub_sum` is greater than the current `max_value`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints `max_value` for each test case, which represents the maximum profit Alice can achieve.

### Issues and Analysis:
- **Negation of `a` List:**
  - The negation of the `a` list is done to use a min-heap, which is correct because Alice's prices are negated to simulate a max-heap behavior.
- **Sorting and Heap Operations:**
  - The sorting of `arr` based on Bob's prices in ascending order is correct because Bob will take the items with the highest Bob's prices for free.
  - The heap operations are used to maintain the `k` items with the highest Alice's prices (after negation) that Bob will take for free.
- **Profit Calculation:**
  - The profit calculation in `func_3` is correct. It sums the Alice's prices of the items in `k_arr` and adds the sum of Alice's and Bob's prices of the items in `arr` where the sum is non-negative.
- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob:
    - Alice tries to maximize her profit by choosing items that have a high Bob's price and a low Alice's price.
    - Bob minimizes Alice's profit by taking the items with the highest Bob's prices for free.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the problem description. It reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the maximum profit Alice can achieve while considering Bob's optimal strategy. The heap and sorting operations are used appropriately to ensure the correct items are chosen and the profit is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
