You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a` such that 2 <= n <= 50. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: The loop processes each test case by reading an integer `m` and a list of integers `arr` from the input. For each test case, it checks if the list can be made non-decreasing by performing at most one operation: replacing an element with its digits in ascending order followed by the element itself. If the list can be made non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, and the input values for `m` and `arr` remain unchanged, but the loop has printed the result for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Logic for Checking Sorted Array**:
   - The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning (i.e., from `m-1` to `1`).
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it checks if it is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`.
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, it splits `arr[i-1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the list of digits is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the list of digits is sorted, it replaces `arr[i-1]` with the first digit of the list.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, it prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True` (indicating the array can be sorted), otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correctness of the Split Operation**:
  - The program correctly splits the number into its digits and checks if the resulting list is sorted.
  - However, the program only checks the immediate previous element and its digits, which might not be sufficient to ensure the entire array can be sorted.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where the array is already sorted correctly.
  - It also handles the case where the array cannot be sorted correctly, as shown in the second test case.

- **Potential Issues**:
  - The program does not consider the possibility of multiple elements being split and their digits being inserted in the array. For example, if `arr` is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and check if `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` is sorted, which it is. However, if `arr` is `[12, 3, 45, 67, 89]`, and we split `12` and `45`, the resulting array might not be sorted.
  - The program only checks the immediate previous element, which might not be enough to ensure the entire array can be sorted. For example, if `arr` is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, and we split `12` into `[1, 2]`, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted. However, if `arr` is `[12, 3, 45, 67, 89]`, and we split `12` and `45`, the array might not be sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases where multiple elements need to be split and their digits inserted into the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
