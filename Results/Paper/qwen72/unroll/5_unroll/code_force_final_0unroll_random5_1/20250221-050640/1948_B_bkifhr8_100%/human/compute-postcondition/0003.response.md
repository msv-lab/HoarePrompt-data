Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a list of integers `a` where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a` such that 2 <= n <= 50. The function is designed to be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. The function returns a specific output based on the input list `a` and its length `n`.**
