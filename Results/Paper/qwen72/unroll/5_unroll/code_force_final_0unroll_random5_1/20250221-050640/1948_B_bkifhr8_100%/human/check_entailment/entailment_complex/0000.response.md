Reasoning:

The function `func` is intended to determine if the array `arr` can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation any number of times. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The function is only considering replacing an element with its digits and the element itself, but the problem description states that the element should be deleted and replaced with its digits in the same position. This means the function should not add the original element back to the list after splitting it into digits.

2. **Sorting Check**: The function checks if the list of digits and the current element are sorted, but this is not the correct approach. Instead, it should check if the array can be made non-decreasing after performing the operation on any element that is at least 10.

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop that checks if the array can be made non-decreasing is not correctly implemented. It should iterate through the array and check if any element that is at least 10 can be split into digits to make the array non-decreasing. If such an operation is possible, it should perform the operation and continue checking the array.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the array is already sorted or when all elements are less than 10.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
                # Check if splitting arr[i] can help
                if arr[i] >= 10:
                    digits = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i])]
                    new_arr = arr[:i] + digits + arr[i+1:]
                    if new_arr == sorted(new_arr):
                        arr = new_arr
                        ans = True
                        break
                else:
                    ans = False
                    break
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

This corrected version:
- Splits the element into digits and checks if the resulting array is non-decreasing.
- Continues checking the array after performing the operation if necessary.
- Ensures that the array is correctly modified and checked.

Given the issues in the original function, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
