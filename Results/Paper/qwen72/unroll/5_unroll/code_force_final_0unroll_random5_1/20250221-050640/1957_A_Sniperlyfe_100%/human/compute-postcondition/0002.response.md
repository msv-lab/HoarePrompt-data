Output State: **The `freq` dictionary will contain the frequency of each list (test case) in `arr`, where the keys are the lists and the values are the counts of how many times each list appears in `arr`.**

Note: The initial state mentions that `arr` is a list of lists, and the loop is incrementing the frequency of each list `n` in the dictionary `freq`. However, if `n` is treated as a list, the correct way to use it as a key in a dictionary would be to convert it to a tuple or use a different data structure that supports mutable keys. Assuming the code is intended to count the frequency of each list, the output state reflects this interpretation. If the intention was to count the frequency of the first integer in each list, the output state would be different. Please clarify if needed.
