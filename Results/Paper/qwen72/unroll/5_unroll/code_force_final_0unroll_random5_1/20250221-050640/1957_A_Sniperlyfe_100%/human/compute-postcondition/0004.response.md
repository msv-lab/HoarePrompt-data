The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. Each inner list contains integers, with the first integer being the number of sticks `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the subsequent integers being the stick lengths `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). The function returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3. This means for each unique list in `arr`, the function calculates how many times the list appears in `arr`, divides this count by 3 using integer division, and then sums up all these results.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each inner list represents a test case with the number of sticks and their lengths. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique test case by 3.**
