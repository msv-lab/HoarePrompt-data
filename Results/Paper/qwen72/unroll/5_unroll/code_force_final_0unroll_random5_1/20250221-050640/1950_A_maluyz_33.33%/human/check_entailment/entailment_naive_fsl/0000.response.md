Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify cases where the digits form a peak but are not in the order \(a < b > c\). For example, the input `3 4 1` should output "PEAK" because \(3 < 4 > 1\), but the program will incorrectly output "PEAK" for `3 4 2` as well, which does not satisfy the peak condition. The program should only output "PEAK" if \(a < b > c\) or \(a > b < c\), but it only checks for \(a < b > c\).
