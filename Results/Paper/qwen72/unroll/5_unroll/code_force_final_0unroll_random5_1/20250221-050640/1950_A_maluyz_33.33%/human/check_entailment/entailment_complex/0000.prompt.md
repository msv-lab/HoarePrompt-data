Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three digits a, b, and c where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The number of test cases, t, is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained after the loop finishes, and the variable `t` remains unchanged. The loop will have printed 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each test case based on the conditions provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts no parameters. It reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input, where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`. After processing each test case, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a <= b >= c` and `b` is the maximum, or 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained after each test case. The variable `t` remains unchanged after the function concludes.
