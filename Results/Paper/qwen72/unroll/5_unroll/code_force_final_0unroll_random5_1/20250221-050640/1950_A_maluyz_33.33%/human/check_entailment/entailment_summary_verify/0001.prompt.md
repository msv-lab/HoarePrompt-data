You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts no parameters. It reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input, where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`. After processing each test case, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a <= b >= c` and `b` is the maximum, or 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained after each test case. The variable `t` remains unchanged after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input.

2. **Conditions for Stair and Peak**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - The program checks if `a == b == c` to determine if all digits are the same. If this condition is true, it prints "NONE".
   - The program checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits (`max(a, b, c) == b`) to determine if the digits form a peak. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all digits are the same by printing "NONE".
   - The program correctly handles the case where the digits form a stair by printing "STAIR".
   - The program correctly handles the case where the digits form a peak by printing "PEAK".
   - The program correctly handles other cases (e.g., `a > b > c`, `a > b < c`, etc.) by printing "NONE".

4. **Constraints**:
   - The constraints are that `1 \leq t \leq 1000` and `0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9`. The program does not violate these constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all the specified conditions and edge cases as described in the problem.
