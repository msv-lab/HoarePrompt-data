The function `func` accepts no parameters. It is expected to handle multiple test cases internally. Each test case contains an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, where 0 indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and 1 indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The function processes these inputs to determine the optimal position `i` for laying the road.

Functionality: **The function processes internal test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` with characters 0 and 1. It returns the optimal position `i` for laying the road based on the preferences of the residents.**
