#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with no arguments, and it is expected to handle multiple test cases internally. Each test case contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string a of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where 0 indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and 1 indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The function should process these inputs to determine the optimal position i for laying the road.

    #State: The loop will print the index (0-based) of the house that divides the residents such that the number of residents who want to live on the left side and the number of residents who want to live on the right side are as balanced as possible. If multiple indices provide the same balance, the loop will print the index that is closest to the middle of the street. If the input string `s` is such that no valid division can be found, the loop will print the index that minimizes the imbalance.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple internal test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'. It determines and prints the optimal index `i` (0-based) for laying a road such that the number of residents who want to live on the left side and the number of residents who want to live on the right side are as balanced as possible. If multiple indices provide the same balance, it prints the index closest to the middle of the street. If no valid division can be found, it prints the index that minimizes the imbalance. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
