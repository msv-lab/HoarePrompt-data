You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should take four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are given in random order, but it is guaranteed that they form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

        print(res ** 2)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints the square of the side length of the square formed by the given coordinates. The variables `x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4` and `res` are updated in each iteration, but their final values after the loop depends on the last test case input. The variable `a` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases of the input. Specifically, the program assumes a specific order of the coordinates, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. The coordinates of the corners are given in random order, and the program only checks for a few specific arrangements of the coordinates. This can lead to incorrect results for some test cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1 2
4 5
4 2
1 5
```
The program will correctly output `9`. However, if the coordinates are given in a different order:
```
1
1 2
1 5
4 5
4 2
```
The program will not correctly identify the side length of the square and will produce an incorrect result. The program should be modified to correctly identify the side length regardless of the order of the input coordinates.
