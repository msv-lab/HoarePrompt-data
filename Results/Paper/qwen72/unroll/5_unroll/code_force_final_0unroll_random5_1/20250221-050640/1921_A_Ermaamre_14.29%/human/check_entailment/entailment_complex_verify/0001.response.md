### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and the coordinates of the four corners of the square for each test case.

2. **Coordinate Analysis**:
   - The program checks if the x-coordinates of the corners are equal in pairs. Specifically, it checks:
     - If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, it means the corners are aligned such that the sides of the square are parallel to the y-axis.
     - If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, it means the corners are aligned such that the sides of the square are parallel to the y-axis.
     - If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, it means the corners are aligned such that the sides of the square are parallel to the y-axis.
   - In each of these cases, it calculates the side length of the square by taking the absolute difference of the y-coordinates of the corners that share the same x-coordinate.

3. **Area Calculation**:
   - The side length `res` is squared to get the area of the square, which is then printed.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program assumes that the input coordinates are always in a specific order that allows the side length to be calculated correctly. However, the problem statement mentions that the coordinates are given in random order.
   - The program does not handle the case where the coordinates are not in the expected order, which could lead to incorrect side length calculations.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `1 2`, `4 5`, `1 5`, `4 2`
  - The coordinates are in the order: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
  - The program correctly identifies that `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, and calculates the side length as `abs(5 - 2) = 3`.
  - The area is `3 ** 2 = 9`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `-1 1`, `1 -1`, `1 1`, `-1 -1`
  - The coordinates are in the order: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
  - The program correctly identifies that `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, and calculates the side length as `abs(1 - (-1)) = 2`.
  - The area is `2 ** 2 = 4`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `45 11`, `45 39`, `17 11`, `17 39`
  - The coordinates are in the order: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
  - The program correctly identifies that `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, and calculates the side length as `abs(39 - 11) = 28`.
  - The area is `28 ** 2 = 784`, which is correct.

### Additional Test Case Analysis:

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `1 1`, `1 4`, `4 1`, `4 4`
  - The coordinates are in the order: (1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)
  - The program does not correctly identify the side length because it does not check all possible pairs of coordinates.
  - The program will fail to calculate the side length correctly in this case.

### Conclusion:
The program works correctly for the given test cases, but it relies on the coordinates being in a specific order. Since the problem statement guarantees that the coordinates are in random order, the program may fail for other valid inputs where the coordinates are not in the expected order. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is not robust enough to handle coordinates in any random order, which is a requirement of the problem statement. Therefore, it is incorrect.
