### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.

2. **Coordinate Analysis**:
   - The program checks if the x-coordinates of the corners are equal in pairs. Specifically, it checks:
     - If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, it assumes the sides of the square are parallel to the y-axis.
     - If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, it assumes the sides of the square are parallel to the y-axis.
     - If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, it assumes the sides of the square are parallel to the y-axis.
   - In each of these cases, it calculates the side length of the square by taking the absolute difference of the y-coordinates of the corners that share the same x-coordinate.

3. **Area Calculation**:
   - The side length `res` is squared to get the area of the square, which is then printed.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program assumes that the input coordinates are always in a specific order that allows the side length to be calculated correctly. However, the problem statement mentions that the coordinates are given in random order.
   - The program does not handle the case where the coordinates are not in the expected order, which could lead to incorrect side length calculations.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `1 2`, `4 5`, `1 5`, `4 2`
  - The coordinates are in the order: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
  - The program correctly identifies that `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, and calculates the side length as `abs(5 - 2) = 3`.
  - The area is `3 ** 2 = 9`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `-1 1`, `1 -1`, `1 1`, `-1 -1`
  - The coordinates are in the order: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
  - The program correctly identifies that `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, and calculates the side length as `abs(1 - (-1)) = 2`.
  - The area is `2 ** 2 = 4`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `45 11`, `45 39`, `17 11`, `17 39`
  - The coordinates are in the order: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
  - The program correctly identifies that `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, and calculates the side length as `abs(39 - 11) = 28`.
  - The area is `28 ** 2 = 784`, which is correct.

### Additional Test Case Analysis:

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `0 0`, `0 4`, `4 0`, `4 4`
  - The coordinates are in the order: (0, 0), (0, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
  - The program should correctly identify that `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, and calculate the side length as `abs(4 - 0) = 4`.
  - The area is `4 ** 2 = 16`, which is correct.
  - However, the program does not handle this case correctly because it only checks specific pairs of coordinates. If the coordinates were in a different order, such as (0, 0), (4, 0), (0, 4), (4, 4), the program would fail to identify the correct side length.

### Conclusion:
The program works correctly for the given test cases, but it is not robust enough to handle coordinates in any random order, which is a requirement of the problem statement. The program's logic is flawed because it only checks specific pairs of coordinates and does not account for all possible permutations of the input coordinates.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is not correct because it does not handle all possible input permutations and may fail to calculate the correct side length of the square for some valid inputs. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
