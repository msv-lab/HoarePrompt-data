Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical flaw in its implementation. The goal is to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. However, the program incorrectly sets the variable `l` to 'YES' for each character that meets the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]`, and then sets it to 'NO' if the loop completes without a `break` statement. This means that `l` will always be 'NO' at the end of the loop, unless the loop is broken, which is not the case here.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Initialize `l` to 'YES' at the start of each test case.
2. Iterate through each character of the strings.
3. If at any index `i`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, it's impossible to create a template that matches both `a` and `b` at that position, so print 'NO' and move to the next test case.
4. If at any index `i`, `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, it's impossible to create a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`, so print 'NO' and move to the next test case.
5. If the loop completes without finding any such index, print 'YES'.

The current program does not follow these steps correctly. Instead, it sets `l` to 'YES' for every valid character and then resets it to 'NO' at the end of the loop, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
