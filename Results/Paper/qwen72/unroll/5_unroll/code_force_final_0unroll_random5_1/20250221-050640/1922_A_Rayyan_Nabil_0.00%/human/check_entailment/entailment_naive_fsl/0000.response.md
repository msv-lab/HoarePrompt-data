Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to properly determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not. The issue lies in the logic inside the loop where it sets `l` to 'YES' if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are not equal to `c[i]` for any position `i`. However, it does not check if `a` and `b` match each other in the same positions, and it does not correctly handle the case where `a` and `b` have the same character in a position where `c` has a different character.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
abc
def
```
The program will output "YES" because `a[i]` and `b[i]` are not equal to `c[i]` for all `i`. However, the correct output should be "NO" because there is no template that can make `a` and `b` match while making `c` not match. Both `a` and `b` are identical, so any template that matches `a` will also match `b`, and since `c` is different, it will not match the template. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
