The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `l` being 'YES' does not affect the loop execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is 'YES'**
