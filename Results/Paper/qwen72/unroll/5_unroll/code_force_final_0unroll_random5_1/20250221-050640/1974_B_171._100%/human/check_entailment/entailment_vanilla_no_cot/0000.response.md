Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded strings `b`.

2. **Decoding Function**:
   - The function `func_1(encoded)` is responsible for decoding the string.
   - It first creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b`.
   - It then creates a mapping `char_map` where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its symmetric character in the list.
   - Finally, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program appends the decoded strings to a list `results` and prints each decoded string after processing all test cases.

The program follows the correct logic and handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. Therefore, it is correct.
