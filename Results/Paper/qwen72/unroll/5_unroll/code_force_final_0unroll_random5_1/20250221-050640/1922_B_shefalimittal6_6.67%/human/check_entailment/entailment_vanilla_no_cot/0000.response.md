Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The issue lies in the logic used to count the valid combinations of sticks.

1. **Triangle Inequality Theorem**: For three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick. Given that the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2, this means that for three sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\) (where \(a_i \le a_j \le a_k\)), the condition \(2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}\) must hold. This is only possible if \(a_i = a_j = a_k\), because otherwise, \(2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} \le 2^{a_k}\).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length (i.e., \(a_i = a_j = a_k\)).
   - However, it incorrectly counts combinations where two sticks have the same length and the third stick has a different length. The logic `res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` is flawed because it counts all such combinations, but not all of them will form a non-degenerate triangle.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each unique length \(2^{a_i}\) that appears at least 3 times, count the combinations of 3 sticks of that length.
   - For each unique length \(2^{a_i}\) that appears at least 2 times, count the combinations of 2 sticks of that length and one stick of a different length, but only if the different length is exactly one less than the current length (i.e., \(a_i - 1\)).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        num_of_lens = {}
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        
        res = 0
        for a, cnt in num_of_lens.items():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
            if cnt >= 2 and (a - 1) in num_of_lens:
                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * num_of_lens[a - 1]
        
        print(res)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that only valid combinations of sticks are counted, adhering to the triangle inequality theorem.
