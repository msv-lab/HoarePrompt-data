The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each `a_i` represents the exponent of the length of the i-th stick, which is 2^{a_i}. The total number of test cases, `t`, is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns the result for each test case based on the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It returns a result for each test case based on the given parameters.**
