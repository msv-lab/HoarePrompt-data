Output State: **The loop has processed all test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the number of ways to choose three sticks such that no two sticks have the same length, and the number of ways to choose two sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length. The variables `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, `res`, and `total_sum` are reset or updated for each test case, but the overall state of the program remains ready to handle the next input or terminate if all test cases have been processed.**
