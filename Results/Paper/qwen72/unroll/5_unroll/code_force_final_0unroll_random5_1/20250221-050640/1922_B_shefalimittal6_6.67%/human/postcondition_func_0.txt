The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the exponents of stick lengths. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of ways to choose three sticks such that no two sticks have the same length, and the number of ways to choose two sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the program is ready to handle new input or end.
