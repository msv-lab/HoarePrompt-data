Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to verify if a given password is strong based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by reading the length of the password and the password itself from the list.

2. **Password Verification**:
   - **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: one for digits and one for letters.
   - **Checking for Digits After Letters**: It checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. If such a case is found, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - **Sorting Check**: It checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either the digits or the letters are not sorted, it returns 'NO'.
   - **Final Return**: If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Output**: The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them line by line.

The program handles all the conditions specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
