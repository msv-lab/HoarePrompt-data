### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then processes the input in a loop, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the password string from the `data` list.
   - The index is incremented by 2 after each test case to move to the next input.

2. **Password Validation**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating the password.
   - It separates the characters into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. If such a digit is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the password consists only of letters or only of digits.
   - It correctly identifies if a digit comes after a letter.
   - It correctly checks the sorting order for both digits and letters.

4. **Output**:
   - The results of each test case are stored in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the results are printed, each on a new line.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to validate the passwords based on the given conditions. It handles all the edge cases and ensures that the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order, and no digit comes after a letter.

**Correctness: True**
