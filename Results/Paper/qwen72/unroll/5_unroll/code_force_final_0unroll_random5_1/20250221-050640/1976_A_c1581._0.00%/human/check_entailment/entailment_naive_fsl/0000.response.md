Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. It checks for the presence of digits and letters, ensures that no digit comes after a letter, and verifies that both digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. The program handles all edge cases, such as passwords with only letters, only digits, and mixed characters, and it correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
