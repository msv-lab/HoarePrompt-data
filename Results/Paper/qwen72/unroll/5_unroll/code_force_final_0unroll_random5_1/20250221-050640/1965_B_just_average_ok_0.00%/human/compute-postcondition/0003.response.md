Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. For each test case, it modifies a list `nums` that initially contains the powers of 2 from 1 to 2^23. It then prints the length of the modified list `nums` (which is 25) and the elements of the modified list. The elements of `nums` are the powers of 2 from 1 to 2^23, excluding 2^idx, and including k - 2^idx, k + 1, and k + 2^idx + 1, where `idx` is the largest integer such that 2^idx <= k. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
