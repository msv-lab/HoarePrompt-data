The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the range function. The range function depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
