Output State: **For each test case, the loop prints the length of the modified list `nums` and the elements of the modified list `nums`. The length of `nums` is 25, and the elements are the powers of 2 from 1 to 2^23, excluding 2^idx, and including k - 2^idx, k + 1, and k + 2^idx + 1. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.**
