The only variables in the loop head are `iterable` and `loop`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `loop`. If `loop` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `iterable` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints.
- Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and no two constraints are the same.
- `loop` is an input integer.

To ensure the loop executes, `loop` must be greater than 0. The variable `iterable` will start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and no two constraints are the same, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0**
