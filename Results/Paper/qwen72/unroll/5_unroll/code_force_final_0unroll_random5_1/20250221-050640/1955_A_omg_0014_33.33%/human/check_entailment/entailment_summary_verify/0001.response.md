### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. However, the problem description specifies that the input should be `n`, `a`, and `b`, not `a`, `b`, and `c`. This is a discrepancy in the variable names, which indicates a misunderstanding of the problem.

2. **Variable Assignment**:
   - The program assigns `d` as `c / 2`. This is incorrect because `c` is not defined in the problem statement. The correct variable should be `b` (the promotion price for two yogurts).

3. **Calculation**:
   - The program checks if `a * b < a * d`. This condition is incorrect because:
     - `a * b` should be the total cost of buying `a` yogurts at the promotion price, which is not what the problem requires.
     - `a * d` should be the total cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price, which is also incorrect.
   - The correct comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`n * a`) and the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and any remaining yogurts at the regular price.

4. **Output**:
   - If the condition `a * b < a * d` is true, the program prints `a * b`. This is incorrect because `a * b` is not the correct expression for the minimum cost.
   - If the condition is false, the program prints `round(a * d)`. This is also incorrect because `a * d` is not the correct expression for the minimum cost.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct logic should involve:
     - Calculating the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought: `pairs = n // 2`.
     - Calculating the cost of buying these pairs at the promotion price: `promotion_cost = pairs * b`.
     - Calculating the number of remaining yogurts: `remaining = n % 2`.
     - Calculating the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price: `remaining_cost = remaining * a`.
     - The total minimum cost is `promotion_cost + remaining_cost`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program contains multiple logical and variable assignment errors that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. The correct solution should follow the logic outlined in the "Correct Logic" section of the original assessment.

Final: **False**
