Reasoning:

The original assessment is partially correct in identifying that the program does not handle the calculation of the beauty of the array as specified in the problem description. However, the assessment's reasoning and examples are not entirely accurate.

### Analysis of the Problem Description and Program Code

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - The goal is to maximize this beauty by rearranging the elements of the array.

2. **Program Code**:
   - `func_1` sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results of each test case.

### Function Summary for `func_2`:
- `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.
- It uses `func_1` to calculate the beauty of each array.

### Function Summary for `func_1`:
- `func_1` sorts the array and calculates the beauty using `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])`.
- This is incorrect because the problem specifies that the beauty should be calculated as \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value.

### Correctness of `func_1`:
- The use of `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` in `func_1` is incorrect because it does not align with the problem's definition of beauty.
- The correct approach should be to calculate \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) directly without taking the absolute value.

### Examples from the Original Assessment:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `1 3 1 1 1`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Program Output: `0`
  - Explanation: The program outputs 0, which is correct, but for the wrong reason. The correct beauty is \((1 - 1) + (1 - 1) = 0\).

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `1 3 3 1 1`
  - Expected Output: `-2`
  - Program Output: `0`
  - Explanation: The program outputs 0, which is incorrect. The correct beauty is \((1 - 3) + (1 - 1) = -2 + 0 = -2\).

### Correct Approach:
- To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in descending order. This ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are maximized for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
- The correct implementation of `func_1` should be:
  ```python
  def func_1(array):
      array.sort(reverse=True)
      beauty = 0
      for i in range(1, len(array)):
          beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
      return beauty
  ```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified that the program is incorrect due to the use of `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])`.
- The provided examples and reasoning are partially correct but can be more precise.

Final: **False**
