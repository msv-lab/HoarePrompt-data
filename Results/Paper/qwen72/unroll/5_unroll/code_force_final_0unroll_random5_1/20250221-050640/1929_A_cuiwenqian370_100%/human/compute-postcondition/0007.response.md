To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`.

1. **`results`**: This is the list that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.
2. **`result`**: This is the variable that will hold each element of `results` during the loop execution. It does not need to be adjusted beforehand, as it will be assigned values from `results` during the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- `data` is a list of strings where the first element is `t`, followed by the input for `t` test cases.
- Each test case input consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
- The `data` list is updated to contain the split input values.
- `index` is 1 + t * (1 + n), where `n` is the number of integers in each test case.
- `results` is a list of length `t` containing the results of `func_1` applied to each test case array.

To ensure the loop executes, `results` must have at least one element. Since `t` is the number of test cases and `results` is a list of length `t`, `results` will have at least one element if `t` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `results` has at least one element, which is guaranteed if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `results` is a list of length `t` containing the results of `func_1` applied to each test case array, and `results` must have at least one element**.
