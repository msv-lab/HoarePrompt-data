Reasoning:

The original assessment is partially correct in identifying a potential issue with the use of `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` in the `func_1` function. However, the assessment's conclusion that the program is incorrect is based on a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
The problem asks for the maximum beauty of the array, where the beauty is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The key point here is that Sasha can rearrange the elements of the array in any way to maximize the beauty.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The `func_1` function sorts the array in ascending order.
   - Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are minimized, which is not the goal. The goal is to maximize the beauty.

2. **Calculation of Beauty**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - This is incorrect for the problem's requirements because the absolute differences do not necessarily maximize the beauty. The beauty should be calculated as the sum of the differences without the absolute value.

3. **Handling Duplicates**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program will output 0 for arrays with all identical elements, which is correct.
   - However, the assessment incorrectly states that the program will output 0 for the input `3 1 1`, which should be \(-2\). This is a misunderstanding because the problem asks for the maximum beauty, and sorting the array to `[1, 1, 3]` would yield a beauty of \((1 - 1) + (3 - 1) = 0 + 2 = 2\), which is the maximum possible beauty for this array.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in descending order, not ascending order. This is because the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be maximized when the largest elements are followed by the smallest elements.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort(reverse=True)
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i - 1] - array[i]
    return beauty
```

### Evaluation of the Original Program:
- The original program sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the sum of absolute differences.
- This approach does not maximize the beauty as required by the problem.
- Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array as required by the problem.

Final: **False**
