You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always find the correct `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for all possible values of `x`. Specifically, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. The program returns the first `y` it finds such that `x % y == 0` and `2 * y >= x`, but this does not necessarily maximize `gcd(x, y) + y`.

Counterexample:
For `x = 21`, the program will return `y = 18` because it is the first `y` it finds that satisfies `x % y == 0` and `2 * y >= x`. However, the correct `y` that maximizes `gcd(21, y) + y` is actually `y = 7` (since `gcd(21, 7) + 7 = 14` is greater than `gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 19`). The program does not consider all possible values of `y` to find the one that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`.
