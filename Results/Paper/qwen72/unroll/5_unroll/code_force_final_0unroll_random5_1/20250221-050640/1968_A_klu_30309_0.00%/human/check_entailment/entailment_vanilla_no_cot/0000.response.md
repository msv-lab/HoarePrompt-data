Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it attempts to find the optimal `y`. The function `func_1` iterates through values of `y` from `x-1` down to `2`, and it checks if `y` is a divisor of `x`. If `y` is a divisor and `2 * y >= x`, it immediately returns `y`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the value of `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.

To maximize `gcd(x, y) + y`, you should consider all possible values of `y` and keep track of the one that gives the maximum value of `gcd(x, y) + y`. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        y = func_1(x)
        print(y)

def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    max_sum = 1 + math.gcd(x, 1)
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        current_sum = y + math.gcd(x, y)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_val = y
    return max_val
```

In this corrected version, the function iterates through all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to `2`, calculates `gcd(x, y) + y` for each `y`, and keeps track of the maximum value and the corresponding `y`. This ensures that the returned `y` is the one that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`.
