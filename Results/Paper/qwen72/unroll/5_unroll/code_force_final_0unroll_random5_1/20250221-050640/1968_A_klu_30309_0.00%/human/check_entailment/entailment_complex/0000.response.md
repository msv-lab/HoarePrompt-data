### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return such a \( y \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - It checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) and \( 2 * y \ge x \), it returns \( y \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \) and greater than 1.
   - If no divisors are found, it returns 1.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The function correctly identifies the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \) and greater than 1.
   - The condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) ensures that \( y \) is at least half of \( x \), which is a reasonable heuristic to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - If \( x \) is a prime number, the function will return 1, which is correct because the only divisors of a prime number are 1 and the number itself.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the function correctly returns 1, as 1 is the only valid \( y \) (since \( y \) must be less than \( x \)).
   - For \( x = 10 \), the function returns 5, which is correct because \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7 \), and 5 is the largest divisor of 10 that is less than 10.
   - For \( x = 7 \), the function returns 6, which is incorrect because 6 is not a divisor of 7. The correct output should be 1.
   - For \( x = 21 \), the function returns 18, which is incorrect because 18 is not a divisor of 21. The correct output should be 7 (since \( \gcd(21, 7) + 7 = 7 + 7 = 14 \)).
   - For \( x = 100 \), the function returns 98, which is incorrect because 98 is not a divisor of 100. The correct output should be 50 (since \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100 \)).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), the function returns 750, which is incorrect because 750 is not a divisor of 1000. The correct output should be 500 (since \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 500 + 500 = 1000 \)).
   - For \( x = 6 \), the function returns 3, which is correct because \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \).

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not always return the correct \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Specifically, it fails for composite numbers where the largest divisor is not the correct answer. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
