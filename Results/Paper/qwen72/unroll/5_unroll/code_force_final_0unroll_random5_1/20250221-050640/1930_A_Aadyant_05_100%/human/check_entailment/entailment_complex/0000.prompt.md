Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case.
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: The `final` list will contain `t` integers, each representing the sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list of 2n integers for each test case. The variables `num`, `s`, `list2`, `a`, `b`, and `list1` will be in their final states after the last iteration of the loop, with `num` being equal to `int(n) - 1`, `s` being the sum of the elements at even indices of the last test case, `list2` being the sorted list of the last test case, and `list1` being the list of strings from the last input split.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: Output State: The `final` list will remain unchanged, and the variables `num`, `s`, `list2`, `a`, `b`, and `list1` will retain their final states after the last iteration of the loop. The loop will print each integer in the `final` list, one per line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) from the user, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the elements at even indices. It then prints the sum for each test case, one per line. The function does not return any value.
