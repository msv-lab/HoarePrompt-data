Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct for the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
2. **List Construction and Sorting**: For each test case, it reads the number of integers `a` (which is `2n`), then reads the integers and stores them in a list `list2`. It sorts this list, which is a key step in the algorithm.
3. **Score Calculation**: The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the smaller of each pair (i.e., the element at the even index) to the score `s`. This is the optimal way to maximize the score because the smallest elements are always chosen first, ensuring that the minimum values are added to the score.
4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, it prints the final scores for each test case.

The logic and implementation align with the problem requirements, and the program should produce the correct output for valid inputs.
