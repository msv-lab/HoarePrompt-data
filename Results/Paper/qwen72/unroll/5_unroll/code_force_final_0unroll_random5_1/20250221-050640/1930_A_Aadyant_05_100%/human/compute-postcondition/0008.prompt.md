You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case.
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: The `final` list will contain `t` integers, each representing the sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list of 2n integers for each test case. The variables `num`, `s`, `list2`, `a`, `b`, and `list1` will be in their final states after the last iteration of the loop, with `num` being equal to `int(n) - 1`, `s` being the sum of the elements at even indices of the last test case, `list2` being the sorted list of the last test case, and `list1` being the list of strings from the last input split.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: Output State: The `final` list will remain unchanged, and the variables `num`, `s`, `list2`, `a`, `b`, and `list1` will retain their final states after the last iteration of the loop. The loop will print each integer in the `final` list, one per line.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `a_list` where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). It returns a list of results, each corresponding to one of the test cases in `a_list`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
