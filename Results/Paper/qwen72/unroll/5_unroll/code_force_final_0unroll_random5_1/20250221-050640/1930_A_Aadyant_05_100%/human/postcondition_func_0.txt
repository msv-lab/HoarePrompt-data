The function reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) from the user, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the elements at even indices. It then prints the sum for each test case, one per line. The function does not return any value.
