Output State: **The `final` list will contain `t` integers, each representing the sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list of 2n integers for each test case. The variables `num`, `s`, `list2`, `a`, `b`, and `list1` will be in their final states after the last iteration of the loop, with `num` being equal to `int(n) - 1`, `s` being the sum of the elements at even indices of the last test case, `list2` being the sorted list of the last test case, and `list1` being the list of strings from the last input split.**
