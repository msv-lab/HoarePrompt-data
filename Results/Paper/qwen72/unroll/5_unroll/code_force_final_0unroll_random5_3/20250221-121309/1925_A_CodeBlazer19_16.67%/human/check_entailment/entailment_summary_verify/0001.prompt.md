You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) from the input. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 26). If `k` is 1, it prints a string consisting of `n` times the character 'a'. If `k` is greater than 1, it prints a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the English alphabet, repeated twice unless `n` is 1, in which case it is repeated once. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The goal is to find the smallest possible string `s` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then constructs a string `s` by concatenating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - If `k` is 1, it prints `s` repeated `n` times.
   - If `k` is greater than 1, it prints `s` repeated `(2 - (n == 1))` times.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Case 1: `k == 1`**
     - If `k` is 1, the only possible string of length `n` is `a` repeated `n` times.
     - The program correctly prints `s` repeated `n` times, which is `a` repeated `n` times.
     - This is correct because the only possible string of length `n` using the first 1 alphabet is `a` repeated `n` times.

   - **Case 2: `k > 1`**
     - The program prints `s` repeated `(2 - (n == 1))` times.
     - If `n == 1`, the expression `(2 - (n == 1))` evaluates to `1`, so `s` is printed once.
     - If `n > 1`, the expression `(2 - (n == 1))` evaluates to `2`, so `s` is printed twice.
     - **Subcase 2.1: `n == 1`**
       - If `n` is 1, the only possible strings of length 1 are the individual characters from `a` to `chr(96 + k)`.
       - Printing `s` once ensures that all these characters are present in `s`.
       - This is correct.
     - **Subcase 2.2: `n > 1`**
       - If `n` is greater than 1, the program prints `s` twice.
       - This ensures that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
       - However, this might not always be the smallest possible string. For example, for `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the smallest string that contains all possible subsequences of length 2 is `baab`, not `abab`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k == 1`.
   - For `k > 1`, the program does not always produce the smallest possible string that contains all subsequences of length `n`.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect for some cases.
