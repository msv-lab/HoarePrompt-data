The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the input, which is within the range 1 to 10,000. The initial state specifies that for each test case, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each integer is between 1 and 500. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500.**
