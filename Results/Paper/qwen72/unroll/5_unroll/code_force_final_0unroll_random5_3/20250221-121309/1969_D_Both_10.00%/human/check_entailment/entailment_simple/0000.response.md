### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the prices `a` and `b` for Alice and Bob, respectively, using `func_2()`.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - The program creates a list `arr` of tuples where each tuple contains the negative of Alice's price and Bob's price for each item. This is done to use a min-heap (which is what `heapq` provides) to simulate a max-heap for Alice's prices.
   - The list `arr` is sorted by Bob's prices in ascending order. This ensures that the items with the lowest Bob's prices are considered first for Bob to take for free.

3. **Initial Setup:**
   - A min-heap `k_arr` is initialized to store the items that Bob will take for free.
   - The program pushes the last `k` items from `arr` (which have the highest Bob's prices) into `k_arr` and removes them from `arr`.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The function `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)` calculates the initial profit by summing up the Alice's prices in `sec_arr` and adding the sum of Alice's and Bob's prices in `main_ar` where the sum is non-negative.
   - The program then iterates through the remaining items in `arr` and updates the profit by:
     - Removing the item with the highest Bob's price from `k_arr` and adding the current item to `k_arr`.
     - Adjusting the `sub_sum` to reflect the changes in the heap and the current item.
     - Checking if the new `sub_sum` is greater than the current `max_value` and updating `max_value` if necessary.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum profit `max_value` for each test case.

### Issues and Corrections:

1. **Incorrect Use of `heapq.heappushpop`:**
   - The `heapq.heappushpop` function returns the smallest element from the heap, not the largest. Since `k_arr` is a min-heap, the smallest element is the one with the lowest Bob's price (or highest Alice's price, since Alice's prices are negated).
   - To correctly simulate the max-heap behavior, the program should use `heapq.heappush` and `heapq.heappop` separately.

2. **Incorrect Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit calculation in `func_3` is not optimal. It should consider the profit from Bob's prices and Alice's prices separately.
   - The program should calculate the profit as the sum of Bob's prices for the items he buys minus the sum of Alice's prices for the items she buys.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Updating `sub_sum`:**
   - The logic for updating `sub_sum` is flawed. The program should correctly handle the removal and addition of items to the heap and update the profit accordingly.

### Corrected Program:

```python
import heapq
import sys

putin = sys.stdin.readline

def func_1():
    return int(putin())

def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())

def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[1]  # Sum of Bob's prices for items in sec_arr
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[1] - val_b[0] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[1] - val_b[0]  # Sum of Bob's prices minus Alice's prices for items in main_ar
    return sub_summ

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = func_1()
    for x in range(t):
        arr = []
        k_arr = []
        (n, k) = func_2()
        a = list(func_2())
        b = list(func_2())
        for i in range(n):
            arr.append((a[i], b[i]))
        arr.sort(key=lambda y: y[1] - y[0], reverse=True)  # Sort by Bob's profit minus Alice's cost in descending order
        for i in range(k):
            if arr:
                heapq.heappush(k_arr, (arr[-1][0] - arr[-1][1], arr[-1]))
                arr.pop()
        max_value = func_3(arr, k_arr)
        while arr:
            sub_sum = max_value
            sub_sum -= k_arr[0][1][1]  # Remove the smallest Bob's price from the heap
            sub_sum += arr[-1][1] - arr[-1][0]  # Add the current item's profit
            heapq.heappushpop(k_arr, (arr[-1][0] - arr[-1][1], arr[-1]))
            arr.pop()
            if sub_sum > max_value:
                max_value = sub_sum
        print(max_value)
```

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program has several logical and implementation issues that prevent it from correctly calculating Alice's profit. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work as intended.
