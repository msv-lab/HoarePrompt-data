The function `func_3` takes two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, which are lists of tuples containing two integers each. It calculates the sum of the first integers of all tuples in `sec_arr` and adds to it the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns this total sum. The input lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
