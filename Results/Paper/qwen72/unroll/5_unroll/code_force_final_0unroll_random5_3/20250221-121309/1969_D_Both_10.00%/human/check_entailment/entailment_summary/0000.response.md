### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_2` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, which is used to read the values of `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes empty lists `arr`, `k_arr`, and `temp_pop`.
   - It reads `n` and `k` using `func_2`.
   - It reads the list `a` and converts each element to its negative (to use `heapq` as a max-heap).
   - It reads the list `b` using `func_2`.
   - It creates a list `arr` of tuples where each tuple contains the corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.
   - It sorts `arr` based on the second element (Bob's price) in ascending order.
   - It pushes the last `k` elements of `arr` into `k_arr` (which is a min-heap) and removes them from `arr`.
   - It calculates the initial `sub_sum` by summing the first elements of the tuples in `k_arr` and the sums of the first and second elements of the tuples in `arr` where the sum is non-negative.
   - It updates `max_value` if `sub_sum` is greater than `max_value`.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements in `arr`, adjusting `sub_sum` by removing the last element from `arr`, pushing the last element of `arr` into `k_arr`, and popping the smallest element from `k_arr` (if any).
   - It updates `max_value` if the new `sub_sum` is greater than `max_value`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit, which is the sum of Bob's payments minus the sum of Alice's expenses.
   - Bob will take the `k` most expensive items (in terms of Bob's price) for free to minimize Alice's profit.
   - The program correctly identifies the `k` most expensive items for Bob and calculates the profit by considering the remaining items that Alice can sell to Bob.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - `func_3` calculates the sum of the first elements of the tuples in `sec_arr` and the sums of the first and second elements of the tuples in `main_ar` where the sum is non-negative.
   - This function is used to calculate the profit for a given subset of items.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 0 (Bob takes no items for free).
   - It also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` (Bob takes all items for free).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate Alice's profit based on the given problem description. It handles the input and output as specified, and the strategy for maximizing Alice's profit while minimizing Bob's impact is correctly implemented.

Correctness: **True**
