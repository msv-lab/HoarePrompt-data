To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the given code:

Initial State:
- `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers.
- `sub_summ` is 0.

Code of the loop:
```python
for val_a in sec_arr:
    sub_summ += val_a[0]
```

This loop iterates over each tuple in `sec_arr`, and for each tuple, it adds the first integer (at index 0) to `sub_summ`.

Output State:
- `main_ar` remains unchanged.
- `sec_arr` remains unchanged.
- `sub_summ` is the sum of the first integers of all tuples in `sec_arr`.

Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged, and `sub_summ` is the sum of the first integers of all tuples in `sec_arr`.**
