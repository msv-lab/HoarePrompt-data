The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`. Both `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function returns the sum of the first integers of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 0.
