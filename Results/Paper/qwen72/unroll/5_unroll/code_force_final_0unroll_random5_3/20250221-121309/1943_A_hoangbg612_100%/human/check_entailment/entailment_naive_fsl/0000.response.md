Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob correctly. Instead, it seems to be trying to determine the MEX of the array in a single pass, which does not align with the game's rules where Alice and Bob take turns to pick elements from the array.

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

In this case, the program does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns. The correct approach would involve simulating the game with both players making optimal moves, which the provided program does not do.
