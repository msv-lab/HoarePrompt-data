You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        cnt = []
        for k in M.keys():
            if M[k] == 1:
                cnt.append(k)
        if len(cnt) >= 2:
            cur = cnt[1]
        print(cur)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `S` and a list of integers `N` of length `S`. It then sorts the list `N` and processes it to determine the smallest integer `cur` that can be incremented by 1 to ensure all elements in `N` are unique and in ascending order. The function prints the final value of `cur` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `T`, `S`, `N`, `cur`, `M`, and `cnt` are reset or consumed within each iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns picking elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c` and Bob just removes the picked element from `a`.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` at the end of the game when both players play optimally.
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she will try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each number in `N`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this means the MEX has been found.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and updates the dictionary `M` to count the occurrence of `num`.
   - If the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1, indicating that all numbers up to `cur` have been included in `c`.
   - It then collects all keys in `M` that have a count of 1 (i.e., unique numbers) into a list `cnt`.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it sets `cur` to the second smallest unique number in `cnt`.

5. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The logic for updating `cur` and the dictionary `M` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if num > cur + 1` and the subsequent break statement do not correctly identify the MEX.
   - The final check `if len(cnt) >= 2` and setting `cur` to `cnt[1]` is not aligned with the optimal strategy for the game.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves understanding that Alice and Bob will play optimally to either maximize or minimize the MEX.
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest possible unique number in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to remove the smallest possible unique number to minimize the MEX.
   - The optimal strategy is to consider the number of unique elements and their positions in the sorted array.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. The logic for determining the MEX and the conditions for updating `cur` and `M` are incorrect, leading to potential incorrect results.
