Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` remains unchanged (its value is not specified and not used in the print statement).
- `ans` is explicitly stated to be 8.
- `t` and the list of lists remain unchanged (these are not used in the print statement).

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is 8.

Output: **8**
