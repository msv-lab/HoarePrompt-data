#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists where each inner list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: The variable `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`. The variable `ans` remains 0. The variable `t` and the list of lists remain unchanged.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `cnt` remains unchanged, `ans` is 8, `t` and the list of lists remain unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 8
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the standard input. It then calculates the number of groups of three sticks of the same length that can be formed from the list `a`. The result is printed to the standard output. The function does not accept any parameters, does not return any value, and does not modify any external state.
