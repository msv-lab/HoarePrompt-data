### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `nums`**:
   - The program initializes `nums` as a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). This list has 24 elements, which is within the allowed size of 25.
   - The list `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).

2. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than `k`**:
   - The program finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` by incrementing `idx` until \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\). It then decrements `idx` by 1 to get the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - For example, if `k = 10`, the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 10 is \(2^3 = 8\), so `idx` will be 3.

3. **Modifying the List `nums`**:
   - The program removes \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from `nums` and appends three new elements: `k - 2^{\text{idx}}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1`.
   - For `k = 10` and `idx = 3`, the element \(2^3 = 8\) is removed, and the new elements are `10 - 8 = 2`, `10 + 1 = 11`, and `10 + 8 + 1 = 19`.
   - The modified list `nums` will still have 24 elements.

4. **Ensuring No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
   - The removal of \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and the addition of `k - 2^{\text{idx}}` ensures that no subsequence of `nums` can sum to `k`. This is because the only way to form `k` using the original list was by including \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and other elements, but now \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed and replaced with `k - 2^{\text{idx}}`, which cannot be used to form `k` with the remaining elements.

5. **Ensuring All Other Sums from 1 to `n` are Possible**:
   - The addition of `k + 1` and `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1` ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can still be formed. This is because the new elements can be used to form sums that were previously possible with \(2^{\text{idx}}\).

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the modified `nums` list, which is 24, and the elements of the modified list.
   - This output is valid for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence `nums` that meets the problem's requirements for each test case. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed. The sequence is of size at most 25, and the program handles multiple test cases as required.

**Correctness: True**
