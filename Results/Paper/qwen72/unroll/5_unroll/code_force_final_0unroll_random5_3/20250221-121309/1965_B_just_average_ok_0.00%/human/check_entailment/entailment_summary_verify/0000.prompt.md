You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, modifies a list `nums` that initially contains the first 24 powers of 2, and prints the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the list. The modification involves removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` from `nums` and adding three new elements: `k - 2^idx`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^idx + 1`, where `2^idx` is the removed power of 2. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not always produce a valid sequence that meets the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k` while also ensuring that for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
```

**Expected Output:**
The sequence should be such that:
- There is no subsequence with a sum of 3.
- For all `1 ≤ v ≤ 5` where `v ≠ 3`, there should be a subsequence with a sum of `v`.

A valid sequence for this input could be:
```
4
1 2 4 5
```
This sequence meets the conditions because:
- There is no subsequence that sums to 3.
- Subsequences that sum to 1, 2, 4, and 5 are:
  - 1: [1]
  - 2: [2]
  - 4: [4]
  - 5: [5]
  - 1 + 2 = 3 (but 3 is not allowed)
  - 1 + 4 = 5 (but 5 is already present)

**Actual Output:**
The program generates:
```
24
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2097152 4194304 4194305
```

This sequence does not meet the conditions because:
- It contains 24 elements, which exceeds the maximum allowed size of 25.
- It does not ensure that there is no subsequence with a sum of 3.
- It does not ensure that for all `1 ≤ v ≤ 5` where `v ≠ 3`, there is a subsequence with a sum of `v`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
