The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, modifies a list `nums` that initially contains the first 24 powers of 2, and prints the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the list. The modification involves removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` from `nums` and adding three new elements: `k - 2^idx`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^idx + 1`, where `2^idx` is the removed power of 2. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
