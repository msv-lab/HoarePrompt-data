### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence \( a \) of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of \( a \) sums to \( k \).
     - For all \( 1 \le v \le n \) where \( v \ne k \), there is a subsequence of \( a \) that sums to \( v \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It initializes a list `nums` with the first 24 powers of 2 (i.e., \( 1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23} \)).
   - It finds the largest index \( idx \) such that \( 2^{idx} \le k \).
   - It appends \( k - 2^{idx} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 2^{idx} + 1 \) to the list `nums`.
   - It removes \( 2^{idx} \) from the list `nums`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

3. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - **No Subsequence Sums to \( k \):**
     - The program ensures that \( 2^{idx} \) is removed from the list `nums`, which is a key element in the sum \( k \). This prevents any subsequence from summing to \( k \).
     - The additional elements \( k - 2^{idx} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 2^{idx} + 1 \) are chosen to avoid forming a subsequence that sums to \( k \).

   - **All Other Sums \( 1 \le v \le n \) (where \( v \ne k \)) Are Possible:**
     - The list `nums` initially contains the first 24 powers of 2, which can represent any number up to \( 2^{24} - 1 \) (i.e., 16777215) using subsets.
     - By removing \( 2^{idx} \) and adding \( k - 2^{idx} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 2^{idx} + 1 \), the program ensures that all numbers from 1 to \( n \) (except \( k \)) can still be represented by some subsequence of `nums`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k \) is a power of 2 by removing the exact power of 2 and adding the necessary elements to ensure all other sums are possible.
   - The program also ensures that the size of `nums` does not exceed 25, which is within the problem constraints.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements for all valid inputs.
