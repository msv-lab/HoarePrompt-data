Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined method (e.g., standard input or a provided list of test cases) and process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The coordinates are given in random order, but they are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**
