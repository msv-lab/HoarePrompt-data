Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts no parameters and processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, if `n` is less than 3, the function prints 0. If `n` is 3 or greater, the function prints the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the list such that all three elements are the same or all three elements are distinct. The list `buffer` remains empty throughout the function's execution. **
