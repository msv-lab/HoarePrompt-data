Output State: **The list `buffer` remains empty, and the loop has processed all `t` test cases, printing the result for each test case. For each test case, if `n` is less than 3, the output is 0. If `n` is 3 or greater, the output is the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the list `w` such that all three elements are the same or all three elements are distinct.**
