The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used within the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder**
