Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted correctly. For example, for the input string "0000", the program should output 0, which it does. However, for the input string "1111", the program also outputs 0, which is incorrect. The string "1111" is already sorted, but the function `func_1` does not account for this and should return 0 without any additional checks. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle cases where the string has a pattern that requires minimal cost to sort. For instance, for the input "101011", the program outputs 5, which is correct, but for the input "01101001", the program outputs 11, which is incorrect. The correct minimum cost for "01101001" should be 4, as it can be sorted with the following operations:

1. Choose substring [2, 3]: "01101001" → "00111001"
2. Choose substring [4, 5]: "00111001" → "00011101"
3. Choose substring [6, 7]: "00011101" → "00001111"

The total cost is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which is less than 11. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
