The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integers `t`, `x`, and `n` within the specified ranges and return a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `t`, `x`, and `n` where 1 <= t <= 10^3, 1 <= x <= 10^8, and 1 <= n <= x, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
