Output State: **The loop executes `t` times, and for each test case, it reads an integer `m` and a list of integers `arr`. After processing the list, it prints 'YES' if the list can be made non-decreasing by modifying at most one element, and 'NO' otherwise. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.**
