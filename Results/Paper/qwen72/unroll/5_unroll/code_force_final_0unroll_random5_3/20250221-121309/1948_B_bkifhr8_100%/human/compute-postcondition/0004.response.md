Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `m` and a list of integers `arr`. It then processes the list to check if it can be made non-decreasing by modifying at most one element. After processing, it prints 'YES' if the list can be made non-decreasing by such a modification, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external variables. **
