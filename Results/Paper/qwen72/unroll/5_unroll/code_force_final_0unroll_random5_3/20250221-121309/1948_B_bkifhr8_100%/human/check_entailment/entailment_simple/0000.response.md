Reasoning:

The program provided has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` is not defined to accept the number of test cases `t` as an argument. This is a minor issue but should be corrected to match the problem description.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` but does not use it to control the number of test cases. Instead, it should read `t` and use it to iterate over the test cases.

3. **Logic for Checking Non-decreasing Order**: The logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing is flawed. The program checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by modifying at most one element, but this is not the correct approach for the problem. The problem requires checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation (splitting elements into digits) any number of times.

4. **Incorrect Splitting and Insertion**: The program attempts to split the element at `arr[i - 1]` and checks if the resulting list is sorted. However, it should split the element at `arr[i]` and insert the digits in the same position. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the insertion of digits back into the array.

5. **Early Termination**: The program terminates early if it finds a single element that, when split, does not result in a sorted array. This is incorrect because the operation can be applied multiple times, and the array might still become non-decreasing after further operations.

6. **Handling of Digits**: The program does not correctly handle the insertion of digits back into the array. It should insert the digits of the element at the same position and then continue checking the array.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
