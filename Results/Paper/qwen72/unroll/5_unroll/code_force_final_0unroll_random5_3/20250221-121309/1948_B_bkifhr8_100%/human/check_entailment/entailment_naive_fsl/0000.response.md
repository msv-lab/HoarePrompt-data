Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the transformation and checking of the array. Specifically, the program only checks and transforms the array in a single pass from the end to the beginning. This approach is insufficient because the transformation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array. Additionally, the program incorrectly updates the array by only replacing the current element with the first digit of the split number, which does not maintain the correct order of digits.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

For the second test case:
- Initial array: `[12, 28, 5]`
- The program will check if `28 < 12`, which is false, so it will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and update the array to `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
- Next, it will check if `28 < 2`, which is false, so it will split `28` into `[2, 8]` and update the array to `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.
- Finally, it will check if `8 < 5`, which is false, so it will split `5` into `[5]` and update the array to `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.

The final array `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]` is not sorted, and the program will incorrectly print `YES` instead of `NO`.

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the transformation and sorting requirements for all potential cases.
