### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The function assumes that the array can be sorted (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The function iterates backward through the array from the second last element to the first element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).
   - This is a good approach because if an element is out of order, it needs to be checked against the previous element to see if it can be split to make the array sorted.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - If the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`, the function checks if the previous element can be split into its digits and still maintain a sorted order.
   - The previous element `arr[i - 1]` is split into its digits and combined with the current element `arr[i]` to form a new list `nums`.
   - The function then checks if `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted(nums)`.

5. **Update Array:**
   - If `nums` is sorted, the function updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split number (`arr[i - 1] = nums[0]`).

6. **Output:**
   - If at any point the array cannot be made sorted, the function sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, the function prints `YES` if `ans` is `True` and `NO` otherwise.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Splitting and Comparison:**
  - The function splits the previous element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and combines it with the current element `arr[i]` to form `nums`.
  - However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly handle the insertion of digits in the same position as the original element.
  - For example, if `arr = [12, 3, 45, 67]`, the function will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and combine it with `3` to form `[1, 2, 3]`. This is not the correct way to handle the operation as described in the problem.

- **Incorrect Update:**
  - The function updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split number, which is not the correct way to handle the operation.
  - The correct approach should be to replace `arr[i - 1]` with the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and then check if the array can be sorted.

### Correct Approach:
- **Split and Insert Digits:**
  - For each element `arr[i - 1]` that is at least 10, split it into its digits and insert them in the same position.
  - After splitting, check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the required operation and logic to determine if the array can be sorted. The issues identified in the original assessment are accurate, and the program's approach to splitting and updating the array is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
