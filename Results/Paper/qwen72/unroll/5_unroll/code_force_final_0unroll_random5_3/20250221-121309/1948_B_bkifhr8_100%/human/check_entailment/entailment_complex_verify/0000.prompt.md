You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list. Additionally, the function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, so it should accept an integer `t` for the number of test cases. The integers in the list `a` should be between 0 and 99, and the length `n` should be between 2 and 50.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: The loop executes `t` times, and for each test case, it reads an integer `m` and a list of integers `arr`. After processing the list, it prints 'YES' if the list can be made non-decreasing by modifying at most one element, and 'NO' otherwise. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `m` and a list of integers `arr`. It then processes the list to check if it can be made non-decreasing by modifying at most one element. After processing, it prints 'YES' if the list can be made non-decreasing by such a modification, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external variables.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the transformation and checking of the array. Specifically, the program only checks and transforms the array in a single pass from the end to the beginning. This approach is insufficient because the transformation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array. Additionally, the program incorrectly updates the array by only replacing the current element with the first digit of the split number, which does not maintain the correct order of digits.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

For the second test case:
- Initial array: `[12, 28, 5]`
- The program will check if `28 < 12`, which is false, so it will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and update the array to `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
- Next, it will check if `28 < 2`, which is false, so it will split `28` into `[2, 8]` and update the array to `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.
- Finally, it will check if `8 < 5`, which is false, so it will split `5` into `[5]` and update the array to `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.

The final array `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]` is not sorted, and the program will incorrectly print `YES` instead of `NO`.

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the transformation and sorting requirements for all potential cases.
