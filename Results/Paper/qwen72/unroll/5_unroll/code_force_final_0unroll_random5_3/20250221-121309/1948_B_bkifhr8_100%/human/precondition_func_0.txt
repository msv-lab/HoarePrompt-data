The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list. Additionally, the function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, so it should accept an integer `t` for the number of test cases. The integers in the list `a` should be between 0 and 99, and the length `n` should be between 2 and 50.
