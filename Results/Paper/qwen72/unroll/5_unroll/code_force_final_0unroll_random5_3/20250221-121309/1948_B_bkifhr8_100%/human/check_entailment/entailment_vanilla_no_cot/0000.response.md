Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it checks if the array can be sorted. Specifically, the program checks if the digits of a single element can be sorted, but it does not consider the broader impact of the operation on the entire array. Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Check for Sorting**: The program checks if the digits of a single element can be sorted, but it does not check if the entire array can be sorted after performing the operation. For example, if `arr[i-1]` is 45 and `arr[i]` is 3, the program will split 45 into [4, 5] and check if [4, 5, 3] is sorted, which it is not. However, the correct check should be whether the array can be sorted after all possible operations.

2. **Improper Handling of Digits**: The program adds the digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` together in a list and checks if this list is sorted. This is not the correct way to handle the operation, as the digits should be inserted back into the array in the same position, and the entire array should be checked for sorting.

3. **Early Termination**: The program breaks out of the loop as soon as it finds an unsorted pair, but it should continue to check the entire array to ensure that no further operations can make it sorted.

A correct approach would involve simulating the operation and checking if the array can be sorted after all possible operations. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_sort_array(arr):
    def split_number(num):
        return [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
    
    def is_sorted(arr):
        return all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))
    
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= 10:
            digits = split_number(arr[i])
            arr[i:i+1] = digits  # Replace the element with its digits
            if not is_sorted(arr):
                return False
    return True

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if can_sort_array(arr):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version correctly simulates the operation and checks if the array can be sorted after all possible operations.
