Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from a given set of sticks. A regular polygon requires at least 3 sticks of the same length. The function `func_1` counts the frequency of each stick length and then calculates the number of polygons that can be formed by performing integer division of each frequency by 3. This approach is correct for determining the number of triangles that can be formed, but it does not account for the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides.

For example, in the third test case, the program correctly identifies that 4 sticks of length 3 can form 1 square (4-sided polygon). However, in the fourth test case, the program only counts the number of triangles that can be formed, which is 2 (since 6 sticks of length 2 can form 2 triangles and 3 sticks of length 4 can form 1 triangle), but it fails to recognize that a pentagon (5-sided polygon) can also be formed with the sticks of length 2.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for each stick length, not just triangles. This can be done by performing integer division of each frequency by the number of sides of the polygon (starting from 3 and going up to the frequency itself).

Correctness: **False**
