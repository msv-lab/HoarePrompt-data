You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of arr is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `freq` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `arr`, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in `arr`. The list `arr` remains unchanged.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each stick length by 3. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of sticks of a certain length is not a multiple of 3 but is greater than 3. For example, if there are 4 sticks of the same length, the program will only count 1 polygon, but it should be able to form 1 polygon with 3 sticks and leave 1 stick unused, which is still the maximum number of polygons that can be formed. 

Consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```
The expected output should be `1` because we can form a square (which is a regular polygon) with 4 sticks of the same length. However, the program will output `1` but it should actually output `1` and leave the remaining stick unused, which is still the correct maximum number of polygons. The program's logic is flawed in this case. 

To correct this, the program should consider the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with any number of sticks greater than or equal to 3, not just multiples of 3. The correct approach would be to use `v // 3` to count the number of polygons, but also ensure that any remaining sticks are not counted as part of a polygon. The current implementation is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sticks of the same length.
