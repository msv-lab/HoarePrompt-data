You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.

        del list2[:]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `a` is the last input integer read in the loop, `num` is the input string, `out` is a list of `int(num)` integers where each integer is the sum of the first `n` sorted integers from the corresponding input list.
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)
        
    #State: The loop prints each integer in the list `out`, which contains `int(num)` integers. Each integer in `out` is the sum of the first `n` sorted integers from the corresponding input list. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `num` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of integers in ascending order. This is a crucial step because to maximize the score, we should always choose the smallest available numbers to add to the score. Sorting ensures that we can easily pick the smallest numbers.

3. **Selecting Minimum Values**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list and selects every second element starting from the first (i.e., `list1[2 * i]` for `i` in `range(a)`). This is correct because in a sorted list, the smallest `n` elements will be the first `n` elements, and the program is effectively picking the smallest element from each pair of elements.

4. **Summing the Selected Values**:
   - The program sums the selected minimum values and appends the result to the `out` list. This is the correct way to calculate the score for each test case.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case after processing all test cases.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all numbers are the same correctly, as the sorted list will still allow the program to pick the smallest elements.

### Potential Issues:
- **Input Format**: The program uses `input()` and `input('')` to read the number of pairs and the list of integers, respectively. The `input('')` with an empty string as a prompt is unnecessary and can be simplified to just `input()`.
- **List Deletion**: The program uses `del list1[:]` and `del list2[:]` to clear the lists after each test case. While this is not strictly necessary (as the lists are reinitialized in the next iteration), it does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case by sorting the list and selecting the minimum values, and outputs the correct results.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
