The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer provided by the user, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
