Output State: **The loop has processed all test cases, and for each query, it has printed the minimum travel cost between the cities x_i and y_i. The variables `t`, `n`, `lst`, `m`, `start`, `end`, `inc`, `s`, `d1`, and `d2` have been updated and used within the loop, but their final values are not retained for the next test case. The loop ends after processing all queries for all test cases, and the program is ready to terminate or accept new input.**
