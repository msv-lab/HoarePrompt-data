Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of cities and their coordinates, then calculates the minimum travel cost for a series of queries. Each query specifies two cities, and the function prints the minimum travel cost between these cities. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the state of the program is such that all input has been processed and the corresponding minimum travel costs have been printed for each query. **
