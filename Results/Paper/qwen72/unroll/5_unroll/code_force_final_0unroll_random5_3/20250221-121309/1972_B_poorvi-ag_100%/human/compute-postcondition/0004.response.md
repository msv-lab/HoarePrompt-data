The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must be a non-empty list. Since `results` is supposed to contain a list of strings ('yes' or 'no') and its length is equal to `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 and `results` is initialized with at least one element.

State: **`results` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `results`**
