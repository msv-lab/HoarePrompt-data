You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n consisting of "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: The variable `results` will contain a list of strings, each either 'yes' or 'no', corresponding to whether the count of 'U' in each input string `arr` is odd or even, respectively. The length of `results` will be equal to `t`.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The variable `results` remains unchanged, containing a list of strings, each either 'yes' or 'no', corresponding to whether the count of 'U' in each input string `arr` is odd or even, respectively. The length of `results` is still equal to `t`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a circle of `n` coins, each of which can be either "U" (facing up) or "D" (facing down).
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., no facing-up coins left) loses.
   - We need to determine if Alice will win the game if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The game is essentially about the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have a move to make, and she can force Bob into a position where he has an even number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is the one who eventually runs out of moves.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - It then checks the count of 'U' (facing-up coins) in the string `arr`.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'yes' to the results list, indicating that Alice will win.
   - If the count of 'U' is even, it appends 'no' to the results list, indicating that Bob will win.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The program correctly identifies the winning condition based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The logic is sound because if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make a move and force Bob into a losing position.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force her into a losing position.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are no facing-up coins correctly by appending 'no' (Bob wins).
   - It also handles the case where there is only one coin correctly by appending 'yes' (Alice wins) if it is facing up, and 'no' if it is facing down.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem.
