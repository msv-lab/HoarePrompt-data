#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n consisting of "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: The variable `results` will contain a list of strings, each either 'yes' or 'no', corresponding to whether the count of 'U' in each input string `arr` is odd or even, respectively. The length of `results` will be equal to `t`.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The variable `results` remains unchanged, containing a list of strings, each either 'yes' or 'no', corresponding to whether the count of 'U' in each input string `arr` is odd or even, respectively. The length of `results` is still equal to `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the input, where `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D". The function then determines if the count of "U" in `s` is odd or even and appends "yes" or "no" to a list `results` accordingly. After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in `results`, indicating whether the count of "U" in each test case is odd ("yes") or even ("no"). The function does not return any value.
