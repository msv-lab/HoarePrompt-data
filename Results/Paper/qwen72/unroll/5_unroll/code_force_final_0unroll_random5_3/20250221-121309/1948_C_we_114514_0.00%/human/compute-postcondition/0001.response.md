The only objects in the loop head are `test_case` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least one test case, the loop will execute. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The `results` list is also not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list**
