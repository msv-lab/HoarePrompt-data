Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem description. It precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers up to 200,001 (which is slightly more than the maximum value of \( n \) as specified in the problem) and stores these sums in a list. This allows for efficient retrieval of the sum for any given \( n \) within the specified range during the actual test cases.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
   - `inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1` sets the upper limit for precomputation.
   - `values = [0] * inf` initializes a list to store the cumulative sums of digit sums.
   - The loop `for i in range(1, inf):` iterates through each number from 1 to 200,001.
   - For each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits by converting the number to a string and summing the integer values of its characters.
   - It then updates the `values` list with the cumulative sum of digit sums up to that number.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - `t = int(input())` reads the number of test cases.
   - The loop `for _ in range(t):` iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and prints the precomputed cumulative sum of digit sums for that value from the `values` list.

This approach ensures that the program can handle up to \( 10^4 \) test cases within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test, as the precomputation step is done only once and the retrieval of results for each test case is \( O(1) \).
