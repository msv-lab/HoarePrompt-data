The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` is a list of integers where each element represents the largest number for each test case, with the constraint 1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates some computation or determination based on the largest number for that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of integers `n` where each element is the largest number for each test case. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case based on the largest number provided.**
