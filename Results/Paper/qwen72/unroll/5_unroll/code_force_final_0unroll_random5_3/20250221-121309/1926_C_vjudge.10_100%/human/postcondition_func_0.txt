The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads `t` integers, each representing a value for a test case. It calculates the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to 200000 and stores these sums in a list `values`. For each test case, it prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to the given value. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The list `values` and the integer `t` remain unchanged after the function concludes.
