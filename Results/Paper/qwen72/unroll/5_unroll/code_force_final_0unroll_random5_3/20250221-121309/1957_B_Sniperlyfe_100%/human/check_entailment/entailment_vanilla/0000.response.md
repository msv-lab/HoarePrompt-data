### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all the integers in the sequence.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is designed to generate such a sequence.
   - The first element of the sequence is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - This ensures that the first element has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
   - The remaining sum `k` is then distributed among the other elements of the sequence, ensuring that each element is as large as possible without exceeding the remaining sum.

3. **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `nums = [0] * n` initializes a list of `n` zeros.
   - **First Element:**
     - `nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` sets the first element to the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
     - `k -= nums[0]` updates the remaining sum `k` after setting the first element.
   - **Distributing Remaining Sum:**
     - The loop `for i in range(1, n)` iterates over the remaining elements.
     - `nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)` sets each subsequent element to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining sum `k`.
     - `k -= nums[i]` updates the remaining sum after setting each element.
   - **Final Adjustment:**
     - `nums[0] += k` adds any remaining sum to the first element to ensure the total sum is exactly `k`.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - **Sum Condition:**
     - The sum of the elements in the sequence is always equal to `k` because any remaining sum after the loop is added to the first element.
   - **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation:**
     - The first element is set to the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`, which maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation.
     - The subsequent elements are set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining sum, ensuring that they do not exceed the remaining sum and contribute to the bitwise OR operation.
     - The final adjustment ensures that the sum is exactly `k` and does not affect the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Element (n = 1):**
     - The sequence will contain only one element, which is `k` itself.
   - **Small `k` and Large `n`:**
     - If `k` is small and `n` is large, the remaining elements will be set to 0 after the first element is set, which is valid as the sum condition is still satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all the integers in the sequence.

**Correctness: True**
