To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `i` starts at 1 and the loop will run as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and all other elements initialized to 0.
- `k` is now `k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)`.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, and `i` should start at 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and all other elements initialized to 0, `k` is now `k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)`**
