Precondition: **num is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer in num satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the list of integers and the parameters n and m. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def game_winner(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, and the list of integers `a`. For each tuple, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, and `a` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(a) ≤ n and each integer in `a` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
