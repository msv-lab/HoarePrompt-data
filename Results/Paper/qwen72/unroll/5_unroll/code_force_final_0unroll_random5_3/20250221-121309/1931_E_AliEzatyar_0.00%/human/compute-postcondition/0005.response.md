The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and each integer in the list is between 1 and 1,000,000,000 (inclusive). The function returns the number of trailing zeros in the list `num`, and the rest of the list `num` remains unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `num` and returns the number of trailing zeros in the list, while the rest of the list remains unchanged.**
