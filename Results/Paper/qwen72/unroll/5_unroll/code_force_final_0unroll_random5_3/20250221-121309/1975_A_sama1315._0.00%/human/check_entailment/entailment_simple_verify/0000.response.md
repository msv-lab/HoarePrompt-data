### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. It does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a non-decreasing order. This is a critical flaw in the program, as it fails to handle cases where the array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' without considering the possibility of splitting and swapping the array.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted.
   - The results for each test case are stored in the `results` list and printed at the end.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - However, they do not address the logical flaw in `func_1`.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
  - The array is not sorted.
  - The function `func_1` returns 'No'.
  - This is correct because no amount of splitting and swapping can make this array sorted in non-decreasing order.

- **Test Case 2**: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
  - The array is not sorted.
  - The function `func_1` returns 'No'.
  - This is incorrect because the array can be sorted by splitting it into `[7]` and `[9, 2, 2, 3]` and then swapping these parts to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`, and performing the operation again to get `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`.

- **Test Case 3**: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - The array is already sorted.
  - The function `func_1` returns 'Yes'.
  - This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program as written is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts. The original assessment correctly identified this flaw.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
