### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - **Issue:** The function does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a non-decreasing order. This is a critical flaw because the problem specifically allows for such operations.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly initializes the index to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted by the given operation.
   - The results for each test case are collected in a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.
   - **Issue:** The function `func_2` relies on `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted, but `func_1` is incorrect as it only checks if the array is already sorted and does not account for the allowed operations.

### Analysis Using Annotated Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - **State Before Function Call:** `arr` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= len(arr) <= 50.
  - **State After Function Call:** The function returns 'Yes' if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and 'No' otherwise.
  - **Annotation:** The function correctly identifies if the array is already sorted, but it does not check if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts. This means the function is incomplete and does not solve the problem as described.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - **State Before Function Call:** `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `arr` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= arr_i <= 10^6.
  - **State After Function Call:** The function processes `t` test cases, reads the array lengths and elements, calls `func_1` for each array, and collects the results in a list `results`.
  - **Annotation:** The function correctly reads and processes the input, but it uses `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted, which is incorrect. The function does not implement the logic to check if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations of splitting and swapping parts.

### Correctness:
**False**
