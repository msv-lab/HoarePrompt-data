### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through each element of the array starting from the second element.
   - It checks if the array is not already sorted using `func_1`.
   - If the array is not sorted and the current element is greater than the previous element and the previous element is greater than 10, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array in the correct positions.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version.
   - This function is correctly implemented and does not modify the input list.

4. **Output:**
   - After attempting to sort the array using the operations, the program checks if the array is sorted using `func_1`.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Operation Application:**
  - The program only applies the operation to the previous element (`list1[p - 1]`) if it is greater than 10 and the current element (`list1[p]`) is smaller.
  - This approach is not sufficient because the operation can be applied to any element greater than or equal to 10, regardless of its position relative to the next element.
  - For example, in the array `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will not split `28` because it is not greater than the next element `5`. However, splitting `28` into `2` and `8` would make the array `[12, 2, 8, 5]`, which can then be further sorted by splitting `12` into `1` and `2`.

- **Inefficient and Incomplete Sorting:**
  - The program only performs the operation once per element, which is not enough to ensure the array is sorted.
  - The operation should be applied multiple times until no more elements can be split or the array is sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the operation of splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 and does not ensure that the array is fully sorted after applying the operation multiple times.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
