### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common approach for handling multiple test cases in competitive programming.
   - The first element of the list is the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Calculating the Year of the N-th Sign:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`, which is the year the first sign occurs.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur. The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1\right) // a[i] \times a[i]
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - The `last_year` is then updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program writes the results to `sys.stdout` in the required format, with each result on a new line.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly, as it initializes `last_year` to `a[0]` and appends it to the results list.
   - The program also handles the edge case where all periodicities are 1, as the formula will correctly calculate the next year for each sign.

5. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula \(\left(\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1\right) // a[i] \times a[i]\) ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`. This is correct because:
     - \(\text{last\_year} + 1\) is the year immediately after the last sign.
     - Adding \(a[i] - 1\) and then performing integer division by `a[i]` and multiplying back by `a[i]` ensures that the result is the next multiple of `a[i]`.

6. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic of the program follows the problem description accurately. It correctly calculates the year in which each sign will occur, ensuring that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. It handles all edge cases and uses the correct formula to calculate the year of the N-th sign.

Correctness: **True**
