Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**

The input is read and split into a list of strings, which is stored in the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged and still satisfy their initial conditions.
