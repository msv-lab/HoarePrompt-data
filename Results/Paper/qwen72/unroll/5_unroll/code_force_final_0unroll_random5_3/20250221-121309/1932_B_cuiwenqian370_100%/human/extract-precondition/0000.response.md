It seems there was a mistake in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take parameters for the number of signs and the list of periodicities. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```python
def func_1(t, n, a):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.**
