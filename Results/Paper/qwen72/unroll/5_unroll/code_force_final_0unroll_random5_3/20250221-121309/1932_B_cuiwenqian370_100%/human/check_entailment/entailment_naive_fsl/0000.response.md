Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, as described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the year for the n-th sign to occur by ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The calculation `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next sign occurs in the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year + 1`, which aligns with the problem's requirement. The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs as described in the problem statement.
