### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling input in a competitive programming context where the entire input is read and processed in one go.
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `T` and the number of signs `n` for each test case.
   - The list `a` is correctly populated with the periodicities of the signs for each test case.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The initial year for the first sign is set to `a[0]`, which is correct as the first sign occurs every `a[0]` years.
   - For each subsequent sign, the program calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
     This formula ensures that the next sign occurs in the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year + 1`. Let's break it down:
     - `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i]` calculates the smallest integer `k` such that `k * a[i]` is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
     - Multiplying `k` by `a[i]` gives the next year in which the sign will occur.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in the list `results` as strings.
   - The final output is written to standard output using `sys.stdout.write`, with each result on a new line. This is consistent with the problem's output requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly. If there is only one sign, the year in which it occurs is simply `a[0]`.
   - The program also handles the case where all signs have the same periodicity (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1`) correctly. In this case, the signs will occur in consecutive years, and the final year will be `n`.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case (`3 2 4 5 9 18`):
     - The first sign occurs in year 3.
     - The second sign occurs in year 4 (next multiple of 2 after 3).
     - The third sign occurs in year 8 (next multiple of 4 after 4).
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 10 (next multiple of 5 after 8).
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 18 (next multiple of 9 after 10).
     - The sixth sign occurs in year 36 (next multiple of 18 after 18).
   - For the second test case (`1 2 3 4 5`):
     - The first sign occurs in year 1.
     - The second sign occurs in year 2 (next multiple of 2 after 1).
     - The third sign occurs in year 3 (next multiple of 3 after 2).
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 4 (next multiple of 4 after 3).
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 5 (next multiple of 5 after 4).
   - For the third test case (`1 1 1 1 1`):
     - The first sign occurs in year 1.
     - The second sign occurs in year 2.
     - The third sign occurs in year 3.
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.
   - For the fourth test case (`50 30 711 200 503 1006`):
     - The first sign occurs in year 50.
     - The second sign occurs in year 60 (next multiple of 30 after 50).
     - The third sign occurs in year 1422 (next multiple of 711 after 60).
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 1600 (next multiple of 200 after 1422).
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 2012 (next multiple of 503 after 1600).
     - The sixth sign occurs in year 2012 (next multiple of 1006 after 2012).

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, as described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly.

Final: **True**
