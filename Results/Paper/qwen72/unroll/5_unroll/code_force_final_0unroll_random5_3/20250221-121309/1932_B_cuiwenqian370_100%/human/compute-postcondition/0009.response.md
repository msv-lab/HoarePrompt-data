The function `func_1` does not have any parameters listed in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships provided, it seems there might be a mistake in the function signature. Assuming the function should accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.

Given this information, the function `func_1` is expected to return a value based on these inputs. However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the problem statement. Without the output details, the functionality can only be described in terms of what it accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 1000), `n` (an integer between 1 and 100), and `a` (a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^6).**
