You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept multiple test cases, each with an array c of positive integers and a set of queries. Specifically, the input should be structured such that the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array c and the number of queries, respectively. The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array c. The following q lines each contain two integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the i-th subarray. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: The list `b` will contain cumulative sums where each element is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in `a` (excluding the first element, which is 0) is greater than 1, or by 2 otherwise. The length of `b` will still be `n + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The list `a` will contain cumulative sums of its original values, and the list `b` will still contain cumulative sums where each element (excluding the first element, which is 0) is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in the new `a` (after cumulative sum) is greater than 1, or by 2 otherwise. The length of `b` will still be `n + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and the original `a` remain unchanged. The loop will print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the comparison of the differences between the cumulative sums of `a` and `b` for each query, and the final state of `a` and `b` will be the same as their state after the cumulative sums and adjustments are applied.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each with an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries. It returns the results for each query, where each query specifies a subarray of `c` defined by its borders `l_i` and `r_i`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
