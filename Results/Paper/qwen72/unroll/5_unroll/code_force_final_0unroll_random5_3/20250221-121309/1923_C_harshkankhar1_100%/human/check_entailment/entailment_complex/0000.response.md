### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It reads the array `c` and processes it.

2. **Cumulative Sums:**
   - The program creates a list `a` which is the cumulative sum of the array `c`.
   - It also creates a list `b` which is the cumulative sum of a modified array where each element is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in `c` is greater than 1, or by 2 otherwise.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l_i` and `r_i`.
   - It checks if the sum of the subarray `c[l_i]` to `c[r_i]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in the modified array `b`.
   - If the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b`, or if the subarray is a single element (`x == y`), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

4. **Conditions for a Good Subarray:**
   - A subarray is good if there exists another array `b` such that:
     - The sum of the subarray in `a` equals the sum of the subarray in `b`.
     - Each element in the subarray of `a` is different from the corresponding element in the subarray of `b`.
     - Each element in the subarray of `b` is greater than 0.
   - The program ensures that the sum of the subarray in `b` is always greater than or equal to the sum of the subarray in `a` by incrementing each element in `b` by at least 1.
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` ensures that the sum of the subarray in `a` is not greater than the sum of the subarray in `b`.
   - The condition `x == y` ensures that the subarray is not a single element, which cannot be good because `a_i` would be equal to `b_i` in that case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the subarray is a single element correctly by printing 'NO'.
   - It also handles the case where the subarray is the entire array or any other valid subarray.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
