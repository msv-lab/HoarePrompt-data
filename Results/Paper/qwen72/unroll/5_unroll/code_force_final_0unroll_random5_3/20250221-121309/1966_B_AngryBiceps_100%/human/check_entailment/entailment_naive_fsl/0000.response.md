Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns for uniformity, but it does not consider the entire grid. This can lead to incorrect outputs in cases where the first and last rows or columns are uniform, but the rest of the grid is not.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3 3
W B W
B W B
W B W
```
In this grid, the first and last rows are both "W B W" and the first and last columns are both "W B W". However, the grid cannot be made uniform with the given operations because the middle row and column are different from the rest. The program will incorrectly output "YES" for this case, which should be "NO".

Thus, the program is incorrect.
