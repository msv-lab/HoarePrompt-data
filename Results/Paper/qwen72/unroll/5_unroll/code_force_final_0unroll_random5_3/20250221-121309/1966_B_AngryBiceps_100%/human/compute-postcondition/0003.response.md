Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from input, representing the dimensions of a grid, and then reads `n` strings of length `m` to construct the grid. The function checks if the first row and last row of the grid are entirely composed of the same character ('W' or 'B') and are different from each other, or if the first column and last column of the grid are entirely composed of the same character and are different from each other. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and the grid `a` are no longer in scope. **
