You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500, and the grid is a list of n strings, each of length m, containing only the characters 'W' and 'B'.

            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop executes for `t` iterations, and for each iteration, it reads `n` and `m` from input, constructs a grid `a` of size `n` by `m` from input, and checks if the first row and last row of the grid are either entirely 'W' or 'B' and different from each other, or if the first and last columns of the grid are entirely 'W' or 'B' and different from each other. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and the grid `a` are no longer in scope, and the initial state variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns for uniformity, but it does not consider the entire grid. This can lead to incorrect outputs in cases where the first and last rows or columns are uniform, but the rest of the grid is not.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3 3
W B W
B W B
W B W
```
In this grid, the first and last rows are both "W B W" and the first and last columns are both "W B W". However, the grid cannot be made uniform with the given operations because the middle row and column are different from the rest. The program will incorrectly output "YES" for this case, which should be "NO".

Thus, the program is incorrect.
