Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if it's possible to make all squares in a grid the same color by performing operations that change the color of all squares within a subrectangle defined by two selected squares of the same color. The key insight is that if the first and last rows or the first and last columns are entirely composed of the same color but are different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid a single color. This is because any operation that affects both the first and last rows (or columns) would have to make them the same color, which contradicts the condition that they are different.

However, the program's logic has a critical flaw. It only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns, but it does not consider the entire grid. Specifically, the program should check if there are any 'W' and 'B' in the grid. If there are both 'W' and 'B' present, it is impossible to make the entire grid a single color unless the grid is a 1x1 grid (which is always possible).

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the issues:
1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the 1x1 grid case, where the answer is always "YES".
2. **First and Last Rows/Columns Check**: The program checks if the first and last rows or the first and last columns are entirely the same color but different from each other. This is a valid check, but it is not sufficient to determine the correctness for all cases.
3. **Missing Check for Mixed Colors**: The program does not check if there are both 'W' and 'B' in the grid. If the grid contains both colors, it is impossible to make the entire grid a single color unless the grid is 1x1.

To fix this, the program should include a check to see if both 'W' and 'B' are present in the grid. If they are, and the grid is not 1x1, the answer should be "NO".

Given the current implementation, the program will fail for test cases where the grid contains both 'W' and 'B' but the first and last rows/columns do not meet the specific conditions checked.

Correctness: **False**
