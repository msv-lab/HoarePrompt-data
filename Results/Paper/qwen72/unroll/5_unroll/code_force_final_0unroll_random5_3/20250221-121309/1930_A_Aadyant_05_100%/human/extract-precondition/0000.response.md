Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers on the whiteboard for each test case.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to include the parameters as described. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers on the whiteboard for each test case.**
