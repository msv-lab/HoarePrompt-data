The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of 2n integers from the user, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the elements at even indices. The function then prints the sum for each test case. The function does not return any value, but it prints a list of `t` integers, each being the sum of the elements at even indices of a sorted list of integers input by the user. The final state of the program is that `t` remains an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` remains a string, and the `final` list contains `t` integers.
