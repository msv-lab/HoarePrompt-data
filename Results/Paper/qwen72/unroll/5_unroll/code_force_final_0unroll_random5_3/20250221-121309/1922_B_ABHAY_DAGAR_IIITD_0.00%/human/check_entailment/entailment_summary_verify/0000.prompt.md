You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
func_1(t)

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        num_of_lens = {}
        for x in num_list:
            if x in num_of_lens:
                num_of_lens[x] += 1
            else:
                num_of_lens[x] = 1
        res = 0
        total_count = 0
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
            if cnt >= 2:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
            total_count += cnt
        results.append(res)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the exponents of the lengths of sticks. It processes each test case to calculate the number of ways to form triangles using the sticks and appends these counts to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result to the console. The function does not return any value, but the `results` list contains the number of ways to form triangles for each test case, and the `test_cases` list remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the formation of non-degenerate triangles. Specifically, the program only considers cases where there are at least three sticks of the same length or two sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length. However, it does not account for the possibility of forming a triangle with three different sticks.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The lengths of the sticks are \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4\) which are \(2, 4, 8, 16\). The program will output `0` because it does not consider the possibility of forming a triangle with three different sticks. However, a non-degenerate triangle can be formed with sticks of lengths \(2, 4, 8\) (since \(2 + 4 > 8\), \(2 + 8 > 4\), and \(4 + 8 > 2\)), and the correct output should be `1`.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases for forming non-degenerate triangles.
