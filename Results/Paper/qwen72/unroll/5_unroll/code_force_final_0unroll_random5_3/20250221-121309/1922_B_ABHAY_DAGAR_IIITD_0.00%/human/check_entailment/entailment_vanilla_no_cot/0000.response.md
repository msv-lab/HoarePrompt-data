Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks from the given list such that a non-degenerate triangle can be formed. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Counting Stick Lengths**: For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`. It then counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary `num_of_lens`.
3. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - **Same Length Sticks**: If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, the program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from these using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \).
   - **Two Sticks of the Same Length and One Different**: If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, the program calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from these and one stick from the previously counted sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \) and multiplies it by the total count of previously counted sticks.
4. **Updating Total Count**: The program updates the total count of sticks after processing each unique stick length.
5. **Output Results**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The logic ensures that all valid combinations of sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle are counted correctly. The constraints and input handling are also managed appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
