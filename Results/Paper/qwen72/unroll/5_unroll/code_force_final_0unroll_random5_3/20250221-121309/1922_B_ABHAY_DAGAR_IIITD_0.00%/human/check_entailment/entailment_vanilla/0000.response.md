### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and calls the function `func_1(t)`.
   - This is correct as it follows the problem's input format.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(test_cases)` is defined to handle multiple test cases.
   - This is appropriate for the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`.
   - It then counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary `num_of_lens`.
   - This is correct and efficient for counting the frequencies of each length.

4. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of valid triangles.
   - It also initializes `total_count` to 0, which will keep track of the total number of sticks processed so far.

5. **Triangle Formation Logic:**
   - **Case 1: All three sticks have the same length (`cnt >= 3`):**
     - The program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `cnt` sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \).
     - This is correct because it counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from a set of identical sticks.
   - **Case 2: Two sticks have the same length and one stick has a different length (`cnt >= 2`):**
     - The program calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from `cnt` sticks and one stick from the previously processed sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times total_count = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \times total_count \).
     - This is correct because it counts the number of ways to choose 2 identical sticks and one different stick.
   - **Updating `total_count`:**
     - The program updates `total_count` by adding the current count `cnt`.
     - This is correct as it keeps track of the total number of sticks processed so far.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result `res` to the `results` list and prints each result after processing all test cases.
   - This is correct as it follows the problem's output format.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input and output formats, counts the frequencies of stick lengths, and applies the correct logic to determine the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
