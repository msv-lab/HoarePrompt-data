The function `func_2` accepts a non-negative integer `t` representing the current time step in the game. It identifies players in the `player` dictionary whose values match `blud` and sets their values to `[-1, -1]`. It returns nothing but prints the current time step `t`, the player ID, and the string 'ELIMINATED' for each identified player, in ascending order of player IDs. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the function execution.
