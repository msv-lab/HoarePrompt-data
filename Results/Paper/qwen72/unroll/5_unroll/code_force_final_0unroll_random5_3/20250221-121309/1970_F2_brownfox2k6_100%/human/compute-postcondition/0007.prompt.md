You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer representing the current time step in the game.
def func_2(t):
    out = []
    for p in player:
        if player[p] == blud:
            out.append(p)
            player[p] = [-1, -1]
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step in the game, `out` is a list containing the keys (player IDs) of players that were equal to `blud`, and the values of these players in the `player` dictionary have been set to `[-1, -1]`. The state of `t` remains unchanged.
    for p in sorted(out):
        print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the list `out` contains the player IDs that were equal to `blud`. The values of these players in the `player` dictionary have been set to `[-1, -1]`. The loop prints the current time step `t`, the player ID `p`, and the string 'ELIMINATED' for each player ID in `out`, in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-negative integer `t` representing the current time step in the game and returns a value based on the current time step.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
