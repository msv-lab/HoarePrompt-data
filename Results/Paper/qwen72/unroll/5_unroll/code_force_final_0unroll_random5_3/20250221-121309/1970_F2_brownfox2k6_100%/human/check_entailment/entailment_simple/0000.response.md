**Reasoning:**

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input dimensions `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes lists for red goals (`rg`), blue goals (`bg`), and the Bludger (`blud`), and a dictionary for player positions (`player`).
   - It correctly identifies the initial positions of goals, the Quaffle, the Bludger, and players.

2. **Game Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of steps `T` and processes each step.
   - For each step, it parses the entity performing the action (`p`) and the action itself (`d`).

3. **Action Handling:**
   - **Catch Action (`C`):**
     - The program correctly sets the `carry` variable to the player ID if the player catches the Quaffle.
   - **Throw Action (`T`):**
     - The program correctly resets the `carry` variable to `None` when the player throws the Quaffle.
     - It checks if the Quaffle is in a goal and updates the score accordingly.
     - It prints the goal event and resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field.
   - **Movement Actions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`):**
     - The program uses `func_1` to update the position of the entity (Quaffle, Bludger, or player) based on the direction.
     - For the Bludger, it also calls `func_2` to handle player eliminations.

4. **Movement Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function correctly updates the position of the entity based on the direction (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
   - The function ensures that the entity's position is updated correctly and remains within the field boundaries (though this is not explicitly checked, it is assumed valid as per the problem statement).

5. **Elimination Function (`func_2`):**
   - The function correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same position as the Bludger.
   - It prints the elimination events in the required format and order.
   - It sets the eliminated player's position to `[-1, -1]` to mark them as out of the game.

6. **Final Score Output:**
   - The program prints the final score in the correct format after processing all steps.

**Issues:**
- **Bludger Movement and Elimination:**
  - The program correctly handles the Bludger's movement and player eliminations.
  - However, the program does not explicitly check if a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle and if the Quaffle remains in the correct position. This is a potential issue, but the problem statement guarantees that this scenario does not occur.

- **Quaffle Movement:**
  - The program correctly moves the Quaffle when a player carrying it moves.
  - It also correctly handles the Quaffle's reset position when a goal is scored.

- **Goal Scoring:**
  - The program correctly identifies and scores goals based on the player's team and the goal's type.
  - It prints the goal events and updates the score accordingly.

**Conclusion:**
Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to handle all the required scenarios correctly. The only potential issue is the guarantee that a player is not eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, but this is stated in the problem description.

**Correctness: **True****
