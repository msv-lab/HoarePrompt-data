Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers, and stores them in a list `a` of four tuples. This matches the problem description.

2. **Extracting X-coordinates**: The function extracts the x-coordinates from the list of tuples and stores them in the list `x`. This is done correctly using a list comprehension.

3. **Calculating Side Length**: The function calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) will give the side length of the square.

4. **Calculating Area**: The function then calculates the area of the square by squaring the side length (`dx * dx`) and prints it. This is the correct way to calculate the area of a square.

5. **Loop and State**: The function correctly processes each test case in the loop, and the variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` are overwritten in each iteration, which is expected behavior. The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged, and the list of test cases is not modified, which is also correct.

6. **Output**: The function prints the area of the square for each test case, which matches the problem's output requirement.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
