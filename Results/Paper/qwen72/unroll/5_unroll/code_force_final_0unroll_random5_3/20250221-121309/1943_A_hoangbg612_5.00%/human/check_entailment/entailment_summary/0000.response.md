Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the final score of the game based on the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The strategy for both players is crucial, and the program should reflect an optimal play.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the array `N`. Sorting is a good approach to simplify the process of finding the MEX, as it allows us to easily track the smallest missing integer.

3. **Tracking MEX**: The program uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the counts of each integer in the sorted array `N`. It iterates through the sorted array and updates the current integer `cur` and the dictionary `M`.

4. **Optimal Play**: The program's logic for determining the MEX is based on the idea that Alice and Bob will play optimally. Alice will try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it. The program checks if the current integer `cur` is present in the array and if the next integer is missing. If an integer greater than `cur + 1` is found, the loop breaks, indicating that `cur + 1` is the MEX.

5. **Final MEX Calculation**: After the initial loop, the program checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1, which is a step to ensure that all integers from 0 to `cur` are present in the array. Then, it iterates through the range of `cur` to find the smallest integer `i` such that the count of `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`, which is the final MEX.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Dictionary Initialization**: The dictionary `M` is not initialized properly. It should be initialized to handle all possible integers from 0 to `S-1` with a default count of 0.
- **Count Increment**: The program incorrectly increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M` instead of the count of `num`.
- **Final MEX Calculation**: The final loop to determine the MEX is not necessary if the initial loop breaks correctly. The MEX should be determined by the first integer that is missing in the sorted array.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players.

Correctness: **False**
