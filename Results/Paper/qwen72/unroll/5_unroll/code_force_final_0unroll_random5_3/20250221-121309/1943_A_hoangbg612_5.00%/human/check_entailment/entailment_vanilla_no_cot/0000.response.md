Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical and implementation errors that prevent it from correctly determining the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

1. **Initialization and Increment of `cur`:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1` and is incremented to the smallest unique number in the sorted list `N`. However, this approach does not correctly handle the case where the smallest number in `N` is greater than 0. For example, if `N` starts with a number greater than 0, `cur` will be incorrectly set to 0.

2. **Dictionary `M` Usage:**
   - The dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each number in `N`. However, the logic for updating `M` and `cur` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if num > cur + 1` is incorrect because it breaks the loop prematurely, and the condition `if M[i] <= i` is also incorrect for determining the MEX.

3. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - The final MEX calculation logic is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c`. The program's logic does not correctly handle this.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program does not correctly simulate the optimal play strategy for both Alice and Bob. Alice should always try to maximize the MEX, and Bob should always try to minimize it. The current logic does not reflect this strategy.

Here is a corrected version of the program that correctly simulates the optimal play strategy and calculates the MEX:

```python
def mex_of_array(c):
    mex = 0
    while mex in c:
        mex += 1
    return mex

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        c = []
        for i in range(S):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                c.append(N.pop(0))
            else:  # Bob's turn
                N.pop(0)
        print(mex_of_array(c))

def mex_of_array(c):
    mex = 0
    while mex in c:
        mex += 1
    return mex

# Example usage
func()
```

**Explanation of the Corrected Program:**

1. **Function `mex_of_array`:**
   - This function calculates the MEX of the array `c` by starting from 0 and incrementing until it finds a number that is not in `c`.

2. **Main Function `func`:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to ensure that the smallest elements are considered first.
   - It initializes an empty array `c` to store the elements chosen by Alice.
   - It simulates the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob. Alice always picks the smallest available element and appends it to `c`, while Bob picks the smallest available element and discards it.
   - After the game ends, it prints the MEX of the array `c`.

This corrected program should correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
