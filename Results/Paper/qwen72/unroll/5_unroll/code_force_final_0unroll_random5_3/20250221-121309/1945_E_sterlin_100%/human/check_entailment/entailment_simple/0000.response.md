### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x` using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` using `func_3()`.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The program initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to `n`.
   - It performs a binary search loop where it calculates the midpoint `mid` and updates `left` or `right` based on the value at `p[mid]` compared to `x`.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - After the binary search loop, if `p[left]` is equal to `x`, the program prints 0, indicating no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` is not seen in the `seen` array, the program prints 1 and the indices to swap `left + 1` and `num_indx[x]`.
   - If `x` is seen but not at `p[left]`, the program prints 2 and the indices to swap `num_indx[temp[0]]`, `num_indx[x]`, and `num_indx[temp[0]]`, `left + 1`.

4. **Correctness of Binary Search**:
   - The binary search is implemented correctly for a sorted array, but the permutation `p` is not guaranteed to be sorted. The program attempts to correct this by allowing up to 2 swaps.

5. **Swapping to Ensure Correctness**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_indx` to store the indices of each element in the permutation.
   - It uses a `seen` array to track which elements have been considered during the binary search.
   - If `x` is not found at `p[left]` after the binary search, it tries to swap elements to ensure `x` is at the correct position.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not seen in the permutation by performing a single swap.
   - For more complex cases, it performs two swaps to ensure `x` is in the correct position.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
- The binary search logic is implemented correctly for a sorted array, but the permutation is not guaranteed to be sorted.
- The swapping logic is designed to correct the permutation so that the binary search can find `x` correctly. However, the logic for determining the indices to swap is not entirely clear and may not always produce the correct result, especially in edge cases where the permutation is highly unsorted.

### Conclusion:
- The program is mostly correct in its approach, but the swapping logic might not always ensure that `x` is found correctly after the binary search, especially in more complex permutations.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
