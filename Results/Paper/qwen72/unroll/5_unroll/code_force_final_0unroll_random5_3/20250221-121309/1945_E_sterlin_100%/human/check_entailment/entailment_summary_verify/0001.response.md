### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using a binary search algorithm after performing up to 2 swaps.
   - The binary search algorithm must be able to find `x` at the correct position `l` after the swaps.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm:**
   - The binary search algorithm is described as follows:
     - Initialize `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
     - Loop until `r - l = 1`.
     - Compute `m = (r + l) // 2`.
     - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`.
     - Otherwise, set `r = m`.
   - The goal is to have `p[l] = x` after the loop ends.

3. **Swapping Strategy:**
   - To make the binary search work correctly, we need to ensure that the element `x` is in a position where the binary search will find it.
   - The binary search will find `x` if `x` is in a position `i` such that `p[i] = x` and the elements to the left of `i` are less than or equal to `x`, and the elements to the right of `i` are greater than `x`.

4. **Implementation:**
   - The provided functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are used to read input.
   - However, the actual logic for solving the problem is missing. The functions only handle input reading and do not perform any swaps or binary search.
   - The program does not include any logic to determine the positions of `x` and the elements that need to be swapped.
   - The program does not include the binary search algorithm.
   - The program does not output the number of swaps or the indices of the swaps.

5. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_5` reads a line of user input and returns a list of strings split by whitespace. This function is used to read the permutation `p` as a list of integers.
   - The other functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) are used for reading different parts of the input, but they do not contribute to the solution logic.

6. **Validation of Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program is incomplete and does not solve the problem as described.
   - The program lacks the necessary logic to perform the required swaps and binary search.
   - The program does not output the number of swaps or the indices of the swaps, which are essential parts of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is indeed incomplete and does not solve the problem as described. It only includes functions for reading input but lacks the necessary logic to perform the required swaps and binary search.

### Correctness:
**False**
