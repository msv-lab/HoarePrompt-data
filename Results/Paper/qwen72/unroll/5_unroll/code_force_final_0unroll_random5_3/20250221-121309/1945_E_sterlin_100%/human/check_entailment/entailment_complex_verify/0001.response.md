### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - After the swaps, we need to ensure that the binary search algorithm will find `x` at the correct position.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm:**
   - The binary search algorithm is described as follows:
     - Initialize `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
     - Loop until `r - l = 1`.
     - Compute `m = (r + l) // 2`.
     - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`.
     - Otherwise, set `r = m`.
   - The goal is to have `p[l] = x` after the loop ends.

3. **Swapping Strategy:**
   - To make the binary search work correctly, we need to ensure that the element `x` is in a position where the binary search will find it.
   - The binary search will find `x` if `x` is in a position `i` such that `p[i] = x` and the elements to the left of `i` are less than or equal to `x`, and the elements to the right of `i` are greater than `x`.

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The provided functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are used to read input.
   - The main logic of the program is as follows:
     - Read the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case:
       - Read `n` and `x`.
       - Read the permutation `p`.
       - Create a dictionary `num_indx` to map each number in the permutation to its index.
       - Initialize `seen` as a list of zeros to keep track of which elements have been seen.
       - Perform a binary search on the permutation `p` to find the position `left` where `x` should be.
       - Check if `p[left] == x`. If true, no swaps are needed.
       - If `x` is not in the `seen` list, perform one swap to place `x` at the correct position.
       - If `x` is in the `seen` list, perform two swaps to place `x` at the correct position and another element to maintain the binary search property.

5. **Correctness of the Main Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is implemented correctly.
   - The swapping logic is designed to ensure that `x` is placed in a position where the binary search will find it.
   - The program correctly handles the cases where `x` is already in the correct position, where one swap is needed, and where two swaps are needed.

6. **Input Reading Functions:**
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read the input and are implemented correctly.
   - The functions `func_4` and `func_5` are not used in the main logic and are thus irrelevant to the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct. It reads the input, performs the necessary swaps to ensure the binary search will find `x`, and outputs the correct number of swaps and their indices.

### Final:
**True**
