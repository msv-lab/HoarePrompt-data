Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list of integers `a` from the input. It then determines if there are at least `k` values in `a` that are greater than the value at index `f-1` (the favorite value). If there are, it prints 'YES'. If the sum of the count of values greater than the favorite value and the count of values equal to the favorite value is less than or equal to `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
