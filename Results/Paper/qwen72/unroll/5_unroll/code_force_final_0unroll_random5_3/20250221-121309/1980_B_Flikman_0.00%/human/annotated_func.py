#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and lacks parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` as described in the problem. The parameters should satisfy the conditions: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `f` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ f, k ≤ n, and `a` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        same_value_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value == favorite_value:
                same_value_count += 1
        
        greater_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value > favorite_value:
                greater_count += 1
        
        if greater_count >= k:
            print('YES')
        elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are not directly modified by the loop. The loop reads new values for `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` in each iteration, and performs operations based on these values. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` will retain their last read values, but the specific values will depend on the input provided during the last iteration. The loop will have printed 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each iteration based on the conditions specified.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list of integers `a` from the input. It then determines if there are at least `k` values in `a` that are greater than the value at index `f-1` (the favorite value). If there are, it prints 'YES'. If the sum of the count of values greater than the favorite value and the count of values equal to the favorite value is less than or equal to `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
