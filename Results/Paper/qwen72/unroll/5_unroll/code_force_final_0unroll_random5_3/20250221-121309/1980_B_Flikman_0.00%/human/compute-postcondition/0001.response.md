The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, which means its value is not important for the loop to execute, but it will iterate from 0 to `t-1` if `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0**
