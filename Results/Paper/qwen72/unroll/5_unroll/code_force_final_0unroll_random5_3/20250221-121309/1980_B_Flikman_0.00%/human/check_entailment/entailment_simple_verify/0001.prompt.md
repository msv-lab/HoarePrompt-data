You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and lacks parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` as described in the problem. The parameters should satisfy the conditions: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `f` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ f, k ≤ n, and `a` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.

    #State: The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are not directly modified by the loop. The loop reads new values for `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` in each iteration, and performs operations based on these values. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` will retain their last read values, but the specific values will depend on the input provided during the last iteration. The loop will have printed 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each iteration based on the conditions specified.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the list of values `a` for the cubes.

2. **Favorite Cube Value:**
   - The program correctly identifies the value of the favorite cube using `a[f - 1]`.

3. **Counting Same and Greater Values:**
   - The program counts the number of cubes that have the same value as the favorite cube (`same_value_count`).
   - It also counts the number of cubes that have a value greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`).

4. **Determining the Outcome:**
   - If the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`) is greater than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will definitely be removed. This is because there are at least `k` cubes with higher values, and they will be removed first.
   - If the sum of the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube and the number of cubes with the same value (`greater_count + same_value_count`) is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will definitely not be removed. This is because there are not enough cubes with higher or equal values to reach `k` cubes to be removed.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the favorite cube may or may not be removed. This is because the favorite cube could be among the `k` cubes removed if it is one of the cubes with the same value, or it could be left if it is not among the first `k` cubes.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or may be removed based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
