Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input array has duplicate elements correctly. The problem description states that the beauty of the array is the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The function `func_1` calculates the beauty using the absolute difference, which is not what the problem description specifies. The beauty should be calculated as the sum of the differences without taking the absolute value.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
3 4 3 3
```
The correct output should be 1, as the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[3, 3, 3, 4]` or `[4, 3, 3, 3]`, resulting in a beauty of \((3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1\). However, the program will output 4, which is incorrect.
