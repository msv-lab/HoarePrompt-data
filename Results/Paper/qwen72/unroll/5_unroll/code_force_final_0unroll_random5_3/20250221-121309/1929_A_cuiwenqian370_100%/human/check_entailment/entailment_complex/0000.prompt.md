Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers with a length of at least 2.
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` with a length of at least 2. It sorts the list in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list. The function returns this sum, which represents the "beauty" of the array. The original list `array` is modified to be sorted.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to this function, but it reads input from stdin, expecting a formatted input as described in the problem statement.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, where `array` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data` for each iteration. `t` and `data` remain unchanged.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The `index` remains `1 + t * (1 + n)`, `results` is unchanged (it still contains the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, where `array` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data` for each iteration), and `t` and `data` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a formatted input from stdin, processes it to extract multiple arrays of integers, applies `func_1` to each array, and prints the results. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input data is processed and the results of `func_1` for each array are printed to stdout. The internal state of the function, including variables like `index` and `results`, is not relevant to the user.
