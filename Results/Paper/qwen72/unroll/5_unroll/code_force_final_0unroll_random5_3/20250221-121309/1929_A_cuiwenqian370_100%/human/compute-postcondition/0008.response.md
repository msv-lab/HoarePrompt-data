To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the `results` list, as it is the only object in the loop head that can influence whether the loop runs or not. The loop will execute if `results` is not empty. The other variables mentioned in the state, such as `index`, `t`, `data`, and `array`, are not directly part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `index` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, where `array` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data` for each iteration.
- `t` and `data` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `results` is not empty.

State: **`index` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`, `results` is a list containing at least one result of `func_1(array)`, where `array` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data` for each iteration, `t` and `data` remain unchanged.**
