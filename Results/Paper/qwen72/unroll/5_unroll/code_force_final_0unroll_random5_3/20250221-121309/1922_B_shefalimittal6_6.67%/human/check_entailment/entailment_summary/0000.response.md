Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from a given set of sticks, where the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2, such that a non-degenerate triangle can be formed. A non-degenerate triangle can be formed if and only if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `nums`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length.

3. **Triangle Formation Conditions**:
   - For a set of three sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\) to form a non-degenerate triangle, the following condition must hold:
     - \(2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}\)
     - \(2^{a_i} + 2^{a_k} > 2^{a_j}\)
     - \(2^{a_j} + 2^{a_k} > 2^{a_i}\)
   - Given that the lengths are powers of 2, the only way to satisfy these conditions is if at least two of the lengths are the same. This is because \(2^a + 2^a = 2^{a+1}\), and \(2^a + 2^b\) (where \(a \neq b\)) will always be less than \(2^{\max(a, b) + 1}\).

4. **Counting Valid Triplets**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of valid triplets:
     - If a stick length appears at least 3 times, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of that length using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
     - If a stick length appears at least 2 times, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of that length and one stick of a different length using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of the counts of all other stick lengths.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: \(7\) sticks with lengths \([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)
  - All sticks have the same length \(2^1 = 2\).
  - The number of ways to choose 3 sticks is \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\).
  - The program correctly outputs \(35\).

- **Test Case 2**: \(4\) sticks with lengths \([3, 2, 1, 3]\)
  - The stick lengths are \(2^3 = 8\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^1 = 2\), and \(2^3 = 8\).
  - Valid triplets are \((8, 8, 4)\) and \((8, 8, 2)\).
  - The number of ways to choose 2 sticks of length 8 and one stick of a different length is \(\binom{2}{2} \times 2 = 2\).
  - The program correctly outputs \(2\).

- **Test Case 3**: \(3\) sticks with lengths \([1, 2, 3]\)
  - The stick lengths are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), and \(2^3 = 8\).
  - No valid triplets can be formed because \(2 + 4 \leq 8\).
  - The program correctly outputs \(0\).

- **Test Case 4**: \(1\) stick with length \([1]\)
  - Only one stick, so no valid triplets can be formed.
  - The program correctly outputs \(0\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid triplets that can form a non-degenerate triangle, and it matches the expected output for the provided test cases.
