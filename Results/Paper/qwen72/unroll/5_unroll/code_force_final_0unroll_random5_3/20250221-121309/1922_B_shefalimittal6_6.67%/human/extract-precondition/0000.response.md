Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to reflect the correct parameters:

```
def count_triangle_ways(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and test_cases is a list of t lists, where each list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
