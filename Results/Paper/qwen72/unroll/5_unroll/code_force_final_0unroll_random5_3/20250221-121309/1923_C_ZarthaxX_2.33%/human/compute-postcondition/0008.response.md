The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer representing the length of the array `c`.
- `q`: an integer representing the number of queries.
- `c`: a list of positive integers.
- `queries`: a list of lists, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided test cases, the array `c`, and the queries. However, the specific return value is not explicitly described in the output section. Therefore, based on the given information, the functionality of the function `func_1` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries`. It processes multiple test cases, each with an array `c` of length `n` and a set of `q` queries. Each query is a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` indicating a range within the array `c`. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
