The function `func` reads from standard input (stdin) an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases, each containing the coordinates of four corners of a square. It calculates and prints the area of each square to standard output (stdout). The area is computed as the square of the side length, which is determined by the absolute difference in the y-coordinates of the given points, assuming the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
