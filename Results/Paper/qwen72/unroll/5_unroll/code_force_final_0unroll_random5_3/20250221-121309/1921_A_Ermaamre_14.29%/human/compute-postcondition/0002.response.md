Output State: **The loop will print the area of each square for each test case, calculated as the square of the side length. The side length is determined by the absolute difference in the y-coordinates of the given points, assuming the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, and `i` will be updated within the loop, but their final values after the loop ends are not relevant to the output state. The variable `a` will remain unchanged.**
