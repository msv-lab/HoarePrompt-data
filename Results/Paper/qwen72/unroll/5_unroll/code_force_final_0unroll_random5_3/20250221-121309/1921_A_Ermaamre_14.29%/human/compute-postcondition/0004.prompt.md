You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input (stdin) and output through standard output (stdout). The input includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each containing four lines with two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) per line, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It is guaranteed that the coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
            if y1 < y3:
                res = abs(y3 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y3)
        elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        
        print(res ** 2)
        
    #State: The loop will print the area of each square for each test case, calculated as the square of the side length. The side length is determined by the absolute difference in the y-coordinates of the given points, assuming the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, and `i` will be updated within the loop, but their final values after the loop ends are not relevant to the output state. The variable `a` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads from standard input (stdin) an integer t representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each containing four lines with two integers x_i, y_i per line, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It then processes each test case and prints to standard output (stdout) the area of the square for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
