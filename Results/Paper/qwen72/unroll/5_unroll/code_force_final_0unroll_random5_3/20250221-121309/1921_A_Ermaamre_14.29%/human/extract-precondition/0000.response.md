Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input (stdin) and output through standard output (stdout). The input includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each containing four lines with two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) per line, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It is guaranteed that the coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.**
