### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The function `func_1` processes the array `a` by iterating over each element.
   - If an element is greater than 10 and is not the first element, it splits the element into its tens and units digits (`y` and `x`).
   - It then checks if the tens digit `y` can be appended to the list `c` based on the conditions:
     - `y` must be greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (if `c` is not empty).
     - `y` must be less than or equal to `x`.
   - If both conditions are met, `y` and `x` are appended to `c` in that order.
   - If either condition is not met, the original element `a[i]` is appended to `c`.
   - If the element is the first element and is greater than 10, it is split and appended to `c` if the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit.
   - If the element is a single-digit number, it is directly appended to `c`.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After processing the array, the function checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to a sorted version of itself (`d`).
   - If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to the list `b`.
   - If `c` is not sorted, it appends `0` to the list `b`.

4. **Output:**
   - After all test cases are processed, the program iterates over the list `b` and prints 'YES' for each `1` and 'NO' for each `0`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
  - The logic for splitting the elements and appending them to `c` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if y >= c[n - 1]` is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted. The program should consider all possible ways to split the elements and check if any of these ways result in a sorted array.
  - For example, in the test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will not correctly split `28` into `2` and `8` and check if the resulting array can be sorted.

- **Incorrect Handling of Single-Digit Elements:**
  - The program does not handle single-digit elements correctly. It should always append single-digit elements to `c` without any conditions.

- **Incorrect Final Check:**
  - The final check `if (c == d)` is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted. The program should consider all possible ways to split the elements and check if any of these ways result in a sorted array.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the splitting and sorting logic, leading to incorrect results for some test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
