Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
NO
YES
```

The program fails on the first test case. The array `[12, 3, 45, 67]` can be transformed to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` by applying the operation to the elements `12` and `45`, which is a sorted array. However, the program incorrectly outputs `NO` for this case.

The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function, specifically in how it handles the splitting of numbers and the comparison with the previous elements in the array. The program does not correctly account for the possibility of splitting multiple elements and ensuring the resulting array is sorted.
