Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function Call Order**: The function `func_1()` is called twice in the loop, but the results are only stored once. This means the second call to `func_1()` is unnecessary and does not contribute to the solution.

2. **Logic for Splitting Elements**: The logic for splitting elements and checking if the resulting array can be sorted is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for appending the digits `x` and `y` to the array `c` are not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted. The program only checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order when they are inserted, but it does not consider the overall order of the array after all operations.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, it does not properly handle cases where the array is already sorted or where the array contains elements that are less than 10.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the following steps:

1. **Read the Input**: Read the number of test cases and the arrays for each test case.
2. **Check for Sorting**: For each array, check if it can be sorted by performing the operations. This involves:
   - Splitting any element that is at least 10 into its digits.
   - Ensuring that the resulting array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    # Function to split an element into its digits
    def split_element(x):
        if x < 10:
            return [x]
        return [x // 10, x % 10]

    # Split all elements that are at least 10
    new_a = []
    for num in a:
        new_a.extend(split_element(num))

    # Check if the new array is sorted
    return new_a == sorted(new_a)

m = int(input())
results = []

for _ in range(m):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **`can_be_sorted` Function**: This function takes an array `a` and checks if it can be sorted by splitting elements that are at least 10 into their digits and then checking if the resulting array is sorted.
2. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `m` and then processes each test case.
3. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the array `a`, calls the `can_be_sorted` function, and appends the result ('YES' or 'NO') to the `results` list.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This corrected program should handle all the cases correctly and produce the expected output.
