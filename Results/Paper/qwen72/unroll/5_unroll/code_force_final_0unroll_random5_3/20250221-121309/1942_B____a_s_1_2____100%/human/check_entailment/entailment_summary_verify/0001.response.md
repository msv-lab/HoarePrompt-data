### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires reconstructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Reconstructing the Permutation**:
   - The key insight is to use the relationship `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i` to determine each element of `p`.
   - The algorithm initializes `mex` to `n` and iterates from the last element to the first element of `a`.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: `mex` is set to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for MEX in the permutation.
   - **Iteration**: For each `i` from `n-1` to `0`:
     - `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`.
     - `mex` is updated to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` to ensure that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation up to index `i`.
   - **Output**: The permutation `p` is printed for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` by ensuring that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
   - By iterating in reverse order, the algorithm ensures that the MEX calculation is consistent with the definition and the given formula.
   - The update of `mex` to `min(mex, p[i])` ensures that the MEX is updated correctly as we move through the array.

5. **Verification**:
   - **Example 1**:
     - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
     - Calculation:
       - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
       - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
       - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
       - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
       - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
     - Output: `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`
     - Verification: `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`, `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`, `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`, `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1`, `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2`
   - **Example 2**:
     - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
     - Calculation:
       - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
       - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
       - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
       - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
       - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
     - Output: `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
     - Verification: `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`, `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`, `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 1`, `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3) - 3 = 1`, `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) - 4 = 1`
   - **Example 3**:
     - Input: `n = 3`, `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
     - Calculation:
       - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
       - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
       - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`
     - Output: `p = [2, 0, 1]`
     - Verification: `a_1 = MEX(2) - 2 = -2`, `a_2 = MEX(2, 0) - 0 = 1`, `a_3 = MEX(2, 0, 1) - 1 = 2`

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element**: If `n = 1`, the algorithm correctly sets `p[0]` to `1 - a[0]`.
   - **Constant Array**: If `a` is a constant array (e.g., all elements are 1), the algorithm correctly reconstructs the permutation as `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.

### Conclusion:
