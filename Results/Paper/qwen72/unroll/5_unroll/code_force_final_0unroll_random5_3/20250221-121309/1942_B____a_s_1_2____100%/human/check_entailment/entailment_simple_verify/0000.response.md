Reasoning: 

The original assessment claims that the program correctly constructs a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. Let's break down the program and the annotations to verify this claim.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `p` is initialized to a list of `-1` of length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates through the array `a` in reverse order, from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to the minimum of its current value and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The `mex` value is initially set to `n`, which is the length of the permutation.
   - As the program iterates in reverse, `mex` is updated to the minimum value of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.
   - This ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, the program prints the elements of `p`.

Let's verify the correctness using the example provided:

### Example 1:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
- Initial state: `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, `mex = 5`

#### Iteration:
- `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
- `i = 3`: `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
- `i = 2`: `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
- `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
- `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`

#### Final state:
- `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

### Verification:
- `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`
- `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`
- `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`
- `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1`
- `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2`

The constructed permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for all `i`.

### Example 2:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
- Initial state: `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, `mex = 5`

#### Iteration:
- `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
- `i = 3`: `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
- `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
- `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
- `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`

#### Final state:
- `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

### Verification:
- `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`
- `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`
- `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 1`
- `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3) - 3 = 1`
- `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) - 4 = 1`

The constructed permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for all `i`.

### Example 3:
- Input: `n = 3`, `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
- Initial state: `p = [-1, -1, -1]`, `mex = 3`

#### Iteration:
- `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
- `i = 1`: `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
- `i = 0`: `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`

#### Final state:
- `p = [2, 0, 1]`

### Verification:
- `a_1 = MEX(2) - 2 = -2`
- `a_2 = MEX(2, 0) - 0 = 1`
- `a_3 = MEX(2, 0, 1) - 1 = 2`

The constructed permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for all `i`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions for the array `a` in all provided examples. The logic and the approach used in the program are sound and align with the problem description.
