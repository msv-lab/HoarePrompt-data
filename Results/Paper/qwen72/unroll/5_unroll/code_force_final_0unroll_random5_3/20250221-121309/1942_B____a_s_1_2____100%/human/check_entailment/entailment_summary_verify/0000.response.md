### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program is correct, and it provides a detailed explanation of how the program works. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to verify this claim.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The permutation `p` is initialized as a list of `-1` of length `n`.
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the length of the permutation. This is a reasonable starting point because initially, all integers from `0` to `n-1` are potential candidates for the `mex`.

3. **Reverse Iteration:**
   - The function iterates over the list `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

4. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The `mex` value is updated to ensure that it always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation `p`.
   - By starting `mex` at `n` and updating it to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`, the program ensures that `mex` is always the smallest integer that has not been used in the permutation so far.

5. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `p` for each test case, the function prints the elements of `p`.

### Validation of the Original Assessment:

- **Correctness of the Formula:**
  - The formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]` is derived from the given condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
  - Rearranging this, we get `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.
  - Since `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation, `mex` is indeed the `MEX` of the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` at each step.

- **Update of `mex`:**
  - The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
  - This is crucial because it maintains the invariant that `mex` is the correct `MEX` value for the current prefix of `p`.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each one independently.

- **Example Verification:**
  - For the first test case with `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`:
    - `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`
    - `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`
    - `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`
    - `p[1] = 4 - 1 = 3` (but `mex` is already 2, so `p[1] = 1`)
    - `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`
    - The resulting permutation `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for all `i`.

  - For the second test case with `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`:
    - `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`
    - `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`
    - `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`
    - `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`
    - `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`
    - The resulting permutation `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for all `i`.

  - For the third test case with `a = [-2, 1, 2]`:
    - `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`
    - `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`
    - `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`
    - The resulting permutation `p = [2, 0, 1]` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for all `i`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given condition for each test case. The reasoning provided in the original assessment is accurate, and the program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
