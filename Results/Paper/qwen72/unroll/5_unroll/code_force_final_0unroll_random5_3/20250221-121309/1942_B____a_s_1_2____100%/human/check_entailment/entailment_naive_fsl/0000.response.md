Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly construct a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` for every potential case. It iterates through the array `a` in reverse order, calculating each element of `p` using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]` and updating the `mex` value accordingly. The `mex` value is initialized to `n`, which is the length of the permutation, and it is updated to the minimum of its current value and the newly calculated `p[i]` to ensure that the `mex` value is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation. This approach guarantees that the constructed permutation `p` will satisfy the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for all `i`. The program also handles the input and output as specified in the problem description, and it is designed to work for multiple test cases. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
