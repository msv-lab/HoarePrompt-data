You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates a permutation `p` of length `n` such that each element `p[i]` is determined by the formula `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` starts at `n` and is updated to the minimum value between `mex` and `p[i]` for each `i` in reverse order. After processing all test cases, the function prints the permutation `p` for each test case. The final state of the program is that `t` remains the same, `n` is the last input integer for the final test case, and `a` is the last list of integers input for the final test case. The list `p` will contain the calculated permutation for the final test case, and `mex` will be the minimum value in `p` for the final test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` is defined as `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The task is to reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a`.

2. **Reconstructing the Permutation**:
   - The key observation is that the MEX of the first `i` elements of `p` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i`.
   - Given `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, we can rearrange this to find `p_i`:
     \[
     p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i
     \]
   - To find `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i)`, we need to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation up to index `i`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize `mex` to `n` (the maximum possible value for MEX in the permutation).
   - Iterate from the last element to the first element of `a` (i.e., from `n-1` to `0`).
   - For each `i`, set `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`.
   - Update `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` to ensure that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation up to index `i`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The algorithm ensures that `p` is a valid permutation because it always assigns the smallest possible value that is not yet used in the permutation.
   - The values of `a` are calculated correctly based on the definition of MEX and the given formula.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly.
   - The algorithm also handles the case where `a` is a constant array (e.g., all elements are 1) correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given problem description and constraints. The logic and implementation are sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
