The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function internally uses or is provided with values for `t`, `n`, and `a` where:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers such that -n ≤ a_i ≤ n for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, representing the elements of the list.

The function returns a valid permutation `p` for the given data, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.

Functionality: **The function returns a valid permutation `p` for a given list `a` of integers, ensuring that the constraints on `t`, `n`, and `a` are satisfied.**
