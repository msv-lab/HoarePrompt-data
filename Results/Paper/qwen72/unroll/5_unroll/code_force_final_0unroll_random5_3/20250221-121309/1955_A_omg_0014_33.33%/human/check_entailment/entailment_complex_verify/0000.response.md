### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Variable Assignment**:
   - The original program assigns `(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())`, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the input should be `(n, a, b)`, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion.
   - This misassignment means that the program is using the wrong variables for the calculations, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Flawed Logic**:
   - The original program calculates `d = c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This logic is flawed because:
     - `c` is not the number of yogurts but the price of two yogurts on promotion.
     - `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is not the correct way to determine the cost of one yogurt from the promotion price.
     - The comparison `a * b < a * d` is incorrect because `b` is the number of yogurts, not the price of one yogurt, and `d` is not the correct price to compare against.
   - The correct logic should be to compare the cost of buying yogurts individually (`n * a`) with the cost of buying them in pairs using the promotion price (`(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`).

3. **Example of Incorrect Output**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     4
     2 5 9
     3 5 9
     3 5 11
     4 5 11
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     9
     14
     15
     20
     ```
   - However, the original program will produce:
     ```
     10
     15
     15
     20
     ```
   - This is because the program is using incorrect variables and logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues identified in the original program and the reasoning provided, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect and needs to be fixed.

Final: **False**
