The function `func` accepts no parameters directly in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function operates within a context where it processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` lines, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

- `t` is the number of test cases, and it is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is the number of nodes, an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
  - `m` is the number of edges, an integer such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2).
  - `k` is the number of queries, an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5.
  - Each of the `m` lines contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, a_i != b_i, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.

The function returns the results of processing these test cases, but the specific output format or type is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` lines containing integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. It returns the results of processing these test cases.**
