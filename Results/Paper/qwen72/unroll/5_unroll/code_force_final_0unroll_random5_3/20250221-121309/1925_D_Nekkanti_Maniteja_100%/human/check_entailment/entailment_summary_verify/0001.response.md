### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions.
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - The probability of picking a specific pair of friends in any given excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value of a specific pair of friends per excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected increase in the total sum of friendship values per excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum of initial friendship values}\).

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The sum of initial friendship values is calculated by summing up all `f_i` for the `m` pairs of friends.

3. **Expected Value Over `k` Excursions:**
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum of initial friendship values}\).
   - Over `k` excursions, the total expected increase is \(k \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum of initial friendship values}\).

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The result needs to be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - We need to compute the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) to handle the division in modular arithmetic.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It calculates the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.
   - It initializes `a` to store the sum of initial friendship values.
   - It reads the `m` pairs of friends and their initial friendship values, summing them up in `a`.
   - It initializes `s` to store the cumulative expected value.
   - The loop incorrectly updates `s` with `c * i * c * m + c * a`. This is incorrect because it should be updating `s` with the expected increase in the sum of friendship values, which is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum of initial friendship values}\) for each excursion.

6. **Corrected Program:**
   - The corrected program should calculate the expected increase in the sum of friendship values per excursion and then multiply it by `k` to get the total expected value.
   - The corrected loop should be:
     ```python
     expected_increase = c * a
     total_expected_value = k * expected_increase
     print(total_expected_value % M)
     ```

### Issues in the Original Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
  - The loop `for i in range(k): s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect.
  - The term `c * i * c * m` is unnecessary and incorrect.
  - The correct update should be `s = s + c * a` for each excursion.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        expected_increase = c * a
        total_expected_value = k * expected_increase
        print(total_expected_value % M)
```

### Final Answer:
- The original assessment correctly identified the issue in the program.
- The corrected program addresses the issue and correctly calculates the expected value.

Final: **False**
