### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which are the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions, respectively.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common modulus used in competitive programming to avoid large number overflow.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - It initializes `a` to 0, which will store the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
   - It reads `m` lines, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, and adds these values to `a`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Value:**
   - It initializes `s` to 0, which will store the sum of the expected friendship values over all excursions.
   - It iterates over `k` excursions and for each excursion, it updates `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship value.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is calculated as:
     - `c * i * c * m` which represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the pairs being chosen and their values increasing.
     - `c * a` which represents the expected value of the initial friendship values.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the value of `s` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
  - The modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) is correctly calculated using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`. This is necessary because we need to divide by the total number of pairs in the context of modular arithmetic.

- **Expected Value Calculation:**
  - The expected value calculation for each excursion is incorrect. The program should not multiply `i` by `c * m` and then add `c * a`. Instead, the expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship value for each friend pair chosen.
  - The correct expected value for each excursion should be `c * a + c * m * i`, where `c * a` is the expected value of the initial friendship values and `c * m * i` is the expected increase in friendship value due to the pairs being chosen and their values increasing.

- **Summation:**
  - The summation of the expected values over all excursions should be:
    \[
    s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (c \cdot a + c \cdot m \cdot i)
    \]
  - This can be simplified to:
    \[
    s = k \cdot (c \cdot a) + c \cdot m \cdot \frac{(k-1) \cdot k}{2}
    \]

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        # Correct expected value calculation
        s = (k * (c * a) + c * m * (k * (k - 1) // 2)) % M
        
        print(s)
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical error in the expected value calculation. The corrected program correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all excursions.

### Correctness:
**False**
