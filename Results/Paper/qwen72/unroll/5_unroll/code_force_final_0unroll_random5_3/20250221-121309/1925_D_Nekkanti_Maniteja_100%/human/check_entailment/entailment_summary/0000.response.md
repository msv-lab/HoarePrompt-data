Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, where the friendship value of a chosen pair of friends increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion. The solution must handle multiple test cases and print the result for each case modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Let's break down the program and the problem:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Modulo and Inverse Calculation:**
   - The program defines `M` as \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct because \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`, and `c` is used to normalize the probability of choosing a specific pair.

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program initializes `a` to 0 and sums up the initial friendship values `f_i` for all pairs of friends.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `s` to 0.
   - It iterates `k` times, and in each iteration, it updates `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` represents the expected increase in the sum of friendship values due to the chosen pairs being friends and their values increasing by 1 in each subsequent excursion.
   - The term `c * a` represents the expected value of the initial friendship values.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints `s % M` for each test case.

However, there is a logical error in the expected value calculation. The term `c * i * c * m` is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values. The correct term should be `c * m * (i + 1)` to account for the cumulative increase in friendship values.

Let's correct the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * m * (i + 1) + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

With this correction, the program should correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each test case.

Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect term in the expected value calculation)
