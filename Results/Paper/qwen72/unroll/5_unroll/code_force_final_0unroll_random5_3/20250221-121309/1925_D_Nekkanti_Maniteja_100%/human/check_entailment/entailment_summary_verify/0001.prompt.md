You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` lines containing integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` based on the inputs and prints `s` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are unchanged after each test case, and the internal variables `M`, `c`, and `a` are reset for each new test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` children, `m` pairs of friends, and `k` excursions.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
   - For each excursion, the teacher randomly picks a pair of children.
   - If the picked pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - The probability of picking a specific pair of friends in any given excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value of a specific pair of friends per excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected increase in the total sum of friendship values per excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum of initial friendship values}\).

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The sum of initial friendship values is calculated by summing up all `f_i` for the `m` pairs of friends.

4. **Expected Value Over `k` Excursions:**
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum of initial friendship values}\).
   - Over `k` excursions, the total expected increase is \(k \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum of initial friendship values}\).

5. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The result needs to be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - We need to compute the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) to handle the division in modular arithmetic.

6. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It calculates the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.
   - It initializes `a` to store the sum of initial friendship values.
   - It reads the `m` pairs of friends and their initial friendship values, summing them up in `a`.
   - It initializes `s` to store the cumulative expected value.
   - It iterates over `k` excursions, updating `s` with the expected increase in friendship values.
   - Finally, it prints `s % M`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
  - The program incorrectly updates `s` in the loop. The expected increase in the sum of friendship values per excursion should be \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum of initial friendship values}\).
  - The loop should not multiply `i` by `c` and then `m` by `c` again. This is incorrect and will lead to an incorrect result.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        expected_increase = c * a
        total_expected_value = k * expected_increase
        print(total_expected_value % M)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the way it calculates the expected value over `k` excursions.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the expected increase per excursion and then multiplies it by `k`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
