Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns a single integer that is the result of applying the function `func_1` sequentially to all elements in the list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the returned value is the cumulative result of `func_1` applied to each element in the `numbers` list, starting from the first element. **
