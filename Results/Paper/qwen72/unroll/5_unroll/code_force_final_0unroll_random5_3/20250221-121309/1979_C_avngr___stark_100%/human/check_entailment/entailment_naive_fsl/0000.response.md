Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, but the problem requires a solution to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3
3 2 7
```

The expected output should be a list of integers `x_1, x_2, x_3` such that the total sum of `x_1 + x_2 + x_3` is strictly less than `3 * x_1`, `2 * x_2`, and `7 * x_3`. However, the provided program does not produce any output related to this problem. Instead, it computes the LCM of the multipliers, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
