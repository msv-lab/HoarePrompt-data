Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins in a way that ensures a profit for any winning outcome. The core logic involves calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers (`k_i`) for all outcomes and then distributing the coins such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Analysis of Functions:
1. **`func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b` using the formula `LCM(a, b) = abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function is correct and does what it is supposed to do.

2. **`func_2(numbers)`**:
   - This function calculates the LCM of a list of integers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the elements of the list.
   - The function is correct and returns the LCM of the list of integers.

### Main Logic:
- The main logic of the program involves:
  - Reading the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case:
    - Reading the number of outcomes `n`.
    - Reading the list of multipliers `k`.
    - Calculating the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2(k)`.
    - Distributing the coins such that the bet on the i-th outcome is `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM.
    - Checking if the total bet is less than `m`. If it is, the distribution is valid; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Verification of the Main Logic:
- **Correct Distribution**:
  - The program calculates the LCM of the multipliers, which ensures that the total bet is a common multiple of all the multipliers.
  - The bet on the i-th outcome is `m // k[i]`, which means the return for the i-th outcome is `k[i] * (m // k[i]) = m`.
  - The total bet is `sum(c)`, where `c[i] = m // k[i]` for all `i`.
  - The condition for a valid distribution is `sum(c) < m`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If all multipliers are the same, the LCM will be that multiplier, and the total bet will be `n * (m // k[0])`. For this to be less than `m`, `n` must be less than `k[0]`. If `n >= k[0]`, the program correctly outputs `-1`.
  - If the multipliers are different, the LCM will be larger, and the program will check if the total bet is less than the LCM.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `3 3 2 7`
  - LCM: `42`
  - Bets: `42 // 3 = 14`, `42 // 2 = 21`, `42 // 7 = 6`
  - Total bet: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
  - Since `41 < 42`, the distribution is valid.
  - Output: `14 21 6`

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `2 3 3`
  - LCM: `3`
  - Bets: `3 // 3 = 1`, `3 // 3 = 1`
  - Total bet: `1 + 1 = 2`
  - Since `2 < 3`, the distribution is valid.
  - Output: `1 1`

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `5 5 5 5 5 5`
  - LCM: `5`
  - Bets: `5 // 5 = 1` for all outcomes
  - Total bet: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`
  - Since `5 >= 5`, the distribution is invalid.
  - Output: `-1`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of coins for each test case, and it handles edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
