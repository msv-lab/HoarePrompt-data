The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `numbers`. For the loop to execute, `numbers[1:]` must contain at least one element. This means that `numbers` must have at least two elements. The state of `num` will be the second element of `numbers` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `result` is equal to the first element of `numbers`, `num` is the second element of `numbers`**
