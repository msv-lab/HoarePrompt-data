### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute a certain number of coins on `n` outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The return for the i-th outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by `k_i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - Let `x_i` be the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The return for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`.
   - We need `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

3. **Simplifying the Condition:**
   - For each `i`, the condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i
     \]

4. **Finding a Solution:**
   - To satisfy the above condition for all `i`, we need to find `x_i` such that the sum of all other bets is less than the return from the i-th bet.
   - One approach is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i - 1` to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that satisfies the condition for all outcomes.

5. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` calculates the LCM of two numbers.
   - The function `func_2(numbers)` calculates the LCM of a list of numbers.
   - We can use `func_2` to find the LCM of all `k_i - 1`.

6. **Distributing the Bets:**
   - Once we have the LCM, we can set `x_i` to be the LCM divided by `k_i - 1`.
   - This ensures that the sum of all other bets is less than the return from the i-th bet.

7. **Checking for No Solution:**
   - If the LCM of all `k_i - 1` is greater than `10^9`, then we cannot find a valid solution because the bets would exceed the allowed range.

8. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` for LCM of two numbers and `func_2` for LCM of a list of numbers.
   - The program does not directly implement the solution for the problem, but it provides the necessary tools to calculate the LCM.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions are correct for calculating the LCM, which is a crucial part of the solution. However, the program does not include the logic to distribute the bets or handle the test cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not solve the problem as required.

Correctness: **False**
