Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem correctly. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. The problem requires determining a way to distribute coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, and the provided functions do not perform this task.

To solve the problem, you would need to:
1. Determine if a valid distribution of coins is possible.
2. If possible, output a distribution that meets the criteria.

A correct approach would involve:
- For each test case, calculate the total sum of the bets.
- Ensure that for each outcome, the bet on that outcome multiplied by its multiplier is greater than the total sum of all bets.
- If such a distribution is not possible, output `-1`.

Here is a more appropriate solution:

```python
def solve(test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n = case[0]
        k = case[1]
        total_sum = sum(k)
        possible = True
        bets = []
        for ki in k:
            if (total_sum - 1) // ki >= 1:
                possible = False
                break
            bets.append(1)
        
        if possible:
            results.append(bets)
        else:
            results.append([-1])
    
    return results

# Reading input
t = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, k))

# Solving and printing output
results = solve(test_cases)
for result in results:
    if result[0] == -1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(" ".join(map(str, result)))
```

This solution checks if a valid distribution of coins is possible and outputs the bets accordingly. If the total sum of the bets minus one is greater than or equal to the product of any bet and its multiplier, it is impossible to win, and the function outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs a distribution where each bet is 1 coin, which is a valid solution if it exists.
