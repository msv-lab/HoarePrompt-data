The function `func_1` accepts a balanced parentheses sequence `s` and returns a string `ans` containing the characters from `s` rearranged by their depth in ascending order and by their original positions in descending order. The input `s` is a non-empty string of balanced parentheses with a length not exceeding 500,000. After the function concludes, the dictionary `d` is no longer in its original state and has been modified to store the depth of parentheses at each position, and `ans` contains the rearranged string.
