Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program calculates the number of fireworks visible at any time by simply adding the number of times each installation can launch fireworks within the visibility period `m` and then adding 2. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap in visibility times between the fireworks launched by the two installations.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

1. **Visibility Period of Each Firework:** Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
2. **Launch Times:** The first installation launches fireworks at times `a, 2a, 3a, ...` and the second installation at times `b, 2b, 3b, ...`.
3. **Overlap Calculation:** We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen at the same time. This involves finding the maximum overlap of the visibility periods of the fireworks launched by both installations.

The correct approach involves calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodic overlap of the launch times. Then, we need to check the visibility periods to find the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def max_fireworks(a, b, m):
    # Calculate the least common multiple of a and b
    l = lcm(a, b)
    
    # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period
    count_a = (m + a) // a
    count_b = (m + b) // b
    
    # Calculate the number of overlapping fireworks
    count_overlap = (m + l) // l
    
    # The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the sum of the counts minus the overlap
    max_visible = count_a + count_b - count_overlap
    
    return max_visible

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(max_fireworks(a, b, m))

func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously by considering the overlap in their visibility periods.
