The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, including `t` (the number of test cases) and for each test case, parameters `a`, `b`, and `m`. 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18.

The function returns different values based on the input parameters:
- For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Since the specific output is not provided, we can only describe the general functionality based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `a`, `b`, and `m` within the specified range. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
