Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. `A` is `int(m/a) + 1` and `B` is `int(m/b) + 1`. The sum `A + B` is printed for each test case.**

Explanation:
- `t` is read from input and remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are read from input and remain integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18.
- `A` is calculated as `int(m/a) + 1`, and `B` is calculated as `int(m/b) + 1`.
- The sum of `A` and `B` is printed for each test case.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are reset for each test case, and the values of `A` and `B` are recalculated accordingly.
