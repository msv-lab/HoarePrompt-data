### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case.
   - It initializes the necessary variables and lists for storing the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha.

2. **Max Value Check**:
   - The program first checks if both Bodya and Sasha start at positions with the maximum value in the array `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya starts at the maximum value position, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only Sasha starts at the maximum value position, it prints "Sasha" and continues.
   - This is a valid optimization because if a player starts at the maximum value position, they can always stay there and accumulate the maximum score, thus winning or drawing the game.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It uses two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha at each turn.
   - It also uses two boolean flags `founds` and `foundb` to track if a player has reached a position with the maximum value in `a`.

4. **Optimization for Maximum Value**:
   - If a player reaches a position with the maximum value in `a`, the program sets the corresponding flag and appends the maximum value to the score list for the remaining turns.
   - This is a valid optimization because once a player reaches the maximum value position, they can stay there and accumulate the maximum score for the remaining turns.

5. **Prefix Sums**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for the scores of Bodya and Sasha using the lists `preb` and `pres`.
   - This is necessary to keep track of the cumulative scores at each turn.

6. **Final Scores Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the final scores for Bodya and Sasha by considering the remaining turns and the maximum value they can accumulate.
   - It uses the lists `ptsb` and `ptss` to store these final scores.
   - However, there is a potential issue in the final scores calculation. The program assumes that once a player reaches the maximum value position, they will stay there for the remaining turns. This assumption is not always correct. For example, if a player reaches the maximum value position but the permutation `p` moves them to a different position, they might not stay at the maximum value position for the remaining turns.

7. **Determine the Winner**:
   - The program finds the maximum score for Bodya and Sasha from the lists `ptsb` and `ptss`.
   - It then compares these maximum scores to determine the winner.
   - If Sasha's maximum score is greater, it prints "Sasha".
   - If Bodya's maximum score is greater, it prints "Bodya".
   - If both scores are equal, it prints "Draw".

### Issues Identified:
- **Final Scores Calculation**:
  - The program incorrectly assumes that once a player reaches the maximum value position, they will stay there for the remaining turns. This is not always true because the permutation `p` might move them to a different position.
  - For example, consider a permutation `p` where `p[x]` is not `x` for the maximum value position `x`. The player will move to `p[x]` and might not stay at the maximum value position.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for handling the maximum value positions and the final scores calculation is flawed. Specifically, the assumption that a player will stay at the maximum value position for the remaining turns is incorrect. This can lead to incorrect results in some test cases.

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
