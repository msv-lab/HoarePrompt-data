Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation. Instead, the program assumes that players will always move to the next position in the permutation if they do not find the maximum score at their current position, which is not aligned with the game rules.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output "Draw" because it incorrectly assumes that both players will move to the position with the maximum score in the array `a` if they do not already have the maximum score at their starting position.

However, according to the game rules, Bodya can stay at position 3 and accumulate a score of 5 + 5 = 10, while Sasha can move to position 1 and then stay there, accumulating a score of 2 + 7 = 9. Therefore, Bodya wins, but the program does not correctly handle this scenario.
