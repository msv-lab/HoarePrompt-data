Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the game logic as specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the program makes an incorrect assumption that once a player finds the maximum score in the array `a`, they will always move to that position or stay there, which is not aligned with the game rules. According to the rules, players can choose to either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation `p` on each turn. This choice is not reflected in the program's logic.

Let's break down the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Moves:**
   - The program uses the variables `foundb` and `founds` to track whether Bodya or Sasha has found the maximum score in the array `a`. Once a player finds the maximum score, the program assumes they will always stay at that position or move to a position with the maximum score.
   - This is incorrect because the players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation `p` on each turn, regardless of whether they have the maximum score.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The program calculates the scores for each player by appending the maximum score `maxa` to the score lists `b` and `s` once the players have found the maximum score. This does not accurately reflect the game rules, where the score is incremented by the value at the current position, and the player can choose to stay or move.
   - The program also incorrectly calculates the potential scores for the remaining turns by multiplying the remaining turns by the maximum score `maxa` and adding it to the current score. This is not how the game should be played, as the players' scores should be based on the actual values in the array `a` at their positions, not just the maximum score.

3. **Example Case:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     4 2 3 2
     4 1 2 3
     7 2 5 6
     ```
   - The expected output is "Bodya", but the program will output "Draw" because it incorrectly assumes that both players will move to the position with the maximum score in the array `a` if they do not already have the maximum score at their starting position.
   - According to the game rules, Bodya can stay at position 3 and accumulate a score of 5 + 5 = 10, while Sasha can move to position 1 and then stay there, accumulating a score of 2 + 7 = 9. Therefore, Bodya wins, but the program does not correctly handle this scenario.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and will produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Final: **False**
