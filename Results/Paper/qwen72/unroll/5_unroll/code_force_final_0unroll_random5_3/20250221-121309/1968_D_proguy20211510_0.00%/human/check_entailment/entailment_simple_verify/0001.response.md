### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case.
   - It initializes the necessary variables and lists for storing the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha.

2. **Max Value Check**:
   - The program first checks if both Bodya and Sasha start at positions with the maximum value in the array `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya starts at the maximum value position, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only Sasha starts at the maximum value position, it prints "Sasha" and continues.
   - This is a valid optimization because if a player starts at the maximum value position, they can always stay there and accumulate the maximum score, thus winning or drawing the game.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It uses two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha at each turn.
   - It also uses two boolean flags `founds` and `foundb` to track if a player has reached a position with the maximum value in `a`.

4. **Optimization for Maximum Value**:
   - If a player reaches a position with the maximum value in `a`, the program sets the corresponding flag and appends the maximum value to the score list for the remaining turns.
   - This is a valid optimization because once a player reaches the maximum value position, they can stay there and accumulate the maximum score for the remaining turns.

5. **Prefix Sums**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for the scores of Bodya and Sasha using the lists `preb` and `pres`.
   - This is necessary to keep track of the cumulative scores at each turn.

6. **Final Scores Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the final scores for Bodya and Sasha by considering the remaining turns and the maximum value they can accumulate.
   - It uses the lists `ptsb` and `ptss` to store these final scores.
   - However, there is a subtle issue in the final scores calculation. The program assumes that the maximum score for the remaining turns is simply the maximum value in `a` multiplied by the remaining turns. This is not always correct because the players might not stay at the maximum value position for all remaining turns. They might move to other positions that do not have the maximum value.

7. **Determine the Winner**:
   - The program finds the maximum score for Bodya and Sasha from the lists `ptsb` and `ptss`.
   - It then compares these maximum scores to determine the winner.
   - If Sasha's maximum score is greater, it prints "Sasha".
   - If Bodya's maximum score is greater, it prints "Bodya".
   - If both scores are equal, it prints "Draw".

### Issues Found:
- **Final Scores Calculation**:
  - The program incorrectly assumes that once a player reaches a position with the maximum value, they will stay there for all remaining turns. This is not always the case, as the permutation might cause them to move to other positions.
  - The correct approach should be to simulate the game for the full `k` turns, considering the permutation and the array `a` at each step, without making assumptions about staying at the maximum value position.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed assumption in the final scores calculation. The optimization for the maximum value positions is not sufficient to handle all cases, especially when the permutation causes the players to move to other positions.

Final: **False**
