You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: The loop will have processed all the test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the conditions described in the loop.

The loop control variable `_` will have the value of the number of iterations completed, which is equal to the number of test cases `t`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case.
   - It initializes the necessary variables and lists for storing the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha.

2. **Max Value Check**:
   - The program first checks if both Bodya and Sasha start at positions with the maximum value in the array `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya starts at the maximum value position, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only Sasha starts at the maximum value position, it prints "Sasha" and continues.
   - This is a valid optimization because if a player starts at the maximum value position, they can always stay there and accumulate the maximum score, thus winning or drawing the game.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It uses two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha at each turn.
   - It also uses two boolean flags `founds` and `foundb` to track if a player has reached a position with the maximum value in `a`.

4. **Optimization for Maximum Value**:
   - If a player reaches a position with the maximum value in `a`, the program sets the corresponding flag and appends the maximum value to the score list for the remaining turns.
   - This is a valid optimization because once a player reaches the maximum value position, they can stay there and accumulate the maximum score for the remaining turns.

5. **Prefix Sums**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for the scores of Bodya and Sasha using the lists `preb` and `pres`.
   - This is necessary to keep track of the cumulative scores at each turn.

6. **Final Scores Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the final scores for Bodya and Sasha by considering the remaining turns and the maximum value they can accumulate.
   - It uses the lists `ptsb` and `ptss` to store these final scores.

7. **Determine the Winner**:
   - The program finds the maximum score for Bodya and Sasha from the lists `ptsb` and `ptss`.
   - It then compares these maximum scores to determine the winner.
   - If Sasha's maximum score is greater, it prints "Sasha".
   - If Bodya's maximum score is greater, it prints "Bodya".
   - If both scores are equal, it prints "Draw".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the game simulation and the optimization for the maximum value positions. It also correctly calculates the final scores and determines the winner based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
