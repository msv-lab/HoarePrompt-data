Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case correctly when the hour is `12` and the time should be in the PM format. According to the problem description, `12:00` in 24-hour format should be `12:00 PM` in 12-hour format, but the program incorrectly assigns `12:00 AM` for `12:00` and `12:00 PM` for `00:00`. This is a clear violation of the problem description, making the program incorrect.
