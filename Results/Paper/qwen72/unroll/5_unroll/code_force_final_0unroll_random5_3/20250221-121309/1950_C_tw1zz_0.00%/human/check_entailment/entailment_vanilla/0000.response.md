### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes).

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hour `h` to the 12-hour format hour `h1` and determine whether it is `AM` or `PM`.
   - The conditions cover all possible hour values from `00` to `23` and correctly map them to the 12-hour format.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program constructs the 12-hour format time string by concatenating `h1`, `:`, `m`, and `time` (either `AM` or `PM`).
   - The `print` function is used to output the formatted time string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases:
     - `00:00` is converted to `12:00 AM`.
     - `12:00` is converted to `12:00 PM`.
     - `23:59` is converted to `11:59 PM`.

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The program follows the problem description and handles all valid inputs as specified.
   - The logic for converting hours and determining `AM` or `PM` is correct and comprehensive.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
