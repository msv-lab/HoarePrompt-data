You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    adhoccoder

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        match_c = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        if match_a_b and (not match_c):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It then checks if the string `c` matches a template derived from `a` and `b` according to specific rules: the template is constructed by copying characters from `a` and `b` where they match, and using uppercase characters where they differ. The function prints 'YES' if `c` matches the template and `a` and `b` do not conflict with the template, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - The program constructs a template `t` by iterating through each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it adds that character to the template as a lowercase letter.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different, it adds the character from `a` to the template as an uppercase letter.

3. **Matching Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `a` and `b` match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - The program checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it ensures that `c[i]` is different from the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that `c[i]` is the same as the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Output:**
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues:
- **Template Construction:**
  - The template construction logic is flawed. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the program adds `a[i].upper()` to the template. This is incorrect because the template should allow both `a[i]` and `b[i]` to match, but `a[i].upper()` only allows `a[i]` to match, not `b[i]`.
  - A correct approach would be to use a character that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` when they are different. For example, if `a[i]` is 'a' and `b[i]` is 'b', the template could use 'C' (or any other uppercase letter that is not 'A' or 'B').

- **Matching Conditions:**
  - The matching conditions for `a` and `b` are correct.
  - The matching condition for `c` is incorrect. The program should ensure that `c[i]` is different from the lowercase version of the template character if the template character is uppercase, and the same if the template character is lowercase.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                # Choose an uppercase letter that is different from both a[i] and b[i]
                for ch in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
                    if ch.lower() != a[i] and ch.lower() != b[i]:
                        template.append(ch)
                        break
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i] == template[i].lower() or b[i] == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        match_c = False
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] == template[i]:
                    match_c = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == template[i].lower():
                match_c = True
                break
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** due to the flawed template construction and matching conditions for `c`.
- The corrected program should be **correct** as it properly constructs the template and checks the matching conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
