Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it correctly implements the problem's requirements:

1. **Incorrect Movement Function**: The `func_1` function is supposed to handle the movement of entities. However, the movement directions are incorrectly defined. The movements should be:
   - 'L' (left): (-1, 0)
   - 'R' (right): (1, 0)
   - 'U' (up): (0, -1)
   - 'D' (down): (0, 1)
   The current definitions are incorrect for 'L' and 'R' (they should be swapped).

2. **Handling the Quaffle**: The program does not handle the Quaffle correctly. It does not keep track of which player is carrying the Quaffle or where the Quaffle is when it is not being carried. This is crucial for determining when a player can catch or throw the Quaffle.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is incomplete. The program should check if a player is carrying the Quaffle before scoring. Additionally, it should handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which should award a point to the opposing team.

4. **Resetting the Quaffle**: After a goal is scored, the Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field. The program does not include this step.

5. **Catching the Quaffle**: The program does not handle the catching of the Quaffle. It should update the state to indicate which player is carrying the Quaffle.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
