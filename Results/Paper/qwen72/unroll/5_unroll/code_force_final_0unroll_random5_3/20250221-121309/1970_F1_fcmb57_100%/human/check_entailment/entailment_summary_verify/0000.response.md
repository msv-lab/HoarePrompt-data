Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a logical error in the scoring mechanism. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem description, if a player scores in their own goal, the opposing team should receive the point. However, the current implementation does not account for this and will incorrectly increment the score of the team that scored in their own goal.

Let's break down the specific issues:

1. **Scoring Mechanism**:
   - The program checks if the player's position is in the list of goals for the scoring team (`if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']` and `if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']`).
   - This check does not differentiate between scoring in the correct goal and scoring in the wrong goal (own goal).

2. **Correct Handling of Own Goals**:
   - If a red player scores in a red goal, the blue team should get a point.
   - If a blue player scores in a blue goal, the red team should get a point.
   - The program should check the team of the player and the type of goal they are in to determine the correct scoring team.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to update the player's position based on the movement direction. It correctly unpacks the coordinates and applies the movement, but it does not handle boundary conditions (though the problem guarantees valid inputs, so this is not a critical issue here).

Given the above points, the program's scoring logic is indeed flawed, and the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
