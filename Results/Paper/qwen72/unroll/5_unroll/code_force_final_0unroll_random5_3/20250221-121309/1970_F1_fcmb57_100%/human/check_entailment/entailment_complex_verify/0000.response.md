Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The program indeed has a logical error in the scoring mechanism. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem description, if a player scores in their own goal, the opposing team should get the point. However, the current implementation does not account for this and will incorrectly increment the score of the player's own team.

Let's break down the relevant part of the code:

```python
if mo[1] == 'T':
    if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
        pointsb += 1
        print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
    if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
        pointsr += 1
        print(i, 'RED GOAL')
```

This code checks if the player's position is in the list of goals for the scoring team. However, it does not check which team the player belongs to. Therefore, if a red player scores in a red goal, the program will incorrectly increment the red team's score. Similarly, if a blue player scores in a blue goal, the program will incorrectly increment the blue team's score.

To fix this, the program should check the team of the player before deciding which team gets the point. For example:

```python
if mo[1] == 'T':
    player_team = mo[0][0]  # Get the team of the player (R or B)
    if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
        if player_team == 'R':
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
        else:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
    if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
        if player_team == 'B':
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
        else:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
```

This corrected version ensures that if a player scores in their own goal, the opposing team gets the point.

Given the logical error identified in the original assessment, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
