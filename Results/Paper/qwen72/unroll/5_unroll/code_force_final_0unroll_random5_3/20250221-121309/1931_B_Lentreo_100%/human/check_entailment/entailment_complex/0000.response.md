### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given `n` containers with initial amounts of water `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of the amounts of water is divisible by `n`.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If the sum of the amounts of water is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container after balancing will be `mean = total / n`.
   - The operation `pour any amount of water from the i-th container to the j-th container where i < j` means we can only move water from left to right.
   - To achieve the target amount in each container, the cumulative difference from the mean should never be negative. If it becomes negative at any point, it means we cannot balance the containers using the given operation.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the mean of the list `nums`.
   - It then iterates through the list and keeps a running total `curr` of the difference between each element and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns 'NO' because it indicates that we cannot balance the containers without violating the `i < j` constraint.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the sum of `nums` is not divisible by `n` by returning 'NO' immediately.
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are already equal to the mean.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the list can be balanced by pouring water from left to right.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the test case `[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`:
     - Mean = `(4 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3) // 5 = 3`
     - Iteration:
       - `4 - 3 = 1` (curr = 1)
       - `5 - 3 = 2` (curr = 3)
       - `2 - 3 = -1` (curr = 2)
       - `1 - 3 = -2` (curr = 0)
       - `3 - 3 = 0` (curr = 0)
     - The program returns 'YES' which is correct.
   - For the test case `[1, 2, 3]`:
     - Mean = `(1 + 2 + 3) // 3 = 2`
     - Iteration:
       - `1 - 2 = -1` (curr = -1)
     - The program returns 'NO' which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the containers can be balanced using the given operation. It handles all edge cases and the provided examples correctly.

Correctness: **True**
