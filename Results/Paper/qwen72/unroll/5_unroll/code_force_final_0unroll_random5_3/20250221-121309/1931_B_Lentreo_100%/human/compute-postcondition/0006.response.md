Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `total % n` is equal to 0, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, `curr` is 0.** 

The variable `curr` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`nums`, `n`, `total`, and `mean`) remain unchanged and retain their initial properties and values.
