### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Sum and Mean Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total amount of water in all containers using `sum(nums)`.
   - It then checks if the total amount is divisible by `n` using `total % n != 0`. However, this check is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. The function `func_1` should not perform this check, but it does not affect the correctness of the program in this context since the input is guaranteed to be valid.

3. **Mean Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have after the operations using `mean = total // n`.

4. **Feasibility Check:**
   - The program initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the mean.
   - It iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that it is not possible to balance the water amounts using the given operations (pouring from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index). This is because a negative `curr` indicates that more water has been poured out than can be poured back in to balance the containers.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it means that it is possible to balance the water amounts, and the program returns 'YES'.

5. **Function Summary Validation:**
   - The function summary states that `func_1` checks if the list can be balanced such that the cumulative difference from the mean of the list never becomes negative. This is accurate and aligns with the logic implemented in the function.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n` (as guaranteed by the problem statement) and checks the feasibility of balancing the water amounts.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct. It correctly checks the feasibility of balancing the water amounts in the containers based on the given operations and constraints. The unnecessary check for divisibility by `n` does not affect the correctness of the program given the problem constraints.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
