Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the operation of pouring water from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index. The key insight is that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, which means there exists a target amount of water (the mean) that each container should have for the containers to be balanced.

The provided program checks if the cumulative difference from this mean value ever becomes negative as it iterates through the list of water amounts. If it does, it returns 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to balance the containers with the given operation because at some point, a container would need to receive water from a container with a higher index, which is not allowed.

However, the program does not need to check if the cumulative difference becomes negative. Instead, it should check if the sum of the water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers and if the maximum water in any container is not more than the mean value plus the total excess water (the sum of the differences between each container's water and the mean). This is because, if the maximum water in any container exceeds this threshold, it would be impossible to pour water from this container to others without violating the condition that the cumulative difference must not become negative.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the operation, the program's logic of checking if the cumulative difference ever becomes negative is actually sufficient and correct. If the cumulative difference never becomes negative, it means that we can always pour water from a container with more water to a container with less water without violating the operation rules, and thus, the containers can be balanced.

Therefore, the program is correct in its approach and should work for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
