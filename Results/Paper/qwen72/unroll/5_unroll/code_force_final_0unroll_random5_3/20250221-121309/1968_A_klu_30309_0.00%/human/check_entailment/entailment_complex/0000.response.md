### Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to find an integer `y` (1 â‰¤ y < x) that maximizes the value of `gcd(x, y) + y`. The function iterates over possible values of `y` in descending order from `x-1` to `2` and checks if `y` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). If `y` is a divisor and `2 * y >= x`, the function immediately returns `y`. If no such `y` is found, the function returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1. If no divisors are found, the function returns `1`.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Iterating in Descending Order**:
   - The function iterates from `x-1` down to `2`. This ensures that the first `y` found that satisfies the conditions will be the largest possible `y`.

2. **Checking Divisibility**:
   - The condition `x % y == 0` checks if `y` is a divisor of `x`. If `y` is a divisor, then `gcd(x, y) = y`.

3. **Maximizing `gcd(x, y) + y`**:
   - If `y` is a divisor and `2 * y >= x`, the function returns `y`. This condition ensures that `y` is at least half of `x`, which is a good candidate for maximizing `gcd(x, y) + y` because `gcd(x, y) = y` and `y` is large.
   - If no such `y` is found, the function returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1. This is a reasonable fallback because the largest divisor will still maximize `gcd(x, y) + y` to some extent.

4. **Edge Case**:
   - If `x` is a prime number, the only divisors are `1` and `x` itself. Since `y` must be less than `x`, the function will return `1`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function correctly outputs a value for `y` that satisfies the problem's constraints and maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`.

### Correctness:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the optimal `y` for the given problem. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the input `x` and printing the result. The logic within `func_1` ensures that the output is always a valid `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
