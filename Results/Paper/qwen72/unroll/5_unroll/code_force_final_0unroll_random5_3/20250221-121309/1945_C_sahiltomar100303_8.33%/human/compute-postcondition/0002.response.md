Output State: **The loop will have processed all test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed the optimal boundary index (left or right) that balances the number of '0's and '1's as close to the middle as possible, given the constraints. The variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `left`, `leftMove`, and `right` will have been updated and used during the execution of the loop, but their final values will depend on the specific inputs provided for each test case.**
