Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'. The function calculates and prints the optimal boundary index (either `left` or `right`) that balances the number of '0's and '1's as close to the middle of the string as possible, given the constraints. The boundary index is the position where the number of '0's on the left and '1's on the right is as balanced as possible. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and the optimal boundary indices have been printed for each. **
