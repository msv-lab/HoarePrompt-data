### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires generating an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - If no such array exists, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to generate the required sequence.
   - The sequence is then printed along with its length.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will have a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a bit manipulation approach to determine the size and overlap of the sequence.
   - The function iterates over possible values of `i` to find a suitable size and overlap such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.

4. **Bit Manipulation:**
   - The expression `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)` is used to calculate the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with a sequence of length `i + 1`.
   - This is based on the fact that a sequence of length `i + 1` can have \( 2^{i+1} - 2^i = 2^i \) increasing subsequences.
   - The function then appends the necessary elements to the sequence to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Recursive Call:**
   - After appending the elements, the function recursively calls itself to handle the remaining number of increasing subsequences.
   - The recursive call is made with the updated number `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `number` is 0 by returning immediately.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by using a loop that iterates over possible values of `i`.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which should not happen given the constraints), it prints \(-1\).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initial State:**
  - Before the function call, `number` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18} \).
  - `sequence` is an empty list.

- **Function `func_1` Execution:**
  - The function starts by checking if `number` is 0. If it is, it returns `(0, 0)`.
  - It then initializes `size_overlap` to `(0, 0)`.
  - The loop iterates over possible values of `i` from the maximum value in `sequence` (or 0 if `sequence` is empty) down to -1.
  - For each `i`, it calculates `size` and `value` such that `value` is the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with a sequence of length `size`.
  - It then checks if `value` is less than or equal to `number`. If it is, it sets `size_overlap` to `(size, i)` and breaks out of the loop.
  - The function appends integers from `overlap` to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
  - It recursively calls `func_1` with the updated number `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`.

- **Correctness of Bit Manipulation:**
  - The expression `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)` correctly calculates \( 2^i \), which is the number of increasing subsequences for a sequence of length `i + 1`.
  - The loop ensures that the largest possible `size` is chosen such that the number of increasing subsequences does not exceed `number`.

- **Recursive Call:**
  - The recursive call updates `number` correctly to handle the remaining increasing subsequences.
  - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by the way it appends elements and the constraints on `i`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles the case where `number` is 0 by returning immediately.
  - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by the way it appends elements and the constraints on `i`.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
  - If the sequence cannot be generated (which should not happen given the constraints), it prints \(-1\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate an array of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The bit manipulation and recursive approach are sound and should handle the given constraints effectively.
