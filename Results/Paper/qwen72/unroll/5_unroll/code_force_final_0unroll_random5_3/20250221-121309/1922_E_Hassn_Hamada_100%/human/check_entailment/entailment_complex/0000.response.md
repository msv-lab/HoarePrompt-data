Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The function does this by recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems until the `number` (which represents `X - 1` because of the initial call) reaches 0.

2. **Base Case**: The function correctly handles the base case where `number` is 0, returning `(0, 0)` and not modifying the `sequence`.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of `i` starting from the maximum value in the `sequence` (or 0 if the `sequence` is empty) down to -1.
   - For each `i`, it calculates the size and value of the next segment of the sequence that can be added to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - It then appends the necessary integers to the `sequence` and recursively calls itself with the updated `number`.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed by appending integers in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.
   - The function uses the formula `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` to calculate the number of increasing subsequences that can be added by appending a segment of length `size - i` starting from `i`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `number` is 0 by returning immediately.
   - The function should also handle cases where `number` is large, but the maximum length of the sequence is 200. However, the function does not explicitly check for this condition, which could lead to an incorrect sequence if the recursion goes too deep.

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself after the recursive calls.
   - If the function fails to construct a valid sequence (which should not happen given the constraints and the logic), it should print `-1`. However, the function does not have a mechanism to detect and report this failure.

7. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function does not handle the case where the sequence length exceeds 200. If the recursion goes too deep, it could append more than 200 elements to the sequence.
   - The function does not explicitly return a value that indicates whether the sequence was successfully constructed or not, which could lead to incorrect results if the sequence construction fails.

Given these points, the program is not fully correct because it lacks a mechanism to ensure the sequence length does not exceed 200 and to report failure if the sequence cannot be constructed.

Correctness: **False**
