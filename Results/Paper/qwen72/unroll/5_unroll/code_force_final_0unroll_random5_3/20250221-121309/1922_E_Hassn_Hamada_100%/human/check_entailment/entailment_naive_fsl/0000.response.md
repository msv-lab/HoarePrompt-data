Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when \( X = 1 \). According to the problem description, \( X \) can be as low as 2, but the program's logic does not account for the edge case where \( X = 1 \). Additionally, the function `func_1` is not clearly documented, and the logic for generating the sequence is complex and not easily verifiable for correctness. For example, if \( X = 2 \), the program should output an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences, but the current implementation may not always produce the correct output. 

To further illustrate, let's consider the input \( X = 2 \):
- The program should output an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences.
- However, the current implementation might not always produce such an array, and the logic for generating the sequence is not straightforward.

For \( X = 2 \), a correct output could be:
```
2
0 1
```
But the program might produce:
```
1
0
```
which has only 1 increasing subsequence, not 2. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
