Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #State: `size_overlap` is a tuple where the first element is the largest `size` such that `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number` and the second element is the corresponding `i` value. The `sequence` and `number` variables remain unchanged.
    size, overlap = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
        
    #State: `size` and `number` remain unchanged, `overlap` remains unchanged, `size_overlap` remains unchanged, `sequence` is now a list containing integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`.
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It modifies the `sequence` list by appending a series of integers and always returns the tuple (0, 0). The `sequence` list is updated to include integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`, where `size` and `overlap` are determined based on the input `number`. The function is recursive, and the `number` is reduced in each recursive call until it reaches 0. After the function concludes, the `sequence` list contains a series of integers that represent a specific transformation of the input `number`, and the function returns (0, 0).
