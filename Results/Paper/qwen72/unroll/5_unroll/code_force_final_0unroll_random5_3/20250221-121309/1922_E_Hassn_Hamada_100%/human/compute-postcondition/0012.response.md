Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It modifies the `sequence` list by appending a series of integers and always returns the tuple (0, 0). The `sequence` list is updated to include integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`, where `size` and `overlap` are determined based on the input `number`. The function is recursive, and the `number` is reduced in each recursive call until it reaches 0. After the function concludes, the `sequence` list contains a series of integers that represent a specific transformation of the input `number`, and the function returns (0, 0). **
