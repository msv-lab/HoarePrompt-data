Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9], `size_overlap` is (0, 0).**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `size_overlap`, which is now a tuple with both elements set to 0.
