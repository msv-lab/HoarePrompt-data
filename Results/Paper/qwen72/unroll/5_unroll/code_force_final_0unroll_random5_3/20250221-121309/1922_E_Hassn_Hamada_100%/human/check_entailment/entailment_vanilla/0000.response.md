### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - If no such array exists, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to generate the required sequence.
   - The sequence is then printed along with its length.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will have a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a bit manipulation approach to determine the size and overlap of the sequence.
   - The function iterates over possible values of `i` to find a suitable size and overlap such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.

4. **Bit Manipulation:**
   - The expression `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)` is used to calculate the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with a sequence of length `i + 1`.
   - This is based on the fact that a sequence of length `i + 1` can have \( 2^{i+1} - 2^i = 2^i \) increasing subsequences.
   - The function then appends the necessary elements to the sequence to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Recursive Call:**
   - After appending the elements, the function recursively calls itself to handle the remaining number of increasing subsequences.
   - The recursive call is made with the updated number `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `number` is 0 by returning immediately.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by using a loop that iterates over possible values of `i`.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which should not happen given the constraints), it prints \(-1\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate an array of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The bit manipulation and recursive approach are sound and should handle the given constraints effectively.

### Correctness:
**True**
