Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three inputs: an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20), and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then reads another string `c` of the same length. The function checks if for each character position `i` in the strings `a` and `b`, at least one of the characters matches the corresponding character in `c`. If this condition is met for all positions, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, a result ('YES' or 'NO') has been printed based on the input strings. **
