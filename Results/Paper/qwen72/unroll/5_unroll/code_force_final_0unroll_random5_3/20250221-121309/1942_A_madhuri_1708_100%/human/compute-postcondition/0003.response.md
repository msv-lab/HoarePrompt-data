The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is the length of the array, and `k` is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function returns an array of length `n` that has been cyclically shifted `k` times in a sorted manner.
