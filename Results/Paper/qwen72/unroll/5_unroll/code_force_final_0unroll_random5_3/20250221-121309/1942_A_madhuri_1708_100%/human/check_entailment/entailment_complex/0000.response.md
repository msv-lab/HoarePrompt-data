Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads from the standard input, which is appropriate for the problem. It processes each line to extract `n` and `k` using `map(int, s.split())`, which is correct for the input format described.

2. **Conditions for Valid Arrays**:
   - **Case 1: `k >= 2` and `n == k`**:
     - The function prints an array of `k` elements, each being `k`. This is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this array will be sorted. For example, if `n = k = 3`, the array `[3, 3, 3]` will have all three cyclic shifts `[3, 3, 3]`, `[3, 3, 3]`, and `[3, 3, 3]` sorted.
   - **Case 2: `k >= 2` and `n != k`**:
     - The function prints `-1`. This is correct because if `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is not equal to `k`, it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, no array can have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts.
   - **Case 3: `k < 2`**:
     - The function prints an array of `n` elements, each being the index `j + 1` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`). This is correct because if `k = 1`, the array will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself. If `k = 0`, the array will have no sorted cyclic shifts, which is not possible according to the problem constraints (since `1 ≤ k ≤ n`).

3. **Output Format**: The function prints the results in the correct format as described in the problem statement. Each test case is processed and printed on a new line.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `k = 1` by printing a sequence of unique integers.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `k = n` by printing an array of `k` elements, each being `k`.

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The function correctly identifies when a valid array can be constructed and when it cannot.
   - The logic for constructing the array in the valid cases is sound and meets the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to be correct and meets all the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
