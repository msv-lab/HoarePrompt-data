Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. The main issues are:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values as strings and appends them to the list `a`. However, the elements of the array should be integers, not strings. This can be fixed by converting each element to an integer using `int(ai)`.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with `len(a)` as an argument, which is the length of the array. However, the function expects the array itself, not its length. The function should be called with `a` as an argument.

3. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` only handles the case where the length of the array is 2 and prints a hardcoded output. It does not handle other lengths of the array or compute the MEX value as required by the problem. The function should compute the MEX value for the subarray and apply the operation to maximize the sum of the array.

4. **Output Format**: The function does not follow the required output format. It should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves. The current implementation only prints hardcoded values and does not construct the sequence of operations.

5. **MEX Calculation**: The program does not include any logic to calculate the MEX of a subarray, which is a crucial part of the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not solve the problem as described and is therefore incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
