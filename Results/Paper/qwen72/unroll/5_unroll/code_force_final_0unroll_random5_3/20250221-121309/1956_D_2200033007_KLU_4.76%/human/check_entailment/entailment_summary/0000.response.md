Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description and the examples given. The function `func_1` does not actually compute the maximum sum of the array elements or the sequence of operations needed to achieve that sum. Instead, it simply prints a fixed output based on the length of the array, which is not a general solution to the problem.

Here are the specific issues:
1. **Fixed Output**: The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases: when the length of the array is 2, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2", and for all other lengths, it prints "13 0". This does not account for the actual values in the array or the required operations to maximize the sum.

2. **No Computation**: The function does not perform any computation to determine the MEX of any subarray or to apply the operations to the array. It simply prints a fixed output, which is not a valid solution for the problem.

3. **Incorrect Output for General Cases**: For arrays of length other than 2, the function always prints "13 0", which is incorrect. For example, in the third test case, the correct output should be "105 2" with the operations "3 3" and "3 4".

4. **Ignoring Input Values**: The program reads the input values but does not use them in any meaningful way to solve the problem. It only passes the length of the array to `func_1`.

Given these issues, the program does not solve the problem as described and does not produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
