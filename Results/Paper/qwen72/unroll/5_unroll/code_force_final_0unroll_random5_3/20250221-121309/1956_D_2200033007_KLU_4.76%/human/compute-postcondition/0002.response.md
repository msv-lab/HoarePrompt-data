Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 18`.
- Each element `a_i` in `c` satisfies `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`.
- `m` is 0.
- The current value of `c` is 2.

### Analysis:
- The statement `The current value of c is 2` is a bit ambiguous. It could mean that the list `c` contains a single element which is 2, or it could mean that the length of the list `c` is 2. However, since the precondition specifies that `c` is a list of integers, it is more likely that `c` contains a single element which is 2.
- The print statement `print(f'4 1')` is a formatted string that will print the literal string "4 1" regardless of the values of `c` or `m`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the literal string "4 1".
Output: **4 1**
