Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 18\).
- Each element \(a_i\) in `c` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `m` is 0.
- The current value of `c` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'1 2')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is a formatted string that directly prints the text `'1 2'`.
- The values of `c`, `m`, and the elements within `c` are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any variables or conditions from the initial state.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'1 2'` exactly as it is written in the code.

Output: **1 2**
