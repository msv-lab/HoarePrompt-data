Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it only handles two specific cases (array length of 2 and other lengths) with hardcoded outputs, which is not a general solution.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the program will output:
```
13 0
```
This is incorrect because the program does not compute the MEX for the given subarray and does not perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
