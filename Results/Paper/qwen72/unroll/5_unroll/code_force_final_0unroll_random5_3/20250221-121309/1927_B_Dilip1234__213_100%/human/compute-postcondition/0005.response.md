The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of a string. The function returns a string `s` of length `n`, where each character in `s` is determined by the trace `a` and the `char_count` array. The `char_count` array represents the number of times each character from 'a' to 'z' has been added to `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns a string `s` of length `n` where each character in `s` is determined by the trace `a` and the count of each character from 'a' to 'z' that has been added to `s`.**
