Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string, `s` is a string of length n where each character is determined by the trace `a` and the `char_count` array, `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where each element represents the number of times the corresponding character (from 'a' to 'z') has been added to `s`.**
