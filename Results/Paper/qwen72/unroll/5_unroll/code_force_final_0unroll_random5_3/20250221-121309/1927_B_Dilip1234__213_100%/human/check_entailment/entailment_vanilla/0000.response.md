### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the length of the string) and `a` (the trace array).
   - It initializes an empty string `s` and an array `char_count` of length 26, all initialized to 0. This array will keep track of the number of occurrences of each character in the string `s`.

3. **Building the String**:
   - The program iterates over each element in the trace array `a`.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it searches for a character in the range 'a' to 'z' (represented by indices 0 to 25) whose count in `char_count` matches `a[i]`.
   - Once it finds such a character, it appends it to the string `s` and increments the count of that character in `char_count`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed string `s` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly constructs a string `s` that matches the given trace array `a`.
  - The trace array `a` is defined such that `a[i]` is the number of previous occurrences of the character `s[i]` in the string `s`.
  - The program ensures that for each `a[i]`, it finds a character whose count matches `a[i]` and appends it to the string `s`.
  - The use of `char_count` ensures that the correct character is chosen based on its previous occurrences.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly by printing a single character (e.g., 'a').
  - It also handles the case where all elements in `a` are 0 by printing a string of the same character repeated `n` times (e.g., 'aaaaaaa' for `n = 8` and `a = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`).

- **Performance**:
  - The program has a time complexity of O(n * 26) for each test case, which simplifies to O(n) since 26 is a constant.
  - Given the constraints (sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5), the program should run efficiently within the limits.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
