You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and it is guaranteed that for the given trace, there exists a suitable string s.
def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string, `s` is a string of length n where each character is determined by the trace `a` and the `char_count` array, `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where each element represents the number of times the corresponding character (from 'a' to 'z') has been added to `s`.
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s` of length `n`, where each character in `s` is determined by the trace `a` and the `char_count` array. The `char_count` array represents the number of times each character from 'a' to 'z' has been added to `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns a string `s` of length `n` where each character in `s` is determined by the trace `a` and the count of each character from 'a' to 'z' that has been added to `s`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string `s` of length `n`, where each character in `s` is determined by the trace `a` and the `char_count` array. The `char_count` array represents the number of times each character from 'a' to 'z' has been added to `s`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
