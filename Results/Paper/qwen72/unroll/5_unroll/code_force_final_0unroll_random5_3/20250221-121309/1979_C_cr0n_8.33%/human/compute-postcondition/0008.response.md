Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `prod` is the product of all integers in the `vals` list.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - `den` is `prod` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`.
   - `den` is less than or equal to 0.
   - All other variables (`t`, `cases`, `N`) remain unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `prod` is the product of all elements in the `vals` list.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is calculated as `prod / vals[i]` for each `i` in the range of the length of `vals`.
   - `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - Given that `den` is less than or equal to 0, we know that `prod - sum(vprod) <= 0`.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

4. **Explanation:**
   - The code snippet simply prints the integer `-1`.
   - The value of `-1` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
