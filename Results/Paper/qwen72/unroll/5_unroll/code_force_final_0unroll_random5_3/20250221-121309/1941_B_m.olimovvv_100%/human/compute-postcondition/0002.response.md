The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_j` is such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what the function returns. However, we can describe the parameters it accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 10^4), `n` (an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5), and `a` (a list of `n` integers, each between 0 and 10^9).**
