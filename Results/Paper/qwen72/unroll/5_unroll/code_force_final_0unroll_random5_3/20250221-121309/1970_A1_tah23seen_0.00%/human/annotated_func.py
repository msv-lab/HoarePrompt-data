The length of `ans` is the same as `s`, and `d` remains a sorted list of tuples containing indices and their corresponding depths.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans`, which contains the characters of `s` rearranged in such a way that the characters are ordered by their depth in the balanced parentheses sequence, from the shallowest to the deepest. The length of `ans` is the same as `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and returns a new string `ans` where the characters are ordered by their depth in the parentheses sequence, from the shallowest to the deepest. The length of `ans` is the same as `s`.
