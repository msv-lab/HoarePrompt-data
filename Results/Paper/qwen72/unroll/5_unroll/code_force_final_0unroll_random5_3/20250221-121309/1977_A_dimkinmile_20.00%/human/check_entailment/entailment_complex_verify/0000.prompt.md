You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: *`n` and `m` are assigned the values of two non-negative integers provided by the user, where 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 100. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `m`. If `n` is less than `m`, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where 1 <= n, m <= 100. It then compares these two values and prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and 'No' if `n` is less than `m`. The function does not handle multiple test cases or accept any parameters. After the function concludes, `n` and `m` retain their input values, and the program state reflects the printed result based on the comparison of `n` and `m`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The function checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes) and prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise. However, this logic is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that Nikita can both add and remove cubes in his moves.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`. According to the problem description, Nikita cannot achieve a tower with 4 cubes after only 2 moves, because he can only add or remove 1 cube per move. The correct answer should be "No", but the program will incorrectly output "Yes" because `n` (2) is less than `m` (4).

Another example is `n = 3` and `m = 1`. The program will output "Yes" because `n` (3) is greater than or equal to `m` (1), but the correct answer should be "No" because after 3 moves, Nikita cannot have exactly 1 cube in the tower. He can have 0, 2, or 3 cubes, but not 1.

To correctly solve this problem, the function should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, because each move can either add or remove 1 cube, and the net effect of an even number of moves is that the tower can have an even number of cubes added or removed. The correct logic would be:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This logic ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases.
