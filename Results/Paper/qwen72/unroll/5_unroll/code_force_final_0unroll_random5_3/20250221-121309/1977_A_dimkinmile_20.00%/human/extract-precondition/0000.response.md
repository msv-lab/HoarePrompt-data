Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be defined as:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `m`.
