The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes the variables `n` and `m` as non-negative integers provided by the user, with the constraint that `1 <= n, m <= 100` and `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Additionally, the function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where `1 <= t <= 100`.

However, the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
