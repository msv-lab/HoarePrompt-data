### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, from the input. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program iterates over each test case using a `for` loop, which is appropriate for handling multiple test cases as specified.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the program calls the function `func_1()` for each test case. The function `func_1` reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input. This is correct and matches the problem's requirement.

4. **Condition Check**: The original program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` using the condition `if n >= m:`. This is indeed incorrect because it does not account for the parity of `n` and `m`. The problem requires determining if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, which depends on both the number of moves and the parity of the numbers.

5. **Parity Consideration**: The original assessment correctly identifies that the parity of `n` and `m` must be the same for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because:
   - Starting from 0 cubes, each move changes the number of cubes by 1.
   - Therefore, after an even number of moves, the number of cubes will be even.
   - After an odd number of moves, the number of cubes will be odd.
   - Hence, `n` and `m` must have the same parity for the condition to be satisfied.

6. **Output**: The original program prints "Yes" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and "No" otherwise. This is incorrect for the reasons stated above. The corrected condition should be `if n >= m and (n % 2 == m % 2)`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n % 2 == m % 2):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not account for the parity of `n` and `m`. The corrected program, which includes the parity check, is the correct solution to the problem.

Final: **False**
