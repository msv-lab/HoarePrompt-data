The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` consisting of "+" and "-" characters and a positive integer `length` that matches the length of `expression`. It returns the number of times the balance (tracked by the number of "+" and "-" characters) goes below zero during the processing of the string, plus 1 if the final balance is greater than 0. If the final balance is not greater than 0, the function returns the number of times the balance went below zero.
