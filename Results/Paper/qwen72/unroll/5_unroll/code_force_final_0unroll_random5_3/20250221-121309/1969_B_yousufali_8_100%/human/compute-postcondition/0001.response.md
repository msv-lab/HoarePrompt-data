The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Since `t` is read from the standard input and is assigned a value that satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, we can assume that `t` is already within this range. However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to explicitly state that `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
