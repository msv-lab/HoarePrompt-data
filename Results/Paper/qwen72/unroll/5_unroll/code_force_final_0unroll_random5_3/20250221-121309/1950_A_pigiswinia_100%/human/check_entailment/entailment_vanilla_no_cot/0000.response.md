Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads three digits and checks if they form a "STAIR" (a < b < c), a "PEAK" (a < b > c), or neither, and prints the appropriate result for each test case. The logic and the input/output handling are consistent with the problem requirements.
