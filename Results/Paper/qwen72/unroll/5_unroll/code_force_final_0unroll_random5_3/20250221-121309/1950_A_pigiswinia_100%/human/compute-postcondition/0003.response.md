The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list or tuple of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The number of test cases `t` should be a non-negative integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing three digits (a, b, c) where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and the number of test cases is between 1 and 1000. The function returns the result of processing each test case.**
