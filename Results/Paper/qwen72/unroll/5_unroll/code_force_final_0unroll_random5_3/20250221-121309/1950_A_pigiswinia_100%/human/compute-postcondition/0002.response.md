Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it will print 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be overwritten in each iteration, and the loop variable `i` will increment from 0 to `t-1`. After the loop finishes, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values read in the last iteration, and `i` will be equal to `t`.**
