Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled using `t = int(input())`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that iterates `t` times, which is appropriate for processing multiple test cases.

3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three space-separated integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. This is the correct way to read three integers from a single line of input.

4. **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct according to the problem description.

5. **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correct according to the problem description.

6. **Default Case**: If neither the stair nor the peak condition is met, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct default case as per the problem description.

7. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

Given that the program correctly handles the input, processes the conditions, and produces the correct output for each test case, it meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
