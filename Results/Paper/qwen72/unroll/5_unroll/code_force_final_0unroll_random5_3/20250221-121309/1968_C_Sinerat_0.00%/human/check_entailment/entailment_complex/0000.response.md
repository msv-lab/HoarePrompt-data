### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`**:
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 500. This is a valid choice because \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) and 500 is within this range.

2. **Construction of `a`**:
   - The program constructs the array `a` such that \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\) for \(1 \le i < n\).
   - This construction ensures that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) because \(a_i\) is exactly \(a_{i-1} + x_i\), and the remainder of \(a_i\) divided by \(a_{i-1}\) is \(x_i\).

3. **Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) by starting with 500 and adding values from `x` which are at most 500. Since \(a_i\) is constructed as \(a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\), and both \(a_{i-1}\) and \(x_{i-1}\) are within the range \([1, 10^9]\), \(a_i\) will also be within the range \([1, 10^9]\).

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `x`, constructs the array `a`, and prints it.

5. **Output**:
   - The output format is correct as it prints the array `a` as a space-separated list of integers for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
