Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the initial value of `a[0]` is set to 500, which may not always satisfy the condition \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) and the modulo condition for the subsequent elements. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
2 4 1
```
The program will generate the array `a = [500, 502, 506, 507]`. However, this does not satisfy the condition \(x_3 = a_3 \bmod a_2\), because \(506 \bmod 502 = 4\) is correct, but \(507 \bmod 506 = 1\) is also correct. The issue arises when the values of `x` are such that the initial value of 500 does not work. 

A correct approach would be to initialize `a[0]` with a value that is greater than the maximum possible value of `x` and then construct the array `a` accordingly. For example, setting `a[0]` to \(10^9\) would ensure that the modulo condition is always satisfied.
