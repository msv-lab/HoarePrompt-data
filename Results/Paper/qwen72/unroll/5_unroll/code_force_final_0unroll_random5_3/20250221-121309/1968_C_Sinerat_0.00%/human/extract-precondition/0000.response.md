Precondition: **The function should accept a list of integers `x` where `1 <= len(x) <= 500` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The function should also accept an integer `n` where `2 <= n <= 500`, and `n` is the length of the array `a` that needs to be constructed. The function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where `1 <= t <= 10^4`.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to accept the necessary parameters. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def find_array(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers.
