The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `x`. For each test case, it constructs an array `a` of length `n` such that `a[0]` is always 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `1 <= i < n`) is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`. The final state of `a` for each test case is printed as a space-separated list of integers. The function does not return any value.
