### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns to either swap their wallets or keep their current wallets, followed by removing 1 coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., the player whose wallet is empty and cannot remove a coin) loses the game.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game can be analyzed based on the total number of coins \( a + b \).
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will end in a draw or Bob will win because Alice will always be the one to make the first move, and Bob can mirror Alice's strategy to ensure that Alice is the one who cannot make a move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will have the advantage because she can always ensure that Bob is the one who cannot make a move.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It then checks if the sum \( a + b \) is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` from user input, splits the string into two integers `a` and `b`, and prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, otherwise it prints 'Alice'.
   - The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `a` and `b` will hold the values from the last test case.

5. **Validation of Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight that the winner can be determined by the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins.
   - The program's logic is sound and matches the reasoning provided in the original assessment.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the appropriate winner for each case based on the sum of the coins.

6. **Edge Cases and Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where \( a \) and \( b \) are both 1 (as shown in the example).
   - It also correctly handles cases where the total number of coins is large (up to \( 10^9 \)), as the sum and modulo operations are efficient and will not cause issues within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the reasoning provided. The logic and implementation align with the optimal strategy for both players, and the function summary confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Final: **True**
