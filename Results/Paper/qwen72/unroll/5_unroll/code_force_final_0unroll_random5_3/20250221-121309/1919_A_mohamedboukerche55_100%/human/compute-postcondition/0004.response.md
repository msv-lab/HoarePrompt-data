Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from user input, splits the string into two integers `a` and `b`, and prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, otherwise it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `a` and `b` will hold the values from the last test case. **
