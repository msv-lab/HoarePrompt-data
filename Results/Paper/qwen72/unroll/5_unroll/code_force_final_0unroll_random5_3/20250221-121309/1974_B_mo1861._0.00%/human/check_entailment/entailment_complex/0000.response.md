Reasoning:

The program is intended to decode a string that was encoded using the algorithm described. The algorithm for encoding involves creating an auxiliary string `r` from the distinct, sorted characters of the original string `s`, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`. To decode, we need to reverse this process.

1. **Character Mapping Creation**:
   - The program creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character in the encoded string `b` is mapped to a character in reverse alphabetical order. However, this part of the program is incorrect. The mapping should be based on the distinct, sorted characters of the original string `s`, not the entire alphabet. The correct approach would be to map each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted, distinct characters of `b`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The program then iterates over each character in the encoded string `b` and replaces it with the corresponding character from the `char_map` dictionary to form the decoded string `s`.

3. **Output**:
   - The decoded string `s` is printed for each test case.

The issue lies in the creation of the `char_map` dictionary. Instead of mapping characters to the reverse of the entire alphabet, it should map characters to their symmetric counterparts in the sorted, distinct characters of the encoded string `b`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Create a sorted list of distinct characters in b
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    # Create a mapping from each character to its symmetric counterpart
    char_map = {distinct_chars[i]: distinct_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(distinct_chars))}
    
    #State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from the string `b` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted, distinct characters of `b`. The length of `b` remains unchanged, and `b` is still a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: `s` is a string where each character from `b` has been replaced by the corresponding character from the `char_map` dictionary, and the length of `s` is the same as the length of `b`. The `char_map` dictionary remains unchanged.
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s`, where each character from the original string `b` has been replaced by the corresponding character from the `char_map` dictionary, and the length of `s` is the same as the length of `b`.
```

Given the incorrect character mapping in the original program, the program will not produce the correct decoded string for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
