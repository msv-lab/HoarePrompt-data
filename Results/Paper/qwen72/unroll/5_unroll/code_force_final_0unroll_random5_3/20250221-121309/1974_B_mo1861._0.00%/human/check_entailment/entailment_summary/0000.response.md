Reasoning:  
The program is designed to decode a string that has been encoded according to a specific algorithm. The encoding algorithm constructs a new string `r` from the distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order, and then each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. To decode, the program should reverse this process.

However, there is a critical mistake in the decoding logic within the function `func_1`:

1. **Character Mapping**: The program creates a character mapping `char_map` where each character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character in reverse alphabetical order. This is incorrect because the mapping should be based on the symmetric positions within the set of distinct characters, not the entire alphabet.

2. **Symmetric Mapping**: The correct approach would be to map the first character in the sorted set to the last, the second to the second last, and so on. The current implementation maps the first character to the last character of the entire alphabet, which is not what the problem requires.

3. **Correct Mapping**: The correct mapping should be based on the length of the set of distinct characters, not the length of the string `b`.

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {}
    for i in range(len(distinct_chars)):
        char_map[distinct_chars[i]] = distinct_chars[-(i + 1)]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

Given the current implementation, the program will not produce the correct output for the given test cases. For example, for the input "serofedsoc", the current implementation will produce an incorrect output because it maps characters based on the entire alphabet, not the distinct characters in the string.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
