Functionality: **The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are lists of integers of the same length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and both are sorted in non-decreasing order with elements in the range 1 to 10^9. However, the provided function definition only accepts a single parameter `arr`. If the function were to be called with the correct parameters, it would be expected to return a list sorted in non-increasing order. As it stands, the function will raise a NameError because `arr` is not defined in the initial state.**
