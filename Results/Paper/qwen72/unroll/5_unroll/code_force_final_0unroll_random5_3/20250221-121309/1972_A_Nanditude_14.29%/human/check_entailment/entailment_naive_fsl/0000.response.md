Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the logic for inserting and sorting the new problem difficulty is flawed. The program attempts to insert the new problem difficulty directly at the current position `i` and then removes the last element, which does not always ensure that the array `a` remains sorted correctly.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- The program starts with `a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]` and `b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]`.
- In the first iteration, `b[0] = 800` is less than `a[0] = 1000`, so the program inserts `800` at the beginning of `a` and removes the last element, resulting in `a = [800, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2000]`.
- The array `a` is now `[800, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2000]`, which is not sorted correctly.
- The program then continues to the next iteration, but since `a` is not sorted, it may not correctly identify the next problem to insert or remove.

The correct approach should involve inserting the new difficulty `w` into the sorted array `a` and then removing the last element to ensure `a` remains sorted. The provided program does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
