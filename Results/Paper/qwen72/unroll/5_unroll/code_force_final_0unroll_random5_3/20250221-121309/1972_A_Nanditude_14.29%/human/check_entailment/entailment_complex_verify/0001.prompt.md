You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(a, b):` where `a` and `b` are lists of integers, both of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and both are sorted in non-decreasing order with elements in the range 1 to 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a list `arr` sorted in non-increasing order. However, since `arr` is not defined in the initial state, the program will raise a NameError.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `arr`, which is expected to be a list. It returns a new list that is the sorted version of `arr` in non-increasing order. If `arr` is not provided or is not a list, the function will raise a TypeError.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected problem difficulties.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems proposed.
   - It also initializes two indices `i` and `j` to 0, which will be used to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program enters a while loop that continues as long as both `i` and `j` are less than `n`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`.
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem is too difficult and needs to be adjusted:
     - The program removes the last element from `a` using `a.pop(-1)`.
     - It then inserts the expected difficulty `b[j]` at the current position `i` in the array `a`.
     - The counter `cnt` is incremented, and the index `j` is moved to the next expected difficulty.
   - If `b[j] >= a[i]`, it means the current problem is within the expected difficulty, so both indices `i` and `j` are incremented.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the counter `cnt`, which represents the number of new problems proposed.

5. **Function `func_1` (Unused):**
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never used in the program. This function sorts an array in descending order, which is not relevant to the problem.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the insertion and deletion of elements in the array `a` to ensure that the difficulties are non-decreasing.
- The logic of comparing `b[j]` with `a[i]` and adjusting `a` accordingly is sound.
- However, there is a potential issue with the way the array `a` is modified:
  - The program uses `a.pop(-1)` to remove the last element and then inserts `b[j]` at the current position `i`.
  - This approach does not maintain the non-decreasing order of `a` after each insertion, which is a requirement of the problem.

### Correct Solution:
To maintain the non-decreasing order of `a` after each insertion, the program should use a more efficient method to insert the new difficulty. One way to do this is to use a binary search to find the correct position for the new difficulty and then insert it.

### Conclusion:
The program is **incorrect** because it does not maintain the non-decreasing order of `a` after each insertion, which is a critical requirement of the problem.

### Correctness:
**False**
