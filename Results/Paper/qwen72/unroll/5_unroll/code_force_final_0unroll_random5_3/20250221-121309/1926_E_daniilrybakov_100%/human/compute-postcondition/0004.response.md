Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function performs calculations based on these inputs and prints a result for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function does not return any value, and the state of the input variables `t`, `n`, and `k` is unchanged. The internal variables `s` and `m` are reset for each test case, so their final values are not meaningful after the function completes. **
