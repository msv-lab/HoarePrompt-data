Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n` and `k` from input, performs calculations, and prints a result. After all iterations, `t` is unchanged, and the values of `n` and `k` for the next iteration are undefined (as they are read from input). The variables `s` and `m` are reset to 0 and 1 at the start of each iteration, so their final values are not meaningful after the loop completes.**
