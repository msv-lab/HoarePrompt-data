The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of the `int(input())` expression, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. If this value is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state provided does not directly affect the loop head, but it does provide context for the input. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `int(input())` ≤ 10^4**
