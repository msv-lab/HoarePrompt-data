The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`.

The function returns different outputs based on the input values:
- Case_1: If `t` is out of the valid range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the function returns an error message indicating that the number of test cases is invalid.
- Case_2: If `n` is out of the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), the function returns an error message indicating that the number of elements in the list is invalid.
- Case_3: If the sum of elements in `a` is not divisible by `n`, the function returns an error message indicating that the sum condition is not met.
- Case_4: If all input constraints are satisfied, the function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (number of elements in the list), and `a` (a list of integers). It returns an error message if `t` is out of the valid range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), if `n` is out of the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), or if the sum of elements in `a` is not divisible by `n`. If all constraints are satisfied, the function returns a result for each test case.**
