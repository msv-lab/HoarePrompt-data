Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks the difference between each element and the last element in the array, which is not a valid criterion for determining if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to check if the water can be evenly distributed by ensuring that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, and then checking if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from containers with more water to containers with less water, adhering to the rule that water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip(). split()))
        target = sum(nums) // n  # The target amount of water in each container
        possible = True
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if nums[i] < target:
                possible = False
                break
            nums[i + 1] += nums[i] - target
        print('YES' if possible and nums[-1] == target else 'NO')

func()
```

This version calculates the target amount of water each container should have and then iterates through the containers, ensuring that water can be poured from each container to the next one to reach the target amount. If at any point a container has less water than the target, it is impossible to achieve the goal, and the program outputs "NO". If all containers can be adjusted to the target amount, the program outputs "YES".
