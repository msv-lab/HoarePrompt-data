You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of a_i is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        last = nums[-1]
        
        curr = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. After processing, it prints 'YES' if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element in `nums` is zero, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged outside of the loop, but `n` and `nums` are redefined within each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (number of elements in the list), and `a` (a list of integers). It returns an error message if `t` is out of the valid range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), if `n` is out of the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), or if the sum of elements in `a` is not divisible by `n`. If all constraints are satisfied, the function returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
