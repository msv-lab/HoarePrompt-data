Functionality: ** The function reads `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It then calculates the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element in `nums`. If this sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` (if they exist) are not modified outside of the function. **
