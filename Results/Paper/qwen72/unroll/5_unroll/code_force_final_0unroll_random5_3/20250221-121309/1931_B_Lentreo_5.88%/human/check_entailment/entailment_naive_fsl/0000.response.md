Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, it only checks if the difference between the sum of the elements and the last element is zero, which is not a valid approach to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

The program will output:
```
NO
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
YES
```

This is because the sum of the elements is 6, which is divisible by 3, and it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water (2 units each) by pouring 1 unit from the third container to the first container. The program fails to consider the possibility of redistributing water to achieve the same amount in all containers.
