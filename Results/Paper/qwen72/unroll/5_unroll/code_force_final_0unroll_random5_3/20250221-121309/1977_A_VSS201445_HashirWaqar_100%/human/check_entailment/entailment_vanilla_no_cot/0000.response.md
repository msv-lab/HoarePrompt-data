Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. The logic checks if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves, given that each move can either add or remove a single cube. The conditions for this to be possible are:

1. `n` must be at least as large as `m` (because you can't have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves you've made).
2. The difference between `n` and `m` must be even. This is because each move that adds a cube must be balanced by a move that removes a cube to achieve a specific height, and the net effect of an even number of such moves (add and remove) can be zero, allowing the tower to potentially reach the exact height `m`.

The program correctly implements these conditions and outputs "YES" or "NO" based on whether both conditions are met. Therefore, the program is correct.
