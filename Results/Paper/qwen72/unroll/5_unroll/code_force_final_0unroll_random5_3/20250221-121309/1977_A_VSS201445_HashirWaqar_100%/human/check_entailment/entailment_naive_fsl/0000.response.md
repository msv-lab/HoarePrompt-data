Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `m`. According to the problem description, if `n` is less than `m`, it should be impossible to build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, the program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This logic fails when `n` is less than `m`.

Example of a failing case:
- Input: `1 2`
- Expected Output: `No`
- Actual Output: `YES` (because the program only checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, which is true for `1 - 2`).

To fix this, the program should include a check to ensure that `n` is at least as large as `m` before proceeding with the other conditions.
