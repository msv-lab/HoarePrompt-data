Precondition: **The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:**

```
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

**Where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
