The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases and is constrained to the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The list `test_cases` contains `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` that contains only 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in `test_cases`. The result for each test case is determined as follows:
- Case_1: If the string `s` in the tuple contains at least one 'B' character, the function returns a specific output based on the content of `s`.
- Case_2: If the string `s` in the tuple does not meet the constraint (i.e., it does not contain at least one 'B' character), the function should handle this as an error or invalid input.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with at least one 'B' character. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. If the string `s` in a test case contains at least one 'B' character, the function returns a specific output based on the content of `s`. If the string `s` does not contain at least one 'B' character, the function returns an error or invalid input message.**
