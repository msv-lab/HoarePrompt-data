### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18).

2. **Array Construction**:
   - The function aims to construct an array `ans` such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `x`.
   - It uses two variables, `max` and `min`, to generate the elements of the array. `max` starts at 100000000 and decreases by 1 for each even `x`, while `min` starts at -100000000 and increases by 1 for each odd `x`.
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes 1, which ensures that the array `ans` will have exactly `x` increasing subsequences.

3. **Subsequence Counting**:
   - The function correctly handles the even and odd cases of `x`:
     - For even `x`, it appends the current `max` value to `ans` and then decreases `max` by 1. This effectively halves `x` and ensures that the new elements can form the required number of increasing subsequences.
     - For odd `x`, it appends the current `min` value to `ans` and then increases `min` by 1. This reduces `x` by 1 and ensures that the new elements can form the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The loop ensures that the array `ans` is constructed in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `x`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the array `t` and then the elements of the array `ans` in reverse order.
   - This output format matches the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not explicitly handle the case where no such array can be generated. However, the problem description does not provide a clear condition under which this would occur, and the function's logic seems to cover all valid inputs within the given range (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18).

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the function appears to correctly generate an array that meets the problem's requirements. The logic for constructing the array and counting the increasing subsequences is sound, and the output format matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
