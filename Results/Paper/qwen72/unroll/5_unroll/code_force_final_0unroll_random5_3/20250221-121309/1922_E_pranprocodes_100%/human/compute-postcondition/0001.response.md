Output State: **The loop will execute for each input value `x` provided. For each `x`, it will print the number of elements in the array `ans` and then the elements of the array `ans` in reverse order. The array `ans` will contain integers that are either the maximum value starting from 100000000 and decreasing by 1 for each even `x`, or the minimum value starting from -100000000 and increasing by 1 for each odd `x`. The loop will continue until `x` becomes 1. After all iterations, the variables `max` and `min` will be updated based on the number of even and odd operations performed, respectively, and `ans` will be reset for each new input `x`.**
