#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle the input and output as described in the problem statement. It should take an integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input and return either -1 if no such array exists, or a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of the array, followed by a list of `n` integers, each in the range [-10^9, 10^9], that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The loop will execute for each input value `x` provided. For each `x`, it will print the number of elements in the array `ans` and then the elements of the array `ans` in reverse order. The array `ans` will contain integers that are either the maximum value starting from 100000000 and decreasing by 1 for each even `x`, or the minimum value starting from -100000000 and increasing by 1 for each odd `x`. The loop will continue until `x` becomes 1. After all iterations, the variables `max` and `min` will be updated based on the number of even and odd operations performed, respectively, and `ans` will be reset for each new input `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) and generates a list of integers `ans` such that the list has exactly `x` increasing subsequences. It prints the length of the list `t` and then the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order. If no such list can be generated, it does not handle this case and will not return -1. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.
