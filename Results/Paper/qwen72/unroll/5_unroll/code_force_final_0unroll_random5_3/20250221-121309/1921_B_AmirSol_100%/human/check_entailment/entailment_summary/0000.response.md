Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations (days) needed to transform the initial state of the boxes (string `s1`) into the desired state (string `s2`). The operations allowed are:
1. Adding a cat to an empty box.
2. Removing a cat from a box.
3. Moving a cat from one box to another.

The function `func_1` calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`). The minimum number of operations required is the maximum of these two values because:
- If more cats need to be added than removed, the number of days required is the number of cats to add.
- If more cats need to be removed than added, the number of days required is the number of cats to remove.
- If the number of cats to add and remove is the same, the number of days required is that number.

This is because each operation can only change the state of one box per day, and the operations are independent (adding a cat in one box does not affect the removal of a cat from another box, and vice versa).

The function correctly counts the number of positions where `s1` has a '0' and `s2` has a '1' (indicating a cat needs to be added) and the number of positions where `s1` has a '1' and `s2` has a '0' (indicating a cat needs to be removed). It then returns the maximum of these two counts, which is the correct approach to determine the minimum number of days required.

The program also correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case, calling `func_1` for each one and printing the result.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
