Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array derived from the string `s`. However, the program simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and prints this difference. This approach does not consider the penalty calculation as defined in the problem statement, which involves splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray based on the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Parsing the string `s` to create the array `a` where `a[i] = 1` if `s[i] = '+'` and `a[i] = -1` if `s[i] = '-'`.
2. Finding an optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.
3. Calculating the penalty for each subarray and summing these penalties to get the total penalty.

The provided program does not perform any of these steps correctly. It only calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the same as the penalty calculation required by the problem.

Correctness: **False**
