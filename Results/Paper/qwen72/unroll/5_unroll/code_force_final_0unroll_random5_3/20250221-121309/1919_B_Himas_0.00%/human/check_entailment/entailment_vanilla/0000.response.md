### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - Each character in the string corresponds to an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
   - We need to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray `c` is defined as `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.
   - The total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - It initializes two counters `P` and `M` to count the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string, respectively.
   - It then calculates the difference `P - M` and prints it.

3. **Evaluating the Program:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string.
   - However, the program does not actually perform the splitting of the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
   - The program simply prints the difference `P - M`, which is not the correct way to calculate the minimum possible penalty.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To minimize the penalty, we should split the array `a` in such a way that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
   - If the sum of the entire array `a` is zero, the minimum penalty is zero because we can split the array into subarrays with sum zero.
   - If the sum of the entire array `a` is not zero, the optimal strategy is to split the array into subarrays of length 1, which will result in a penalty of `|sum(a)|`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not implement the correct logic to minimize the penalty.
   - It simply calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters, which is not the same as the minimum possible penalty.

### Correctness:
**False**
