Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description for verifying strong passwords. It checks for the following:

1. **No digit comes after a letter**: The program iterates through the password and keeps track of the last digit's index. If it encounters a letter after a digit, it immediately returns 'NO'.
2. **Digits are sorted in non-decreasing order**: The program extracts all digits from the password and checks if they are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Letters are sorted in non-decreasing order**: The program extracts all letters from the password and checks if they are sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program also correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases and processing each password accordingly. It returns 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions, and all the conditions are checked thoroughly. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
