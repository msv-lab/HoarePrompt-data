The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`. If the `password` string has at least one character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive. This means the `password` is already in a state that ensures the loop can execute. However, for the first iteration, `char` must be the first character of the `password`.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive, `char` is the first character of `password`**
