Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

# Annotated Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: digits is a list containing all the digits from the string password in the order they appear; letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string password in the order they appear.
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password` in the order they appear; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password` in the order they appear; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if there are no digits.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: *`digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password` in the order they appear; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password` in the order they appear; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if there are no digits. Additionally, `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password` in the order they appear; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password` in the order they appear; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if there are no digits. Additionally, `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `password` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive. It returns 'NO' if the digits in the password are not in non-decreasing order, or if any letter appears after a digit and before another digit. It returns 'YES' if the digits are in non-decreasing order and all letters appear either before or after all digits.
