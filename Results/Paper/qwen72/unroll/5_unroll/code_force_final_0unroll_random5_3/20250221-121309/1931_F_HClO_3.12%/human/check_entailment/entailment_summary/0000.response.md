### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of participants who posted screenshots `m`.

2. **Single Screenshot Case**:
   - If there is only one screenshot (`m == 1`), the function prints 'yes' because a single screenshot can always be consistent with itself.

3. **Multiple Screenshots Case**:
   - The function reads the first two screenshots and extracts the author and the list of other participants.
   - It then creates two lists, `l11` and `l22`, by removing the author of the second screenshot from the first list and the author of the first screenshot from the second list, respectively.
   - If `l11` and `l22` are not equal, the function prints 'no' and skips to the next test case. This is because the order of participants (excluding the authors) should be the same if the screenshots are consistent.

4. **Finding the Insertion Point**:
   - The function initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1, which will store the index where the authors of the first and second screenshots should be inserted to make the lists consistent.
   - It iterates through the lists `l1` and `l2` to find the first mismatch. If the mismatch is due to the presence of `a2` in `l1` and `a1` in `l2`, it sets `idx1` and `idx2` to the current index and breaks the loop.
   - If only one of the authors is found in the mismatch, it sets the corresponding index and updates the pointer `p1` or `p2` to 1.

5. **Inserting the Authors**:
   - If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, it inserts `a2` into `l2` at index `idx1`.
   - If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, it inserts `a1` into `l1` at index `idx2`.
   - If `idx1` equals `idx2` and there are more than two screenshots, it reads the third screenshot and determines the correct list to insert the author based on the order of `a1` and `a2` in `l3`.

6. **Verifying Consistency**:
   - The function reads the remaining screenshots and stores them in a list `val`.
   - It then checks if the order of participants in each remaining screenshot matches the modified list `l` (excluding the author of the screenshot).
   - If any screenshot does not match, the function prints 'no' and breaks the loop.
   - If all screenshots match, the function prints 'yes'.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the single screenshot case.
- For multiple screenshots, it correctly identifies the insertion points and modifies the lists to check for consistency.
- The function ensures that the order of participants is consistent across all screenshots by verifying the modified list against each remaining screenshot.

However, there are a few potential issues:
- The function does not handle the case where `idx1` and `idx2` are both -1, which could happen if the lists are already consistent without any insertion.
- The function does not handle the case where `idx1` and `idx2` are both found but the lists are still inconsistent after the insertion.

Despite these potential issues, the function seems to work correctly for the given examples and the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
