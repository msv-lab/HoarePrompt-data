Output State: **`n` and `m` remain the same as their initial values, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list with the same structure as before, `edges` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by weight, `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class with size `n + 1` and updated parent and rank structures, `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of the edges that were added to the union, `node_u` is the node from the edge with the minimum weight, `node_v` is the node from the edge with the minimum weight, `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are 0, `res` is the result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list.**

The `dfs` function is called with `node_u` as the starting node, `-1` as the parent node, and an empty list as the path. The result of this function call is stored in the variable `res`. The values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, `node_v`, and `colors` remain unchanged. The specific value of `res` depends on the implementation of the `dfs` function, but it is now the result of that function call.
