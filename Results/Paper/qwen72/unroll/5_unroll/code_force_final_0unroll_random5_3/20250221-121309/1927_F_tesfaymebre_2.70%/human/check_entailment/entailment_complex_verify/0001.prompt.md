You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

If the result of the `dfs` call (`res`) is not empty and contains `node_v`, the loop returns `res`. If no such `res` is found, the loop completes, and the state of `curr`, `parent`, `path`, and `colors[curr]` remains unchanged.

    #The program returns an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal in a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex), `parent` (the parent vertex of `curr`), and `path` (the current path in the DFS traversal). The function returns the current path in the DFS traversal if it encounters a vertex that has already been visited and is part of a cycle containing `node_v`. If no such cycle is found, the function returns an empty list. The function marks vertices as visited and processed during the traversal.

#Function 8:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of test cases from the return value of `func_1` and processes each test case by calling `func_6` the specified number of times. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program after the function concludes includes the unchanged number of test cases and the completion of the test case processing.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Graph Construction:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` using `func_3()`.
   - It then constructs the graph using a `defaultdict` of lists and stores the edges in a list `edges` with their weights, vertices, and sorts the edges in descending order of weight.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization:**
   - A `DSU` class is used to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The `DSU` class is initialized with `n + 1` elements (to handle 1-based indexing).

3. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges (from heaviest to lightest).
   - For each edge, it checks if the two vertices are already in the same component using the `find` method.
   - If they are, it means a cycle exists, and the program updates the minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the vertices `node_u` and `node_v` that form this cycle.
   - If they are not in the same component, it unites them using the `union` method.

4. **DFS for Cycle Traversal:**
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find the cycle starting from `node_u`.
   - The `colors` array is used to track the state of each node (0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited).
   - The DFS function `dfs` appends the current node to the path and recursively visits its neighbors.
   - If a node is revisited (i.e., its color is 1), it returns the path, indicating a cycle.
   - The cycle is then printed with the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the length of the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in the order they were traversed.

### Issues:

1. **Cycle Detection Logic:**
   - The program incorrectly updates the union operation when a cycle is detected. The `union` method should only be called when the two vertices are not in the same component.
   - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` should be `if parent_u != parent_v` to ensure the union operation is only performed when the vertices are not already connected.

2. **DFS Cycle Traversal:**
   - The DFS function `dfs` does not correctly handle the cycle detection. It should return the cycle path when it detects a back edge to a node that is already in the path.
   - The current implementation of `dfs` may not return the correct cycle path.

3. **DSU Class:**
   - The `DSU` class is not defined in the provided code. It is assumed to have methods `find` and `union`, but the implementation details are missing.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct as it stands. The cycle detection logic and DFS traversal need to be fixed, and the `DSU` class should be properly defined.

Correctness: **False**
