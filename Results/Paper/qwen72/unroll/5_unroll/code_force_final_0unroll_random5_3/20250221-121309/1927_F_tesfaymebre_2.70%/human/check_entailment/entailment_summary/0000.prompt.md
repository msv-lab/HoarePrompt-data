Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

 Output hints for function1:  Reads an integer value from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the integer value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():

''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the first line of input from the user, with any trailing whitespace removed.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the line into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers read from the input line.

The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the program has a list of integers that were provided in the input line.
Function number 5 :

''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` generates a graph based on a set of vertices and edges, with the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` being integers within the specified range. It then processes the edges to find the minimum weight edge that connects nodes in the same connected component and performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes of this minimum weight edge. The function prints the minimum weight of the edges added to the union and the number of nodes visited during the DFS traversal, followed by the list of nodes visited during the DFS. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

 Output hints for function7:  The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal in a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex), `parent` (the parent vertex of `curr`), and `path` (the current path in the DFS traversal). The function returns the current path in the DFS traversal if it encounters a vertex that has already been visited and is part of a cycle containing `node_v`. If no such cycle is found, the function returns an empty list. The function marks vertices as visited and processed during the traversal.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of test cases from the return value of `func_1` and processes each test case by calling `func_6` the specified number of times. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program after the function concludes includes the unchanged number of test cases and the completion of the test case processing.
