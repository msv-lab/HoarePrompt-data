The function `func_3` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the line into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers read from the input line.
