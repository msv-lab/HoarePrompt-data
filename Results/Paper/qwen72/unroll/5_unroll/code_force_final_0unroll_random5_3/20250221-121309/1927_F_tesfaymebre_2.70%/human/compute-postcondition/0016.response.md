The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. However, the problem statement mentions constraints on `n` and `m`, which are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), representing the number of vertices and edges in a graph, respectively. Since these parameters are not part of the function's signature, they are likely defined or used within the function body. The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified. It is implied that the function operates on predefined or internally generated values of `n` and `m` that represent the number of vertices and edges in a graph, respectively, with the constraints 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5).**
