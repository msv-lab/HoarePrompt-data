n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1)/2, 2 * 10^5), and edges is a list of m tuples, each containing three integers (u, v, w) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. There is at most one edge between each pair of vertices, and the graph does not contain loops. The graph is not necessarily connected, but it is guaranteed to contain at least one simple cycle.
