Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. The function then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and 'NONE' for all other cases. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of inputs from the final iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged. **
