Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program checks for a peak by ensuring that `b` is the maximum of the three digits, but it does not correctly handle the case where `a < b > c` (a true peak). Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

In the corrected version, the condition `a < b > c` is used to check for a peak, which correctly identifies the peak pattern. The original program incorrectly prints "PEAK" for cases where `a` or `c` is the maximum, which is not a valid peak.
