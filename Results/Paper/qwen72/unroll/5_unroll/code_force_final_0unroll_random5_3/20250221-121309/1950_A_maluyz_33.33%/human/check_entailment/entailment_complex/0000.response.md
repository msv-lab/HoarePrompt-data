Reasoning:  
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. It then iterates `t` times, each time reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Stair Condition**: The condition `a < b < c` correctly checks if the digits form a stair. If this condition is met, the function prints 'STAIR'.

3. **Peak Condition**: The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` checks if `b` is the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`. This is a valid check for a peak because it ensures that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

4. **None Condition**: If neither the stair nor the peak conditions are met, the function prints 'NONE'. This covers all other cases, including when `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as `a == b == c` by printing 'NONE', which is correct according to the problem description.

6. **Output**: The function prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions provided.

However, there is a small issue with the peak condition. The current implementation will print 'PEAK' even if `a` and `c` are equal, which is not strictly correct. The correct peak condition should be `a < b > c`.

Given this, the function is almost correct but has a minor flaw in the peak condition. To fix this, the peak condition should be updated to `a < b > c`.

Correctness: **False**

To correct the function, the peak condition should be updated as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this update, the function will correctly identify peaks and stairs.
