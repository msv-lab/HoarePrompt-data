Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to be called multiple times with different sets of three digits a, b, and c, where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and the total number of calls t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of three digits input by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The variable `t` will remain unchanged. The loop will have printed 'STAIR' for each set of inputs where `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' for each set where `b` is the maximum value, and 'NONE' for all other cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. The function then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and 'NONE' for all other cases. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of inputs from the final iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
