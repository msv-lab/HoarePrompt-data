Output State: **The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of three digits input by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The variable `t` will remain unchanged. The loop will have printed 'STAIR' for each set of inputs where `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' for each set where `b` is the maximum value, and 'NONE' for all other cases.**
