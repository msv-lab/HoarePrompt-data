Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the digits are in descending order (e.g., `3 2 1`). According to the problem description, this should output "NONE", but the program incorrectly outputs "PEAK" in such cases. For example, if the input is `3 2 1`, the program will output "PEAK" instead of "NONE".
