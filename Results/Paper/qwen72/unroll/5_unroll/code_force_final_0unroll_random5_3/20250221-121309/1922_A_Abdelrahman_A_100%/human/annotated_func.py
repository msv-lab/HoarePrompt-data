#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input (stdin) and output through standard output (stdout). The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings a, b, and c, followed by three lines containing the strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the loop reads three strings: `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if each character in `c` is not present in the corresponding position in `a` or `b`. If any character in `c` does not match the corresponding characters in `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the inner loop. If all characters in `c` match the corresponding characters in `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. The variables `slength`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `no` will be re-assigned for each iteration of the loop, and their final values after the loop will be those from the last test case. The variable `counter` will be reset to 0 for each test case and will end up being equal to the length of `c` if the loop does not break early. The value of `tests` will remain unchanged as `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a series of test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, the function checks if the string `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if each character in `c` is present in the corresponding position in either `a` or `b`. If any character in `c` is not found in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case. If all characters in `c` are found in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the results to standard output. The final state of the program is that the input has been fully processed, and the results for each test case have been printed.
