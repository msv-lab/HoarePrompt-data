Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a series of test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, the function checks if the string `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if each character in `c` is present in the corresponding position in either `a` or `b`. If any character in `c` is not found in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case. If all characters in `c` are found in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the results to standard output. The final state of the program is that the input has been fully processed, and the results for each test case have been printed. **
