You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2

    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a series of test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, the function checks if the string `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if each character in `c` is present in the corresponding position in either `a` or `b`. If any character in `c` is not found in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case. If all characters in `c` are found in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the results to standard output. The final state of the program is that the input has been fully processed, and the results for each test case have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it checks if a template exists such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program incorrectly checks if each character in `c` is not in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b` using the condition `if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]`. This condition is flawed because it checks if the character `x` from `c` is not equal to the characters at the same position in `a` and `b`, which is not the correct way to determine if a template exists.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
For this input, the program will output `NO` because it will check if `g` is not in `a[0]` and `b[0]`, which is true, and similarly for `h` and `i`. However, there exists a valid template `ABC` where all characters in `a` and `b` match the template, and `c` does not match the template. Therefore, the correct output should be `YES`.

The program fails to correctly handle cases where the characters in `a` and `b` are different, and the characters in `c` are different from both `a` and `b`. This is a clear violation of the problem description, making the program incorrect.
