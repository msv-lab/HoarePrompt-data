The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `tests`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tests`. If `tests` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so it doesn't need to be adjusted. For the loop to execute, `tests` must be greater than 0.

State: **`tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
