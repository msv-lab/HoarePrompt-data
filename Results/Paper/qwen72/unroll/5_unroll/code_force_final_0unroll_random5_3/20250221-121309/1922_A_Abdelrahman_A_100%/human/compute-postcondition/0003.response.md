The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from standard input (stdin), which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) indicating the length of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, followed by the strings themselves, each of which is exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function processes these test cases and outputs the results to standard output (stdout).

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. It processes these test cases and outputs the results to standard output.**
