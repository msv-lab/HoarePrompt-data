Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program only checks for a specific pattern where two consecutive friends are each other's best friends (i.e., `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`). This is a very limited check and does not account for all possible scenarios where at least two friends can be invited to the party.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Connected Components**: Each friend and their best friend form a connected component. We need to identify these components.
2. **Minimum Invitations**: For each component, we need to send invitations to all friends in the component to ensure that at least one friend in the component comes to the party. The goal is to find the smallest number of components that can cover at least two friends.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        visited = [False] * n
        min_invitations = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                # Start a new component
                component_size = 0
                current = i
                while not visited[current]:
                    visited[current] = True
                    component_size += 1
                    current = p[current] - 1
                
                # If the component size is 2, we only need to invite one friend from this component
                if component_size == 2:
                    min_invitations += 1
                else:
                    min_invitations += component_size
        
        # Ensure at least 2 friends come to the party
        if min_invitations < 2:
            min_invitations = 2
        
        print(min_invitations)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the number of friends and their best friends.
2. **Visited Array**: Use a `visited` array to keep track of which friends have been processed.
3. **Component Traversal**: For each friend, if they haven't been visited, start a new component and traverse through the friends in the component, marking them as visited.
4. **Component Size Handling**: If the component size is 2, we only need to invite one friend from this component. For larger components, we need to invite all friends in the component.
5. **Minimum Invitations**: Ensure that the total number of invitations is at least 2.

This approach correctly identifies the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least two friends come to the party.
