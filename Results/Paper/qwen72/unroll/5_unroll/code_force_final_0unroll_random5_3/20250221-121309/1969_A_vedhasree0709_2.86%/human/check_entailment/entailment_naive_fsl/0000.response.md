Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks for a very specific pattern where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`, which is not a general solution to the problem. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 4 5
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
3
2
```

Actual Output:
```
3
3
2
```

For the first test case, the program incorrectly prints `3` instead of `2`. The correct solution should be `2` because Monocarp can send invitations to friends `4` and `5`, and both will come to the party since they are each other's best friends. The program fails to identify this optimal solution.
