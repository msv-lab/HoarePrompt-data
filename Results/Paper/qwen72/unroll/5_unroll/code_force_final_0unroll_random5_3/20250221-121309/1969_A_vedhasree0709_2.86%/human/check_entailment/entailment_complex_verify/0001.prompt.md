You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers `p` of length `n` where each element `p_i` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all `p_i` are distinct) represents the best friend of the i-th friend. The function should be able to process these inputs to determine the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        i = 0
        
        j = 0
        
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        
        if j == 0:
            print(3)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop iterates through each test case. For each test case, it checks if there is a pair of friends (i, i+1) such that the best friend of the i-th friend is (i+2) and the best friend of the (i+1)-th friend is (i+1). If such a pair is found, it prints 2 and sets `j` to 1, breaking out of the loop. If no such pair is found, it prints 3. After processing all test cases, the loop finishes. The variables `n` and `l` are reset for each test case, and `i` and `j` are used within the loop for each test case but are reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the function having processed all test cases and printed the required output for each one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `l` of length `n` where each element `l[i]` (1 ≤ l[i] ≤ n, l[i] ≠ i, all `l[i]` are distinct) represents the best friend of the i-th friend. It checks if there is a pair of friends (i, i+1) such that the best friend of the i-th friend is (i+2) and the best friend of the (i+1)-th friend is (i+1). If such a pair is found, it prints 2. If no such pair is found, it prints 3. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program is reset for the next test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Monocarp wants to invite friends to a party such that at least 2 friends come.
   - A friend \( i \) will come if both \( i \) and \( p_i \) (the best friend of \( i \)) receive invitations.
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations to send to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends \( n \) and the list \( l \) of best friends.
   - It initializes two variables \( i \) and \( j \) to 0.
   - It then enters a loop where it checks if \( l[i] == i + 2 \) and \( l[i + 1] == i + 1 \).
     - If this condition is met, it prints 2 and sets \( j \) to 1, breaking out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a pair, it prints 3.

3. **Evaluating the Logic**:
   - The condition \( l[i] == i + 2 \) and \( l[i + 1] == i + 1 \) is checking for a specific pattern in the list \( l \).
   - This pattern implies that friend \( i + 1 \) and friend \( i + 2 \) are each other's best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, sending invitations to both \( i + 1 \) and \( i + 2 \) will ensure that both come to the party, hence the minimum number of invitations is 2.
   - If no such pair is found, the program prints 3, which is not always correct.

4. **Identifying the Flaw**:
   - The program only checks for a specific pattern and does not consider other possible scenarios where fewer than 3 invitations might be sufficient.
   - For example, in the case where \( p = [2, 1, 4, 3] \), the program will print 3, but the correct answer is 2 because sending invitations to friends 1 and 2 will ensure both come, and similarly for friends 3 and 4.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is not correct because it does not handle all possible scenarios and only checks for a specific pattern.

Correctness: **False**
