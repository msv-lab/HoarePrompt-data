### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `players` to store the positions of the players.
   - It initializes a dictionary `goals` to store the positions of the goals for each team.
   - It defines a dictionary `mouvements` to map the movement directions to their respective changes in coordinates.
   - It calculates the middle of the field and initializes the `quidditch` list to store the position of the Quaffle and the player carrying it.

2. **Field Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the field and populates the `players` and `goals` dictionaries.
   - It also sets the initial position of the Quaffle.

3. **Movement Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the movement of players using the `func_1` function.
   - It checks for collisions with the Bludger and prints the elimination event if a player is eliminated.
   - It updates the player's position and removes the eliminated player from the `players` dictionary.

4. **Catching the Quaffle:**
   - The program attempts to handle the catching of the Quaffle, but there is a logical error in the line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]`. This should be an assignment (`quidditch[1] = mo[0]`), not a comparison.

5. **Throwing the Quaffle:**
   - The program correctly handles the throwing of the Quaffle.
   - It checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score accordingly.
   - It prints the goal event and resets the Quaffle position to the middle of the field if a goal is scored.
   - However, the program incorrectly handles the case where a player throws the Quaffle at their own goal. It should award the point to the opposing team, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

6. **Final Score:**
   - The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

### Correctness:
- **False**

### Explanation of Errors:
- **Catching the Quaffle:**
  - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who catches the Quaffle.

- **Throwing the Quaffle:**
  - The program does not handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle at their own goal. It should award the point to the opposing team, but the current implementation does not do this.

### Corrected Program:
```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)

# Parse the field
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

# Process the moves
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if '.B' in players:
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                    if quidditch[1] == k:
                        quidditch = [v, '']
                    del players[k]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            else:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            else:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

### Final Correctness:
- **True** (after the corrections)
