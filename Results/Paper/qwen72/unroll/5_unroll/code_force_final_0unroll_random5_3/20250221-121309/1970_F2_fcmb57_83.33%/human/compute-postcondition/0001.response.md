Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of the field (3 <= a, b <= 99, a and b are odd), and the field contains goals, players, the Quaffle, and possibly a Bludger, with the constraints on the number of players and goals as described. A `TypeError` is raised because `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked.**
