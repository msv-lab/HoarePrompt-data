Output State: **The program returns the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, where `x` and `y` are the initial positions, and `dx` and `dy` are the changes in position. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`, the exact returned values cannot be determined.**
