Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of the field (3 <= a, b <= 99, a and b are odd), `x` is the first element of `a`, `y` is the second element of `a`, and the field contains goals, players, the Quaffle, and possibly a Bludger, with the constraints on the number of players and goals as described.**

However, since `a` is an integer, it cannot be unpacked into `x` and `y`. Therefore, the code will raise a `TypeError` because an integer is not iterable.
