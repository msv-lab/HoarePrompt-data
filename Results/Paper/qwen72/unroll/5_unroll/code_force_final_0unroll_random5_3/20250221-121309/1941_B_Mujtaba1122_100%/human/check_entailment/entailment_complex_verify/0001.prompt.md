You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

            return False

            print('no')

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop will either return False if any element in the list from index 0 to n-1 is non-zero, or it will complete all iterations without returning if all elements in this range are zero. The list and n remain unchanged.
    return True
    #The program returns True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `list` and a non-negative integer `n` where `0 <= n <= len(list)`. It checks if all elements in the list from index 0 to n-1 are zero. If any element in this range is non-zero, the function returns `False`. If all elements in this range are zero, the function returns `True`. The list and the value of `n` remain unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list).
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: list[i - 1] is 0 for all i in the range 1 to n - 2, list[i] is 1 or less for all i in the range 1 to n - 2, and list[i + 1] is reduced by the cumulative value of list[i - 1] for all i in the range 1 to n - 2.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: list[i - 1] is 0 for all i in the range 1 to n - 2, list[i] is 1 or less for all i in the range 1 to n - 2, and list[i + 1] is reduced by the cumulative value of list[i - 1] for all i in the range 1 to n - 2. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= len(list). It modifies the list such that for each index `i` in the range 1 to n-2, the elements at `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` are reduced based on the values of `list[i-1]` and the conditions specified. If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, the function prints 'no' and returns `None`. If the function completes the loop without early termination, it calls `func_1(list, n)`. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function prints 'YES' and returns `True`; otherwise, it prints 'NO' and returns `False`. The final state of the list is such that `list[i-1]` is 0 for all `i` in the range 1 to n-2, `list[i]` is 1 or less for all `i` in the range 1 to n-2, and `list[i+1]` is reduced by the cumulative value of `list[i-1]` for all `i` in the range 1 to n-2.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` and need to determine if we can make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation allows us to choose an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) and decrement `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - It iterates through the array and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct and serves its purpose well.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the array to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation as long as `a[i] > 1`, `a[i-1] > 0`, and `a[i+1] > 0`.
   - The operation is applied by decrementing `a[i+1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i-1]` by `1 * a[i-1]`, `2 * a[i-1]`, and `1 * a[i-1]` respectively.
   - If at any point `a[i-1]` becomes non-zero, it prints 'no' and returns.
   - After attempting to apply the operations, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

4. **Issues with the Program:**
   - **Incorrect Operation Application:**
     - The operation is applied incorrectly. The code decrements `a[i+1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i-1]` by `1 * a[i-1]`, `2 * a[i-1]`, and `1 * a[i-1]` respectively.
     - This means it is decrementing `a[i+1]` and `a[i-1]` by the value of `a[i-1]`, which is not the correct operation. The correct operation should decrement `a[i+1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i-1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - **Early Termination:**
     - The function prints 'no' and returns if `a[i-1]` becomes non-zero after the operation, which is not the correct condition to check. The correct condition should be to check if `a[i-1]` or `a[i+1]` becomes negative, as this would indicate that the operation cannot be applied without making the array invalid.
   - **Final Check:**
     - The final check using `func_1` is correct, but the function should return 'YES' or 'NO' directly instead of printing it. The problem description specifies that the output should be printed, but the function should return the result to be printed in the main part of the program.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that the operation is applied correctly and that we check for the possibility of making all elements zero without making any element negative.
   - We should also handle the edge cases where the array is already zero or where it is impossible to make all elements zero.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program has issues with the operation application and the conditions for early termination, which make it incorrect for the given problem.
