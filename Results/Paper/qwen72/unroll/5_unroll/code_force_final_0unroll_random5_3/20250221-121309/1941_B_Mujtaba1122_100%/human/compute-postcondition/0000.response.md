The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the range defined by `range(1, n - 1)`. To ensure the loop executes, the range must contain at least one value. This means `n - 1` must be greater than 1, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 2.

Given the initial state:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list).

We need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list), `i` is 1**
