To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the given code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list).

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
        list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
        list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    if list[i - 1] != 0:
        print('no')
        return
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The outer loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, the inner `while` loop runs as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0`.

2. **Inner Loop Operations**:
   - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`: Decreases `list[i + 1]` by the value of `list[i - 1]`.
   - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`: Decreases `list[i]` by twice the value of `list[i - 1]`.
   - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`: Decreases `list[i - 1]` by its own value, effectively setting it to 0.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - After the inner loop, if `list[i - 1]` is not 0, the function prints 'no' and returns immediately.

### Output State:
- The loop will continue to execute until either:
  - `list[i]` is 1 or less.
  - `list[i - 1]` is 0.
  - `list[i + 1]` is 0.
- If at any point `list[i - 1]` is not 0 after the inner loop, the function will print 'no' and return.

### Final Output State:
- The elements of `list` from index 1 to `n - 2` will be modified such that:
  - `list[i]` will be 1 or less for all `i` in the range.
  - `list[i - 1]` will be 0 for all `i` in the range.
  - `list[i + 1]` will be reduced by the cumulative value of `list[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range.
- If the function does not return early, the loop will complete all iterations.

### Natural Language Description:
- The loop will modify the list such that for each index `i` from 1 to `n - 2`:
  - `list[i - 1]` will be set to 0.
  - `list[i]` will be reduced to 1 or less.
  - `list[i + 1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i - 1]` before it was set to 0.
- If at any point `list[i - 1]` is not 0 after the inner loop, the function will print 'no' and return.

Output State: **list[i - 1] is 0 for all i in the range 1 to n - 2, list[i] is 1 or less for all i in the range 1 to n - 2, and list[i + 1] is reduced by the cumulative value of list[i - 1] for all i in the range 1 to n - 2.**
