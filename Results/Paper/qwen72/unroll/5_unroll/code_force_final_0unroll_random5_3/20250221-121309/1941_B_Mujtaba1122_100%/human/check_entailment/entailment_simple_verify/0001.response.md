### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) and decrement `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - It iterates through the array and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct and serves its purpose well.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the array to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation as long as `a[i] > 1`, `a[i-1] > 0`, and `a[i+1] > 0`.
   - The operation is applied by decrementing `a[i+1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i-1]` by `1 * a[i-1]`, `2 * a[i-1]`, and `1 * a[i-1]` respectively.
   - This is incorrect because the operation should decrement `a[i+1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i-1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by `1 * a[i-1]`, `2 * a[i-1]`, and `1 * a[i-1]`.

4. **Issues with the Program:**
   - **Incorrect Operation Application:**
     - The operation is applied incorrectly. The code decrements `a[i+1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i-1]` by `1 * a[i-1]`, `2 * a[i-1]`, and `1 * a[i-1]` respectively, which is not the correct operation. The correct operation should decrement `a[i+1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i-1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - **Early Termination:**
     - The function prints 'no' and returns if `a[i-1]` becomes non-zero after the operation, which is not the correct condition to check. The correct condition should be to check if `a[i-1]` or `a[i+1]` becomes negative, as this would indicate that the operation cannot be applied without making the array invalid.
   - **Final Check:**
     - The final check using `func_1` is correct, but the function should return 'YES' or 'NO' directly instead of printing it. The problem description specifies that the output should be printed, but the function should return the result to be printed in the main part of the program.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that the operation is applied correctly and that we check for the possibility of making all elements zero without making any element negative.
   - We should also handle the edge cases where the array is already zero or where it is impossible to make all elements zero.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program has issues with the operation application and the conditions for early termination, which make it incorrect for the given problem.

Final: **False**
