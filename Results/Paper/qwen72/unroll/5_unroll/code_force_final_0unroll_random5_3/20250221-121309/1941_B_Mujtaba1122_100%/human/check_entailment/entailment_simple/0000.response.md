### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If it completes the iteration without returning `False`, it returns `True`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list to zero using the described operations.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to index `n-2` (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - The operation reduces `list[i-1]` by 1, `list[i]` by 2, and `list[i+1]` by 1.
   - If at any point `list[i-1]` becomes zero, it prints "no" and returns, indicating that it is impossible to make all elements zero.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The operation inside the `while` loop is incorrect. It should reduce `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the current implementation uses `list[i-1]` as a multiplier, which is incorrect.
   - The condition `if list[i-1] != 0` should be `if list[i] != 0` or a similar check to ensure that the operation can still be applied.
   - The program does not handle the edge cases where the list might already be zero or where the operation cannot be applied due to the constraints of the problem.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should reduce `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - The program should also check if the operation can be applied and handle cases where the list cannot be reduced to zero.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because the operation inside the `while` loop is flawed, and the condition to check if the operation can be applied is incorrect. Additionally, the program does not handle edge cases properly.
