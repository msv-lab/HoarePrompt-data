### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and decrementing `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1, respectively.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(list, n)`:**
     - This function checks if all elements in the list from index 0 to `n-1` are zero.
     - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero, otherwise `True`.
     - This function is correct and serves its purpose of verifying if the array is all zeros.

   - **`func_2(list, n)`:**
     - This function attempts to apply the operation to the list to make all elements zero.
     - It iterates through the list from index 1 to `n-2` and applies the operation as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
     - The operation is applied by decrementing `list[i+1]` by `list[i-1]`, `list[i]` by `2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1]` by `list[i-1]`.
     - If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, it prints 'no' and returns `None`.
     - After the loop, it calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if the list is all zeros.
     - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Logical Flow:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly applies the operation to the list.
   - The condition `list[i] > 1` ensures that the operation can be applied without making any element negative.
   - The condition `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0` ensures that the elements being decremented are positive.
   - However, the function `func_2` has a logical flaw in the way it applies the operation. Specifically, the line `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` and `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` and `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` should be simplified to `list[i + 1] -= 1`, `list[i] -= 2`, and `list[i - 1] -= 1` to match the problem's operation.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly apply the operation as described in the problem. It incorrectly multiplies the decrement values by `list[i-1]`, which can lead to incorrect results.
   - For example, if `list[i-1]` is 3, the function will decrement `list[i+1]` by 3, `list[i]` by 6, and `list[i-1]` by 3, which is not the intended operation.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the operation in `func_2`. The operation should decrement `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1, respectively, without multiplying by `list[i-1]`.

**Correctness: **False****
