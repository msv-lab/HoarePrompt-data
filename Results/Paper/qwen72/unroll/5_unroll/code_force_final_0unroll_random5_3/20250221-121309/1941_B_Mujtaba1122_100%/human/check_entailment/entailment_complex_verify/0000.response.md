### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Operation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the operation in `func_2` is not correctly implemented. The operation should subtract 1 from `list[i-1]`, 2 from `list[i]`, and 1 from `list[i+1]`. However, the current implementation uses `list[i-1]` as a multiplier, which is incorrect. This means that the program does not perform the required operation as specified in the problem description.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be zero. For example, if the input array is `[0, 0, 0]`, the program should immediately return "YES" without performing any operations. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario.
   - Additionally, the program does not handle cases where the array has elements that cannot be reduced to zero using the given operation. For example, if the input array is `[1, 1, 1]`, it is impossible to make all elements zero using the operation, but the program does not correctly identify this.

3. **Infinite Loop Potential**:
   - The `while` loop in `func_2` can potentially lead to an infinite loop if the conditions are not met correctly. For example, if `list[i]` is 1 and `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are both greater than 0, the loop will never terminate because `list[i]` will never be greater than 1.

4. **Incorrect Output Format**:
   - The program prints "no" directly, which is not one of the accepted outputs ("YES" or "NO"). This is a significant issue because the output format is strictly defined in the problem description.

5. **Incorrect Final Check**:
   - The final check in `func_2` uses `func_1` to verify if all elements are zero, but it does not handle the case where the array might not be zero after the operations. For example, if the input array is `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`, the program should correctly output "YES" after performing the operations, but it incorrectly prints "no" and "NO".

### Test Case Analysis:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  5
  1 3 5 5 2
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  YES
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  no
  NO
  ```
- **Explanation:**
  - The program incorrectly prints "no" and "NO" instead of "YES" for this valid input. This is because the operation is not correctly implemented, and the program does not handle the case where the array can be reduced to zero.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues identified in the original assessment and the test case analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
