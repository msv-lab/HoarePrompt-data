The function `solve` is expected to be called multiple times, each time with a set of inputs that include an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4. For each test case, the inputs are two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9), followed by two lists of integers `a` and `x` of length `n`, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n with x_i ≠ 0. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
