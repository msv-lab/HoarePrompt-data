The provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should accept parameters to handle the input as described. Here is the correct function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def can_survive(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing (n, k, a, x) where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and x is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
