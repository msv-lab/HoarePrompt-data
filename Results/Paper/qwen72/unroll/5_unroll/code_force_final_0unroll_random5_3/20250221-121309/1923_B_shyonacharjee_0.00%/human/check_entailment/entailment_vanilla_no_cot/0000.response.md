Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it calculates whether the player can survive and kill all the monsters. Specifically, the condition `if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:` is incorrect. The correct condition should check if the number of bullets needed to kill the current monster exceeds the number of bullets that can be fired in the available time, considering the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second (`k`).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
        success = True
        for (position, health) in monsters:
            distance = abs(position)
            time_available = distance
            bullets_needed = health
            if bullets_needed > time_available * k:
                success = False
                break
        print('YES' if success else 'NO')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

### Explanation:
- **Sorting the Monsters**: The monsters are sorted based on their distance from the player (`abs(position)`), which is correct because the player needs to prioritize killing the monsters that are closer.
- **Checking Feasibility**: The condition `if bullets_needed > time_available * k:` checks if the health of the current monster is greater than the number of bullets that can be fired in the available time (`distance * k`). If this condition is true, it means the player cannot kill the monster before it reaches the player, and the player will lose.

This corrected program should now correctly determine if the player can survive and kill all the monsters.
