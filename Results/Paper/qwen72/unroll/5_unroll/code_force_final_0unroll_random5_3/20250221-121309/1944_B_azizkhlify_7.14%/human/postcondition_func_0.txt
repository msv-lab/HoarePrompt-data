The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and an array `a` of length `2n` containing each integer from 1 to `n` exactly twice. For each test case, it prints pairs or single elements from `a` based on specific conditions. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the output for each test case will be the elements printed according to the conditions specified within the function.
