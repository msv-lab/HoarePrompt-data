It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. The function described in the problem is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`, not `func_1()`. Let's correct that and provide the precondition based on the actual function and problem description.

Problem description: The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` is designed to generate Python files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in subfolders of the current directory, where the subfolder names are within a specified range of integers.

Function definition:
```python
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers, with start <= end. The current directory contains subfolders, and some of these subfolders are named with digits. Each subfolder may contain `.html` files.**
