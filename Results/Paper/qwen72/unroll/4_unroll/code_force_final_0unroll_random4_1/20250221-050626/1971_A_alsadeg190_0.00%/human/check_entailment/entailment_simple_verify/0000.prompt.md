You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that processes t test cases, where t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `x` times, where `x` is the input integer for each test case. During each iteration, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on user input. If `x` is greater than `y`, the loop will print `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it will print `y` followed by `x`. After all iterations, the values of `x` and `y` will be the last values input by the user, and the loop will have printed the results for each iteration. The variable `i` will be equal to `x - 1` at the end of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` correctly. Specifically, in the `if x > y` block, it prints `x, y` instead of `y, x`, and in the `else` block, it prints `y, x` instead of `x, y`. This means that the program will always print the larger number first, which is the opposite of what the problem description requires.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
1 9
```
The program will output:
```
9 1
```
Instead of the correct output:
```
1 9
```
