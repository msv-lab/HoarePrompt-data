The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, where `1 <= m, k <= n <= 50`. The function then checks if either `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` holds true. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes its execution. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are not modified during the function's execution.
