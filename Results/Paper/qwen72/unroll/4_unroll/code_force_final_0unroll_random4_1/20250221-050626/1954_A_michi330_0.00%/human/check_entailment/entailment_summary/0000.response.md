Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints the ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Win:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color regardless of how Alice paints them.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, this means that even if Alice paints the ribbon in the most diverse way possible (i.e., using as many different colors as possible), Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Win:**
   - Alice wins if neither of the above conditions hold true. Specifically, if `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`.

4. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then checks the conditions:
     - `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:`
       - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:** `n = 1, m = 1, k = 1`
     - `n <= k` is true, so it prints 'NO'.
   - **Example 2:** `n = 5, m = 1, k = 1`
     - `n <= k` is false, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true (5 - 5 < 1), so it prints 'NO'.
   - **Example 3:** `n = 5, m = 2, k = 1`
     - `n <= k` is false, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k` is true (5 - 3 >= 1), so it prints 'YES'.
   - **Example 4:** `n = 5, m = 2, k = 2`
     - `n <= k` is false, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true (5 - 3 < 2), so it prints 'NO'.
   - **Example 5:** `n = 5, m = 5, k = 3`
     - `n <= k` is false, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k` is true (5 - 1 >= 3), so it prints 'YES'.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The conditions and the logic are sound and match the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
