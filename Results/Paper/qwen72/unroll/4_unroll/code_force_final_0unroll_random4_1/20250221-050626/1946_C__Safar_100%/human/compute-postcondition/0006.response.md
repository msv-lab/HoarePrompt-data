To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `l <= r`. The variables `l` and `r` are the only ones that can be adjusted to meet this condition.

Given the initial state:
- `l` is 1
- `r` is `n // k`

For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Since `l` is already 1, we need to ensure that `r` is at least 1. This means `n // k` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Let's break it down:
- `n // k` is the integer division of `n` by `k`.
- For `n // k` to be at least 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least `k`.

State: **`g` is a list of lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i` in the tree. The lengths of the lists in `g` correspond to the degrees of the nodes in the tree. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, but `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`. `c` is 0. `l` is 1. `r` is `n // k`**
