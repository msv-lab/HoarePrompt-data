The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop depends on the input provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be at least 1. The state of `t`, `n`, and `p` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, the input must be consistent with the state of `t` since `t` represents the number of test cases.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `p` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `_` is 0, and the input must be an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `t`**
