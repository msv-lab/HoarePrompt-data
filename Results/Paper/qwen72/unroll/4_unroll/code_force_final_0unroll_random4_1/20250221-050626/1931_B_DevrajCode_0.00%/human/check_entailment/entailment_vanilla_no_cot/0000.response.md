Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list. However, it does not handle multiple test cases correctly. The first line of the input should be the number of test cases, and each test case should be processed separately.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with `n` and `a` as arguments, but `a` is a flattened list of all numbers in the input, not just the numbers for a single test case.

3. **Logic Error**: The logic inside `func_1` is incorrect. The program checks if the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount ever goes below zero. This is not the correct way to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water. The correct approach would be to check if the water can be redistributed such that the sum of the differences between the current amounts and the target amount is zero.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the number of containers and the amounts of water.
3. Calculate the target amount of water each container should have.
4. Check if it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the target amount.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

t = int(data[0])
index = 1
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    print(func_1(n, a))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list `data`.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: It processes each test case by reading the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water `a` for that test case.
3. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the correct `n` and `a` for each test case.
4. **Logic**: The function `func_1` calculates the target amount of water each container should have and checks if it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the target amount. If at any point the cumulative difference goes below zero, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
