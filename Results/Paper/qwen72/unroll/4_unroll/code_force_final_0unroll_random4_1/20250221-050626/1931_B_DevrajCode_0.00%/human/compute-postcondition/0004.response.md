Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n. `total_water` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water % n` is equal to 0, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`.**

The variable `target` is assigned the value of `total_water` divided by `n` using integer division. Since `total_water` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` and `total_water % n` is 0, `target` is an integer representing the average value of the elements in `a`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
