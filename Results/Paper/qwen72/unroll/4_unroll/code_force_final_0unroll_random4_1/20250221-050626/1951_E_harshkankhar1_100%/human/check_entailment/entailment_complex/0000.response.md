### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse `s[::-1]`.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads a string `s` from user input and determines if it can be partitioned into substrings where none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - **Initial Check**:
     - If `s` is already a non-palindrome, it prints "YES", "1", and the original string `s`.
     - This is correct because a non-palindromic string can be partitioned into a single part that is itself.
   - **Finding the First Non-Matching Character**:
     - The function iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character (`s[0]`).
     - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it means all characters in `s` are the same, making `s` a palindrome. In this case, it prints "NO".
     - This is correct because a string with all identical characters is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - **Partitioning the String**:
     - If a non-matching character is found (`x != -1`), the function checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", "2", and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - This is correct because `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` are both non-palindromic.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`.
       - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO".
       - This is incorrect because it does not handle all cases where `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome. For example, if `s` is "aabbcc" and `x` is 1, the function will incorrectly print "NO" even though a valid partition exists (e.g., "aa" and "bbcc").
       - If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, it prints "YES", "2", and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
       - This is correct because `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` are both non-palindromic in this case.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_2` has a logical error in the condition where it prints "NO" if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`. This condition is too restrictive and does not correctly handle all cases where a valid partition exists. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
