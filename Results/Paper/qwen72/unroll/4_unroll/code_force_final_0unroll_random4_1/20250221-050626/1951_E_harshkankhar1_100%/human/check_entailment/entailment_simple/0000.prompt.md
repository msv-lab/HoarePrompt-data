Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.

    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), otherwise it returns False.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and n is the length of s such that 1 <= n <= 10^6.
def func_2():
    s = input()

    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` if such a character exists, otherwise `x` remains -1.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *`s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: aaab bbccc
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: - The `print` statement will always print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.
            #
            #Therefore, based on the given precondition and the code snippet, the output will be:
            #
            #Output:
        else :
            print('YES')

            #This is printed: [s[:x + 2]] [s[x + 2:]] (where [s[:x + 2]] is the substring of `s` from the start up to and including the character at index `x + 1`, and [s[x + 2:]] is the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end)
        #State: `s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1, and the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`. Additionally, if `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, this condition is retained. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
    #State: *`s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, and `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy the condition. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies the condition, and if `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, this condition is retained. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
