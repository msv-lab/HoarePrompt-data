To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1.
   - The result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`.
   - `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.

2. **Code to Analyze:**
   ```python
   print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `s[:x + 2]` will print the substring of `s` from the start up to and including the character at index `x + 1`.
   - `s[x + 2:]` will print the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of the string.
   - The `print` statement will concatenate these two substrings with a space in between.

4. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `s` is the user input string.
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
   - `x + 2` is the index up to which the first substring is taken, and the starting index for the second substring.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - The first part of the output, `s[:x + 2]`, will include the characters from the start of the string up to and including the character at index `x + 1`.
   - The second part of the output, `s[x + 2:]`, will include the characters from index `x + 2` to the end of the string.
   - The space in the `print` statement will separate these two substrings.

Given the initial state, we can conclude that the output will be the first part of the string up to and including the character at index `x + 1`, followed by a space, and then the rest of the string starting from index `x + 2`.

Output: **[s[:x + 2]] [s[x + 2:]] (where [s[:x + 2]] is the substring of `s` from the start up to and including the character at index `x + 1`, and [s[x + 2:]] is the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end)**
