You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings of length n, representing the two rows of a 2 × n grid. The function should process these inputs to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. The total number of test cases, t, is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    input = sys.stdin.readline

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())

    #State: The loop will have processed all test cases, printing the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i`, `work`, and `counter` will have been reset or updated as necessary for each iteration, but their final values after the loop will be undefined as they are local to each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it computes and prints the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by traversing the grid represented by the two strings, and the number of distinct paths that yield this smallest string. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is undefined for the variables used within the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the way the program determines the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string is not always correct.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0101
0000
```
The expected output should be:
```
00000
4
```
However, the program will output:
```
01000
2
```

### Explanation of the Failure:
1. **Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - The program constructs the lexicographically smallest string by always preferring the top row (string `a`) unless it encounters a situation where the bottom row (string `b`) has a smaller value. This approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible paths that could yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - In the example input, the correct lexicographically smallest string is `00000`, which can be achieved by taking the path `a[0] -> b[0] -> b[1] -> b[2] -> b[3] -> b[4]` or any other path that stays in the bottom row after the first step.

2. **Number of Paths**:
   - The program's method for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is also incorrect. It increments the counter based on the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, which does not account for all possible valid paths.
   - In the example input, there are 4 valid paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string `00000`:
     - `a[0] -> b[0] -> b[1] -> b[2] -> b[3] -> b[4]`
     - `a[0] -> a[1] -> b[1] -> b[2] -> b[3] -> b[4]`
     - `a[0] -> a[1] -> a[2] -> b[2] -> b[3] -> b[4]`
     - `a[0] -> a[1] -> a[2] -> a[3] -> b[3] -> b[4]`

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and it is incorrect.
