Reasoning:

1. **Lexicographically Smallest String Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the grid columns from left to right.
   - It starts by adding the top row's value to the result string `ans`.
   - If the next value in the bottom row is smaller than the next value in the top row, it switches to the bottom row and continues from there.
   - This approach ensures that the program always chooses the smallest possible value at each step, which is necessary to form the lexicographically smallest string.

2. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program initializes a counter to 1, representing the initial path.
   - It then iterates through the grid columns to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - The counter is incremented when the current value in the top row matches the next value in the bottom row, indicating that the grasshopper can switch rows at that point without changing the string.
   - If the grasshopper encounters a point where it cannot switch rows (i.e., the next value in the top row is '0' and the current value in the bottom row is '1'), the counter is reset to 1 and the loop breaks.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the grid has only one column correctly by adding the bottom row's value to the result string.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the grid has more than one column and the grasshopper can switch rows at the last column.

4. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases as required.
   - It prints the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths for each test case, which matches the problem's output requirements.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program processes each test case in linear time relative to the length of the strings, which is efficient given the constraints.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
