#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings of length n, representing the two rows of a 2 × n grid. The function should process these inputs to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. The total number of test cases, t, is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        ans = ''
        
        i = 0
        
        work = True
        
        while i < len(a):
            if work:
                ans += a[i]
                if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                    work = False
                elif i + 1 == len(a):
                    ans += b[i]
                    break
                else:
                    i += 1
            else:
                ans += b[i]
                i += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
        counter = 1
        
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(counter)
        
    #State: The loop will have processed all test cases, printing the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i`, `work`, and `counter` will have been reset or updated as necessary for each iteration, but their final values after the loop will be undefined as they are local to each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it computes and prints the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by traversing the grid represented by the two strings, and the number of distinct paths that yield this smallest string. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is undefined for the variables used within the function.
