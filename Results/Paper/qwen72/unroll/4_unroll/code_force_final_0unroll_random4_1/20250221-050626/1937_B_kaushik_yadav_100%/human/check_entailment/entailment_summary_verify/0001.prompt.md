You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it computes and prints the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by traversing the grid represented by the two strings, and the number of distinct paths that yield this smallest string. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is undefined for the variables used within the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, the binary string `a` (top row), and the binary string `b` (bottom row).

2. **Building the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It uses a boolean variable `work` to decide whether to take the next character from `a` or `b`.
   - The loop iterates through the characters of `a` and `b`:
     - If `work` is `True`, it appends the current character from `a` to `ans`.
     - If the next character in `b` is lexicographically smaller than the next character in `a`, it switches to taking characters from `b` (sets `work` to `False`).
     - If the loop reaches the end of `a`, it appends the last character from `b` and breaks the loop.
     - If `work` is `False`, it appends the current character from `b` to `ans` and increments the index `i`.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program initializes a counter `counter` to 1, representing the initial path.
   - It then iterates through the characters of `a` and `b` to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string:
     - If the next character in `a` is the same as the current character in `b`, it increments the counter.
     - If the next character in `a` is '0' and the current character in `b` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
     - If the characters differ and the next character in `a` is not '0' and the current character in `b` is not '1', it breaks the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `ans` and the number of paths `counter`.

### Analysis:

- **Lexicographically Smallest String:**
  - The program correctly builds the lexicographically smallest string by always choosing the smaller character between `a` and `b` at each step.
  - The logic for switching between `a` and `b` is correct, ensuring that the smallest possible string is formed.

- **Number of Paths:**
  - The program correctly counts the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
  - The counter is incremented only when the next character in `a` is the same as the current character in `b`, which is a valid condition for multiple paths.
  - The counter is reset when the next character in `a` is '0' and the current character in `b` is '1', which ensures that the count is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It builds the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string. The logic and implementation are sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
