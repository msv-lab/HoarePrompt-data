### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to pick elements from an array `a` and manipulate an array `c`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to `c` and removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes the chosen element from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score is the MEX of `c`.
   - Alice aims to maximize the score, and Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will try to include the smallest possible integers in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest possible integers in `c` to minimize the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `n` to find the MEX of `c`.

4. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - **Counter Usage:** The `Counter` is used to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`. This is correct because it helps in determining which elements are present and how many times.
   - **First Variable:** The variable `first` is used to track if Alice has encountered a unique element (i.e., an element that appears exactly once in `arr`).
   - **MEX Calculation:**
     - The program iterates through the range from 0 to `n` to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in `arr` (i.e., `i not in mpp.keys()`).
     - If such an `i` is found, it is printed as the MEX and the loop breaks.
     - If `i` is in `arr` and appears exactly once, and `first` is `True`, it means Bob has already removed the unique element, so Alice cannot include it in `c`. In this case, `i` is printed as the MEX and the loop breaks.
     - If `i` is in `arr` and appears exactly once, and `first` is `False`, it means Alice will include this element in `c` on her first turn, and `first` is set to `True`.

5. **Verification:**
   - **Case 1: All elements are repeated.**
     - Example: `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
     - The program will find that 2 is the smallest integer not in `arr` and print 2.
     - This is correct because Alice and Bob can only pick repeated elements, and the MEX of `c` will be 2.
   - **Case 2: All elements are unique.**
     - Example: `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
     - The program will find that 4 is the smallest integer not in `arr` and print 4.
     - This is incorrect because Bob can always remove the smallest unique element, and Alice will be forced to pick the next smallest unique element, resulting in a MEX of 1.
   - **Case 3: Mixed elements (some unique, some repeated).**
     - Example: `arr = [0, 1, 1, 2]`
     - The program will find that 3 is the smallest integer not in `arr` and print 3.
     - This is incorrect because Bob can remove the unique element 0, and Alice will be forced to pick 1, resulting in a MEX of 2.

6. **Flaws in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where Bob can remove the smallest unique element to minimize the MEX.
   - The logic for determining the MEX is flawed because it does not consider the optimal moves of both players.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect in its logic and implementation. It does not correctly calculate the MEX of `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
