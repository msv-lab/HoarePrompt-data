Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user. It then checks the relationship between these digits and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the integer `q` and the digits `a`, `b`, and `c` are no longer relevant, and the program state is unchanged except for the output printed to the console. **
