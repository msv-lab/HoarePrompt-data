You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, a, b, and c are digits where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, q is an input integer, mn is 100.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` from the input.
   - It then iterates `q` times to process each test case.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
   - It checks if the digits form a stair using the condition `a < b < c`.
   - It checks if the digits form a peak using the condition `a < b > c`.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, it prints "NONE".

3. **Conditions:**
   - The condition `a < b < c` correctly identifies a stair.
   - The condition `a < b > c` correctly identifies a peak.
   - However, the `else` block is only executed if the second condition (`a < b > c`) is not satisfied. This means that if `a < b < c` is true, the program will print "STAIR" and then check the second condition, which will not be true, and thus will not print "NONE" or "PEAK" again. This is a logical error because the `else` block should only be executed if both conditions are false.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints "STAIR" for a stair and "PEAK" for a peak.
   - However, it may incorrectly print "NONE" for cases where `a < b < c` is true but `a < b > c` is false, due to the placement of the `else` block.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical error in the placement of the `else` block. It should be placed outside the second `if` statement to ensure that "NONE" is only printed if neither condition is satisfied.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program is incorrect due to the logical error in the placement of the `else` block.
