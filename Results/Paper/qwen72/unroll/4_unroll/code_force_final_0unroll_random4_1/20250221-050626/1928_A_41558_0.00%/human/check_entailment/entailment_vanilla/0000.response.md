### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The first condition checks if both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If both are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, as any cut will result in non-integer dimensions. Therefore, the program correctly prints "NO" in this case.
   - The second condition checks if either `a` or `b` is exactly half of the other (`a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`). This condition is intended to check if the rectangle can only be cut into two identical smaller rectangles, which would not form a different rectangle when recombined. However, this condition is incorrect because it should check if the rectangle can be cut into two identical smaller rectangles, which would mean `a == 2 * b` or `b == 2 * a`. The current condition `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is not equivalent to this and can lead to false negatives.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "YES", indicating that Bob can form a different rectangle.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "NO" or "YES" for each test case, which matches the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
- The program is mostly correct but has a logical error in the second condition. The condition `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` should be replaced with `a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a` to correctly identify when the rectangle can only be cut into two identical smaller rectangles.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
