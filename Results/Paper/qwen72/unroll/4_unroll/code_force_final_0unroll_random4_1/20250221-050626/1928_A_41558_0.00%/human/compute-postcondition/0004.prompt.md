You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `n` times, and for each iteration, it has read two integers `a` and `b` from the input. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it has printed either 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd or if one of them is exactly half of the other, or 'YES' otherwise. The values of `a` and `b` are updated in each iteration, but their final values are not retained after the loop completes. The variable `n` is unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of a rectangle, and handles multiple test cases specified by an integer `t`. For each test case, it returns a result based on the dimensions `a` and `b`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
