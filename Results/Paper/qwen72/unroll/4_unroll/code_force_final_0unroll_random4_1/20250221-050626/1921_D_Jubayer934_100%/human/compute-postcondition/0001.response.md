Output State: **The loop reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, two lists `a` and `b` of integers, and prints the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all `t` test cases have been processed. The final state of these variables is undefined as they are re-initialized for each test case. The variable `ans` contains the list of absolute differences for the last test case, and `temp` is an integer that indicates the index where the algorithm decided to switch the pairing strategy, or -1 if no switch was needed.**
