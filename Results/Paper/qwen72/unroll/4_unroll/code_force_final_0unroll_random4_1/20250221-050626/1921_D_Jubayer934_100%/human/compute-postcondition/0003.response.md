Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` using a specific pairing strategy. The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each one, printing the sum of the minimum absolute differences for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` is undefined as they are re-initialized for each test case. The variable `ans` contains the list of absolute differences for the last test case, and `temp` is an integer that indicates the index where the algorithm decided to switch the pairing strategy, or -1 if no switch was needed. **
