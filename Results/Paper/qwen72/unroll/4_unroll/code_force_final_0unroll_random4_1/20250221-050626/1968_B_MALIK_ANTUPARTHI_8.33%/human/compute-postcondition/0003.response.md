The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, the integers `n` and `m` are such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the binary strings `a` and `b` are of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the binary strings `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. It returns a result for each test case based on the binary strings `a` and `b`.**
