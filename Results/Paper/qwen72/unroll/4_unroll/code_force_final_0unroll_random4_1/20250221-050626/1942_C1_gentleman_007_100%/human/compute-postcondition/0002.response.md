Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer such that `num` >= 2; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all of which are `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all of which are `0`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all of which are `0`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `Lowest_Prime` with `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`. The other variables, `num`, `prime`, and `Highest_Prime`, remain unchanged.
