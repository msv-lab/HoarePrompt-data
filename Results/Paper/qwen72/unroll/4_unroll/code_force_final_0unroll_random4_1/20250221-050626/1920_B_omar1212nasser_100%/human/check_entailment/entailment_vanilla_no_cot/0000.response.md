Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly handle the game's rules, particularly the optimal play by both Alice and Bob. Here are the issues:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array is sorted in `func_1`, which is a good start, but the logic in `func_2` does not correctly account for the removal and negation steps.

2. **Negation Logic:**
   - The program attempts to minimize the sum by negating the largest elements, but this is not always the optimal strategy. Bob should negate the smallest elements (in absolute value) to minimize the sum, and Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.

3. **Removal Logic:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the removal of elements by Alice. Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum, but the current logic does not ensure this.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the number of elements to be removed or negated is equal to the length of the array.

To correct the program, we need to ensure that Alice removes the smallest elements and Bob negates the smallest elements (in absolute value) from the remaining array. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        result = func_2(k, x, a)
        print(result)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    # Alice removes the smallest k elements
    elements = elements[removals:]
    
    # Count the number of negative elements
    neg_count = sum(1 for e in elements if e < 0)
    
    # If there are more negative elements than Bob can negate, negate the smallest ones
    if neg_count > negatives:
        elements.sort(key=lambda x: abs(x))
        for i in range(negatives):
            elements[i] = -elements[i]
    else:
        # Negate all negative elements
        for i in range(neg_count):
            elements[i] = -elements[i]
        # If Bob has more negations left, negate the smallest positive element if it will help
        if (negatives - neg_count) % 2 == 1:
            elements.sort()
            elements[0] = -elements[0]
    
    # Return the sum of the modified array
    return sum(elements)

# Example usage
# func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that Alice removes the smallest elements and Bob negates the smallest elements (in absolute value) to achieve the optimal sum.
