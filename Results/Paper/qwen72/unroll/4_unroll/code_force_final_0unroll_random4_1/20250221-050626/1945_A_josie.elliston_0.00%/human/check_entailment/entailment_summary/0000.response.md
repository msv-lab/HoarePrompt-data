### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each introvert needs a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (1, 2, or 3).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents to make them complete.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0` and `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it returns `None` because it's impossible to satisfy the extroverts' requirement.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3, which is the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all extroverts and universals.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`.

4. **Verification with Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1: (1, 2, 3)**
     - `func_1(2, 3)` returns 2 (since 2 extroverts can be paired with 1 universal in one tent, and the remaining 2 universals can be in another tent).
     - `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns 1 (introverts) + 2 (from `func_1`) = 3.
   - **Test Case 2: (1, 4, 1)**
     - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None` (since 4 extroverts need 2 more people to complete the last tent, but there is only 1 universal).
     - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns -1.
   - **Test Case 3: (1, 4, 2)**
     - `func_1(4, 2)` returns 2 (since 4 extroverts can be paired with 2 universals in two tents).
     - `func_2(1, 4, 2)` returns 1 (introverts) + 2 (from `func_1`) = 3.
   - **Test Case 4: (1, 1, 1)**
     - `func_1(1, 1)` returns `None` (since 1 extrovert needs 2 more people to complete the tent, but there is only 1 universal).
     - `func_2(1, 1, 1)` returns -1.
   - **Test Case 5: (1, 3, 2)**
     - `func_1(3, 2)` returns 2 (since 3 extroverts can be in one tent, and the 2 universals can be in another tent).
     - `func_2(1, 3, 2)` returns 1 (introverts) + 2 (from `func_1`) = 3.
   - **Test Case 6: (19, 7, 18)**
     - `func_1(7, 18)` returns 9 (since 7 extroverts can be paired with 2 universals in one tent, and the remaining 16 universals can be in 5 more tents).
     - `func_2(19, 7, 18)` returns 19 (introverts) + 9 (from `func_1`) = 28.
   - **Test Case 7: (0, 0, 0)**
     - `func_1(0, 0)` returns 0.
     - `func_2(0, 0, 0)` returns 0.
   - **Test Case 8: (7, 0, 0)**
     - `func_1(0, 0)` returns 0.
     - `func_2(7, 0, 0)` returns 7 (introverts) + 0 (from `func_1`) = 7.
   - **Test Case 9: (0, 24, 0)**
     - `func_1(24, 0)` returns 8 (since 24 extroverts can be divided into 8 tents of 3 people each).
     - `func_2(0, 24, 0)` returns 0 (introverts) + 8 (from `func_1`) = 8.
   - **Test Case 10: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
     - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)` returns 666666667 (since 1000000000 extroverts can be divided into 333333333 tents of 3 people each, and the remaining 666666667 universals can be divided into 333333333 more tents of 3 people each).
     - `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)` returns 1000000000 (introverts) + 666666667 (from `func_1`) = 1666666667.
