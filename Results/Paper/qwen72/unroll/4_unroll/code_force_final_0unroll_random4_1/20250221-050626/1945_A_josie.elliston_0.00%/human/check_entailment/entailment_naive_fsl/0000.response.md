Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly account for the requirement that each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

In this case, there is 1 introvert, 2 extroverts, and 1 universal. The introvert must be in a tent alone, which uses up 1 tent. The 2 extroverts need to be in a tent with exactly 2 other people, but there is only 1 universal available, making it impossible to fulfill the extroverts' requirement. The program, however, returns 2, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
