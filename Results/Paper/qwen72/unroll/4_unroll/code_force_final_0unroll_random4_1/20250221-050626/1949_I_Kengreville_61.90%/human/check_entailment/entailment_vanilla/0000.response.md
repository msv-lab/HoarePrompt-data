### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to change the radii of the given disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap in a region of positive area.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of the number of disks \( n \) and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   - The output is \(\texttt{YES}\) if it's possible to change the radii as described, otherwise \(\texttt{NO}\).

3. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - For each connected component, it calculates coefficients \( \text{coef0} \) and \( \text{coef1} \) to determine if the radii can be adjusted to meet the criteria.

4. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - The program initializes arrays for \( x \), \( y \), \( r \), \( \text{visited} \), \( \text{coef0} \), and \( \text{coef1} \).
     - It reads the input and stores the coordinates and radii of the disks.
   - **DFS Function:**
     - The `dfs` function is used to explore all disks that are tangent to the current disk.
     - It sets the coefficients for each disk in the connected component.
   - **Main Function:**
     - The main function `func_1` iterates over all disks and performs DFS for each unvisited disk.
     - It calculates the sum of \( \text{coef0} \) and \( \text{coef1} \) for each connected component.
     - If \( \text{coef1} \) is non-zero for any connected component, it prints \(\texttt{YES}\), otherwise \(\texttt{NO}\).

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Tangency Condition:**
     - The program correctly identifies tangency by checking if the distance between the centers of two disks equals the sum of their radii.
   - **Connected Components:**
     - The DFS function correctly explores all disks that are part of the same connected component of tangency.
   - **Coefficient Calculation:**
     - The coefficients \( \text{coef0} \) and \( \text{coef1} \) are used to determine if the radii can be adjusted.
     - The program sets \( \text{coef0}[i] = 0 \) and \( \text{coef1}[i] = 1 \) for the starting disk in each component.
     - For each disk \( j \) tangent to disk \( i \), it sets \( \text{coef0}[j] = r[i] + r[j] - \text{coef0}[i] \) and \( \text{coef1}[j] = -\text{coef1}[i] \).
   - **Sum of Coefficients:**
     - The program checks if the sum of \( \text{coef1} \) for any connected component is non-zero.
     - If \( \text{coef1} \) is non-zero, it means there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of radii decreases while maintaining tangency and non-overlap.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are no disks (i.e., \( n = 1 \)) correctly.
   - It also handles the case where disks are not tangent to each other correctly by treating each disk as a separate component.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to change the radii of the disks to meet the given criteria. The logic and implementation are sound.

Correctness: **True**
