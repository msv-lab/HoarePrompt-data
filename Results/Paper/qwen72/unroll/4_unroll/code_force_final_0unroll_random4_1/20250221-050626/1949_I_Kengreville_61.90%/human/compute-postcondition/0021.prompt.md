You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. x, y, and r are lists of integers where len(x) == len(y) == len(r) == n, and for each i, -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9. visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of boolean and integer values, respectively, with len(visited) == len(coef0) == len(coef1) == n. nodes is an empty list.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, and `nodes` is an empty list.
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list where each element is `True` if the corresponding index has been visited by the `dfs` function, `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is `0` if the corresponding index has been visited by the `dfs` function, `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding index has been visited by the `dfs` function, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `True` if any of the `dfs` function calls resulted in a non-empty `nodes` list, otherwise `False`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *`x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers with length `n`. `visited` is a list where each element is `True` if the corresponding index has been visited by the `dfs` function. `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is `0` if the corresponding index has been visited by the `dfs` function. `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding index has been visited by the `dfs` function. `nodes` is an empty list. If `ok` is `True`, at least one of the `dfs` function calls resulted in a non-empty `nodes` list. If `ok` is `False`, none of the `dfs` function calls resulted in a non-empty `nodes` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes predefined lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` based on the integer `n`, and returns a result based on the processing of these lists.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
