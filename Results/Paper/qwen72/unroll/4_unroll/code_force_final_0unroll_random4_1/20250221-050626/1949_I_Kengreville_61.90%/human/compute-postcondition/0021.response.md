Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and `n` sets of coordinates and radii from the user input. It then processes these inputs using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to determine if there is any set of nodes that, when visited, results in a non-zero sum of coefficients (`coef1`). The function modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists to reflect the nodes visited by the DFS. Finally, it prints 'YES' if any DFS call results in a non-empty list of nodes, and 'NO' otherwise. After the function concludes, `x`, `y`, and `r` remain lists of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of booleans indicating which nodes have been visited, `coef0` is a list of integers where visited nodes have a value of `0`, `coef1` is a list of integers where visited nodes have a value of `1`, and `nodes` is an empty list. **
