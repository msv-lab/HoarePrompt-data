Output State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers representing the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node. Each connection is bidirectional, and each node (except for the leaf nodes) will have at least one connection. The total number of connections added to the lists is `2 * (n - 1)`.
