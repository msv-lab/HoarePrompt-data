Output State: **`n` remains the same, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node, forming an undirected graph, `d` is the shortest distance from node `a` to all other nodes in the graph, `previous` is a list containing the previous node in the shortest path from node `a` to each node, `_` is an unused variable, `a` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`.**
