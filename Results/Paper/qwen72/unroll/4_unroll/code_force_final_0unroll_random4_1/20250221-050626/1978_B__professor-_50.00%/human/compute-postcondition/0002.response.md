Output State: **The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not retained after each iteration of the loop, and the loop runs `t` times, printing a result for each set of inputs. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are re-assigned in each iteration based on the input, and their final values after the loop are the values from the last iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged.**
