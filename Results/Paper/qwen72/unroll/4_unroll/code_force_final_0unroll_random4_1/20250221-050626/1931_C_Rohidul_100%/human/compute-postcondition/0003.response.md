Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints a value `ans` for each test case, which represents the length of the array `a` minus the maximum length of the longest consecutive segments of equal elements at the beginning or the end of the array. If the first and last elements of the array are the same, `ans` is adjusted to be the length of the array minus the sum of the lengths of these segments, ensuring that `ans` is non-negative. The function does not return any values, but it prints the result for each test case. **
