Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is flawed. 

- If \( k \geq n - 1 \), the program correctly prints 1, as Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, isolating it.
- However, if \( k < n - 1 \), the program incorrectly prints \( n - 1 \). This is not always correct because the number of islands Everule can visit depends on the number of bridges destroyed and the structure of the remaining graph.

For example, in the third test case where \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 1 \), the program prints 3, but the correct answer is 4. Dominater can destroy one bridge, but Everule can still visit all 4 islands by using the remaining bridges.

The correct logic should be:
- If \( k \geq n - 1 \), print 1 (Everule is isolated).
- Otherwise, print \( n - \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n-1} \right\rfloor \), which accounts for the number of islands that can be isolated by destroying \( k \) bridges.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - k // (n - 1))
```

This program correctly handles all the test cases provided in the problem description.
