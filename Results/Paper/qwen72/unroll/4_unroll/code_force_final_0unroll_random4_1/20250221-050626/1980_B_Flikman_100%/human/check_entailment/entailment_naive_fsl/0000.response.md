Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes, and it is not necessarily removed or kept based on the sorting and removal process. Specifically, the program only counts the number of times the favorite value is removed, but it does not consider the possibility that the favorite cube itself might be one of the cubes that are not removed if multiple cubes have the same value.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
In this case, the favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3. After sorting, the array could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. If the favorite cube ends up in the third position, it will not be removed. However, the program will output "MAYBE" because it only counts the number of times the value 3 is removed, not the specific position of the favorite cube.

This is a potential case where the program does not work as expected, hence the correctness is **False**.
