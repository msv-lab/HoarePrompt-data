The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted; it will take values from 0 to `t-1` as the loop iterates.

Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
