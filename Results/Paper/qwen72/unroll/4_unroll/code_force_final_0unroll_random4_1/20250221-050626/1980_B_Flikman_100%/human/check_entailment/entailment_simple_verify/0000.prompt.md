You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: The loop has finished executing for all t test cases. For each test case, the variables n, f, k, a, favorite_value, sorted_a, and removed_count have been updated and used to determine the output ('YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE'). The values of these variables are not retained between test cases, so they will be reset for each new test case. The initial state of t remains unchanged, and the loop has executed t times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes, and it is not necessarily removed or kept based on the sorting and removal process. Specifically, the program only counts the number of times the favorite value is removed, but it does not consider the possibility that the favorite cube itself might be one of the cubes that are not removed if multiple cubes have the same value.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
In this case, the favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3. After sorting, the array could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. If the favorite cube ends up in the third position, it will not be removed. However, the program will output "MAYBE" because it only counts the number of times the value 3 is removed, not the specific position of the favorite cube.

This is a potential case where the program does not work as expected, hence the correctness is **False**.
