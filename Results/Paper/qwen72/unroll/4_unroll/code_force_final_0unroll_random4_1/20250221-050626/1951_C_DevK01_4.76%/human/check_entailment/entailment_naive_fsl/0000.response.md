Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be bought is less than the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a single day. Specifically, the logic for calculating the cost when `k < m` is not handled correctly. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 100 1
10000 1 100 10 1000
```
The expected output is `1`, because the optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket on the second day, which has the lowest price. However, the program will incorrectly output a higher value because it does not handle the case where `k < m` properly. The program assumes that the number of tickets to be bought is always a multiple of `m` or close to it, which is not always the case.
