Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. For each test case, the output is either `n * a` if `a >= b`, or the sum of `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)` and `(n - k) * a` if `a < b`, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are input for each test case.**
