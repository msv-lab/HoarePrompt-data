### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`. If this condition is true, it means that selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit.
   - In this case, the program prints `n * a`, which is the total profit from selling all buns at the usual price. This is correct because if `a >= b`, the modified price will not be more profitable.

3. **Profit Calculation for Modified Price**:
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The value of `k` is set to `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a modified price without the modified price dropping below the usual price `a`.
   - The program then calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price. The formula used is `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, which is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total profit, which is the sum of the profit from the first `k` buns and the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns.

### Verification:

- **Case 1**: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - Since `a < b`, `k = min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2`.
  - Profit from the first `k` buns: `int((5 + (5 - 2 + 1)) / 2 * 2) = int((5 + 4) / 2 * 2) = int(9 / 2 * 2) = 9`.
  - Profit from the remaining `n - k` buns: `(4 - 2) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8`.
  - Total profit: `9 + 8 = 17`.

- **Case 2**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `a < b`, `k = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
  - Profit from the first `k` buns: `int((9 + (9 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5) = int((9 + 5) / 2 * 5) = int(14 / 2 * 5) = 35`.
  - Profit from the remaining `n - k` buns: `(5 - 5) * 5 = 0`.
  - Total profit: `35 + 0 = 35`.

- **Case 3**: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - Since `a >= b`, the program prints `10 * 10 = 100`.

- **Case 4**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `a < b`, `k = min(11 - 5 + 1, 5) = 7` (but `k` is capped at `n`, so `k = 5`).
  - Profit from the first `k` buns: `int((11 + (11 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5) = int((11 + 7) / 2 * 5) = int(18 / 2 * 5) = 45`.
  - Profit from the remaining `n - k` buns: `(5 - 5) * 5 = 0`.
  - Total profit: `45 + 0 = 45`.

- **Case 5**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
  - Since `a >= b`, the program prints `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

- **Case 6**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
  - Since `a >= b`, the program prints `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

- **Case 7**: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
  - Since `a < b`, `k = min(1000 - 1 + 1, 1000) = 1000`.
  - Profit from the first `k` buns: `int((1000 + (1000 - 1000 + 1)) / 2 * 1000) = int((1000 + 1) / 2 * 1000) = int(1001 / 2 * 1000) = 500500`.
  - Profit from the remaining `n - k` buns: `(1000 - 1000) * 1 = 0`.
  - Total profit: `500500 + 0 = 500500`.

### Evaluation:
