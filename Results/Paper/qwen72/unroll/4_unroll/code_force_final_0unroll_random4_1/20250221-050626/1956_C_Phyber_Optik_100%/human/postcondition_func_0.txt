The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of a matrix. The function calculates a sum based on the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to n, and prints this sum alongside `n + n`. Additionally, for each value of `j` from 1 to n, it prints two lines: the first line contains `1, n - j + 1,` followed by the numbers from 1 to n, and the second line contains `2, n - j + 1,` followed by the numbers from 1 to n. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
