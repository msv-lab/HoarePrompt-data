Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the maximum sum for the matrix. The formula used to calculate the sum is incorrect. For example, for \( n = 2 \), the correct maximum sum is 7, but the program calculates it as 9. This is because the formula \( \text{sum} += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i \) does not correctly account for the sum of the permutations used in the operations.

Additionally, the operations printed by the program are not optimal. The program always assigns the same permutation to each row and column, which does not necessarily maximize the sum. For instance, for \( n = 2 \), the operations should be:

```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```

But the program outputs:

```
9 4
1 2 1 2
2 2 1 2
1 1 1 2
2 1 1 2
```

This does not follow the problem description, as it does not maximize the sum correctly and uses more operations than necessary.
