Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements. The formula used in the program to calculate the sum is flawed.

The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( n^3 \). This is because each element in the matrix can be set to a value between 1 and \( n \), and the sum of the maximum values for each element is \( n \times n \times n = n^3 \).

The program provided calculates the sum using a formula that does not match this correct value. Specifically, the formula:

```python
sum = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
```

is incorrect. This formula is attempting to calculate the sum of the first \( n \) cubes, but it is not doing so correctly. The correct formula for the sum of the first \( n \) cubes is:

\[ \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 \]

However, for this problem, the maximum sum is simply \( n^3 \).

Additionally, the operations performed in the program are not optimal. The program is setting rows and columns to the same permutation, which is not necessary to achieve the maximum sum. Instead, you can achieve the maximum sum by setting each row and each column to the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) in a way that maximizes the sum.

### Correct Solution:
To achieve the maximum sum \( n^3 \) with no more than \( 2n \) operations, you can simply set each row and each column to the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * n
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, j, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, j, *range(1, n + 1))
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the operations to achieve it. Each row and each column is set to the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), ensuring that the sum of all elements in the matrix is \( n^3 \).
