You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        print(sum, n + n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of a matrix. The function calculates a sum based on the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to n, and prints this sum alongside `n + n`. Additionally, for each value of `j` from 1 to n, it prints two lines: the first line contains `1, n - j + 1,` followed by the numbers from 1 to n, and the second line contains `2, n - j + 1,` followed by the numbers from 1 to n. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Nene has an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - She can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - The sum of the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Since there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It calculates the sum using the formula \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i \).
   - This formula simplifies to \( \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} \), which is incorrect for the problem's requirements. The correct formula should be \( \text{sum} = n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

4. **Operations:**
   - The program outputs \( n + n \) operations, which is \( 2n \) operations.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations.
   - Each operation uses the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which is correct for maximizing the sum.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The sum calculation is incorrect, but the operations are correct and will indeed fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) in both rows and columns.
   - The number of operations is within the limit of \( 2n \).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the sum calculation is wrong. The correct sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), not the sum calculated by the program.
