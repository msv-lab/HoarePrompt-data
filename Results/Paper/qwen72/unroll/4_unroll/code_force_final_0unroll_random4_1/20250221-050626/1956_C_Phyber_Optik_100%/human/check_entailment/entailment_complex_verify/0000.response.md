Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the sum calculation in the program is flawed. The formula used in the program, \(\text{sum} += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\), is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum of the matrix.
   - The correct maximum sum for an \(n \times n\) matrix can be derived by understanding that each operation can fill a row or a column with the permutation of numbers from 1 to \(n\). The maximum sum is achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values, which is the sum of all numbers from 1 to \(n\) repeated \(n\) times.
   - The correct formula for the maximum sum is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} i = n \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}\).

2. **Operations**:
   - The original assessment also correctly points out that the operations printed by the program are not optimal. The program always assigns the same permutation to each row and column, which does not necessarily maximize the sum.
   - The problem description states that the maximum possible sum can always be obtained in no more than \(2n\) operations. The program prints \(2n\) operations, but the operations themselves are not optimal.
   - For \(n = 2\), the correct operations should be:
     ```
     7 3
     1 1 1 2
     1 2 1 2
     2 1 1 2
     ```
   - The program, however, outputs:
     ```
     9 4
     1 2 1 2
     2 2 1 2
     1 1 1 2
     2 1 1 2
     ```
   - This is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description and does not maximize the sum correctly.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to ensure that each row and each column contains the permutation of numbers from 1 to \(n\). This can be achieved by performing \(n\) type 1 operations and \(n\) type 2 operations, but the permutations used should be different to ensure the matrix is filled optimally.
   - For example, for \(n = 2\), the correct operations would be:
     - Type 1 operation on row 1: \([1, 2]\)
     - Type 1 operation on row 2: \([2, 1]\)
     - Type 2 operation on column 1: \([1, 2]\)
     - Type 2 operation on column 2: \([2, 1]\)
   - This ensures that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the maximum sum and does not print the optimal operations.

Final: **False**
