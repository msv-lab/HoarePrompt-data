Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. For each test case, the final value of `sum` is calculated as the sum of the series (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i for i from 2 to n, and the value of `n + n` is printed alongside it. Additionally, for each value of `j` from 1 to n, two lines are printed: the first line contains `1, n - j + 1,` followed by the numbers from 1 to n, and the second line contains `2, n - j + 1,` followed by the numbers from 1 to n. The loop variable `_` has been iterated from 0 to t-1, and the loop variable `i` has been iterated from 2 to n for each test case. The loop variable `j` has been iterated from 1 to n for each test case.**
