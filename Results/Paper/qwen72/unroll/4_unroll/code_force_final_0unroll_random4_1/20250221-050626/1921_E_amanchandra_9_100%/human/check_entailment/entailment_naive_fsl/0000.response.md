Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. One specific issue is in the logic for determining the outcome of the game. The program seems to rely on the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's x-coordinates and y-coordinates, but it does not fully account for the possible movements and the conditions under which a player can win or the game can end in a draw.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5 5 1 1 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (4, 5).
- Alice can move to (2, 1), (2, 2), or (2, 3).
- Bob can move to (3, 5), (3, 4), or (3, 6) (but (3, 6) is out of bounds, so he can only move to (3, 5) or (3, 4)).
- Alice can then move to (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), or (3, 5).
- Bob can move to (2, 5) or (2, 4).
- Alice can then move to (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), or (4, 5).
- Bob can move to (1, 5) or (1, 4).
- Alice can then move to (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), or (5, 5).

In this scenario, Alice can win by moving to (4, 5) on her second turn, which Bob will occupy on his second turn. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" because it does not correctly simulate the game's movements and outcomes.

The program's logic for determining the draw condition and the winning condition is flawed, leading to incorrect results in certain cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
