Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads six integers `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input. The function then determines and prints the result of a game for each test case, which can be either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. The result is based on the relative positions of `a` and `c`, and the distances between `b`, `d`, and the calculated values `l` and `r`. After processing all test cases, the function does not retain any of the input values, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. The final state of the program is that the input for each test case has been consumed, and the corresponding results have been printed. **
