### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if the array `a` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them).
   - It first creates a sorted version of the array `a` and then concatenates `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
   - It then checks if any segment of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (the length of the original array) matches the sorted version of `a`.
   - If such a segment is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
   - This approach is correct because if a segment of `concatenated_a` matches the sorted version of `a`, it means that by splitting `a` at the appropriate index and swapping the parts, the array can be sorted.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is designed to handle multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract the number of test cases `t`, and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length `n` of the array and the elements of the array `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results, one per line.
   - This function correctly processes the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, collecting and printing the results as required.

### Conclusion:
Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly to meet the problem description. The logic in `func_1` is sound and the input handling in `func_2` is appropriate for the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
