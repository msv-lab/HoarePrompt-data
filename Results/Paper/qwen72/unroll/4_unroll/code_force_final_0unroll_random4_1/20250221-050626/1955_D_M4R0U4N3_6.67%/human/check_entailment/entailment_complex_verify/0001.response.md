### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - The program initializes a set `todo` with the elements of `b`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and checks if each element is in `todo`.
   - If an element is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - If an element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - This step ensures that the initial subsegment of `a` is checked for matching elements with `b`.

3. **Counting Good Subsegments:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1 if the initial subsegment is good (i.e., if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`).
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new element `a[r]`:
     - It removes the element `a[r-m]` from either `extra` or `done` and potentially adds it back to `todo`.
     - It checks if the new element `a[r]` is in `todo` and updates the sets accordingly.
     - It increments `ans` if the current subsegment is good (i.e., if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of good subsegments for each test case.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Initial Subsegment Check:**
  - The program correctly checks the first `m` elements of `a` and updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` accordingly.
  - This ensures that the initial subsegment is checked for the required number of matching elements.

- **Sliding Window:**
  - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` in `a`.
  - It correctly updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` as it slides the window.
  - The logic for removing the old element and adding the new element is correct.

- **Counting Good Subsegments:**
  - The program correctly counts the number of good subsegments by checking if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` after each update.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 or when `k` is equal to `m`.
  - It also handles cases where `a` and `b` have duplicate elements.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial Subsegment Check:**
  - The initial subsegment check is accurate. The program correctly identifies the elements in the first `m` elements of `a` that match elements in `b` and updates the sets accordingly.

- **Sliding Window:**
  - The sliding window logic is correct. The program efficiently updates the sets by removing the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the new element that is sliding into the window.
  - The condition for adding an element back to `todo` when it is removed from `done` is correctly handled.

- **Counting Good Subsegments:**
  - The program correctly counts the number of good subsegments by checking the size of `done` after each update.
  - The initial count of `ans` is set to 1 if the first subsegment is good, and then it is incremented for each subsequent good subsegment.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles edge cases where `k` is 1 or `k` is equal to `m`.
  - It also handles cases where `a` and `b` have duplicate elements, as the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are updated correctly to reflect the current state of the subsegment.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting good subsegments based on the problem description. It uses a sliding window approach and set operations to efficiently check each subsegment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
