Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where elements in array `b` are not unique. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
7 4 3
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 2 4
```

The expected output should be `3`, as the subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, and 3 are good. However, the program will output `2` because it uses sets (`todo`, `done`, `extra`) which do not account for the multiplicity of elements in `b`. Specifically, the program will incorrectly remove the second `2` from `todo` when it encounters the first `2` in `a`, leading to an incorrect count of good subsegments.
