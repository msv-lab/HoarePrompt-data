### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the elements of array `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The program initializes a set `todo` with the elements of array `b`.
   - It also initializes two sets `done` and `extra` to keep track of elements that are in the current subarray of `a` and match `b` (in `done`) or do not match `b` (in `extra`).

3. **First Subarray**:
   - The program iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and updates `todo`, `done`, and `extra` accordingly.
   - If an element in the first `m` elements of `a` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - Otherwise, it is added to `extra`.

4. **Counting Good Subarrays**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1 if the first subarray is good (i.e., if `len(done) >= k`), otherwise 0.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements of `a` (from index `m` to `n-1`):
     - It removes the element that is leaving the current subarray (`old`) from either `extra` or `done` and potentially adds it back to `todo`.
     - It adds the new element that is entering the current subarray (`a[r]`) to either `done` or `extra`.
     - If the current subarray is good (i.e., if `len(done) >= k`), it increments `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of good subarrays for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Set Operations**: The program uses sets to keep track of elements, which is efficient for checking membership. However, the use of sets for `todo` and `done` might not correctly handle duplicate elements in `b` and `a`. For example, if `b` contains multiple occurrences of the same element, removing one occurrence from `todo` might not reflect the correct count of required matches.
- **Correctness of `todo` and `done`**: The program assumes that removing an element from `todo` and adding it to `done` is sufficient to track the number of matches. This might not be accurate if `b` contains duplicates.

### Correctness:
- The program is **not** correct because it does not handle duplicate elements in `b` and `a` properly. The use of sets for `todo` and `done` can lead to incorrect results when `b` contains duplicate elements.

### Correctness: **False**
