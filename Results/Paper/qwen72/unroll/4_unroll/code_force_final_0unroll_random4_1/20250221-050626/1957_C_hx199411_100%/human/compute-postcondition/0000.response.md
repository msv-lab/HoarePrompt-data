Output State: **`t` is the integer value input by the user, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and for each of the k moves, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and (r_i, c_i) are valid moves ensuring no two rooks attack each other. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

The value of `t` is updated to the integer value input by the user, while the conditions and constraints for `n`, `k`, `r_i`, and `c_i` remain unchanged.
