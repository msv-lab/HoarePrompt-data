The function `func` accepts multiple parameters for each test case. The parameters are `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` (integers for each test case representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively), `p` (a list of integers representing the permutation), and `a` (a list of integers representing the array). The parameters should satisfy the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns the result of the game for each test case. The result is determined based on the parameters provided for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. It returns the outcome of the game for each test case, where `n` is the length of the permutation, `k` is the duration of the game, `P_B` and `P_S` are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, `p` is a list representing the permutation, and `a` is a list representing the array.**
