Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case.**

However, the function definition provided is incomplete. It should be:
```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```
Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the periodicities of the signs for a specific test case.
