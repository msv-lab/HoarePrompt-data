Output State: **`a` is a binary string provided by the user, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `m` is an integer provided by the user, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `b` is a binary string provided by the user, `k` is 0, `j` is 0.**

The variable `j` is assigned the value 0. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `j`.
