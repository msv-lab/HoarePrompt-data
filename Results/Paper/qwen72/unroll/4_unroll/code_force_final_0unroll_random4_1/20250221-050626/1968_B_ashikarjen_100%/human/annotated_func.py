#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `a` remains the same binary string provided by the user, `n` remains the same integer provided by the user, `m` remains the same integer provided by the user, `t` remains the same integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `b` remains the same binary string provided by the user, `k` is the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order, `j` is the position in `b` just after the last matching character found or `m` if no more matches are found.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order and prints this count `k`. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `t` remain unchanged, and `k` is the number of matching characters found.
