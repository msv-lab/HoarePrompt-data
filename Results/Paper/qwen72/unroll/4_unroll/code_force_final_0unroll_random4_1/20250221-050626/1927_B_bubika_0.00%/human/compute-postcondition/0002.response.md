The loop head contains the variable `t` and the loop iterator `t` itself. For the loop to execute, the range must be greater than 0, which means the input value must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is the number of test cases, and it is already given that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. Therefore, the state of `t` does not need to be adjusted, but we need to ensure that the input is a valid integer within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros**
