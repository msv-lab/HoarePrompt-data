The function `func` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. The integer `n` represents the length of a lost string, and the list `a` represents the trace of the string, where each element `a_i` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`. The function processes each test case and returns a suitable string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z that matches the given trace. The function handles up to `t` test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 \cdot 10^5`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It returns a suitable string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z that matches the given trace for each test case.**
