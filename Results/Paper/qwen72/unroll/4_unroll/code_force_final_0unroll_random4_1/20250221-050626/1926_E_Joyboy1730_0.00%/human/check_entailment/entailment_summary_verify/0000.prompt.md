You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow *= 2



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific number based on the values of `n` and `k`. The function does not return any value, but it prints a result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying the input variables `t`, `n`, and `k`. The list `L` remains empty, and the variables `tot` and `pow` are reset to 0 and 1, respectively, for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Generating the Sequence**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `L` but never populates it with the correct values. The problem requires laying down cards in a specific order, but the program does not generate this order correctly.
   - The while loop `while n:` is intended to calculate the number of cards in each step, but it does not actually generate the sequence of cards laid down.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`**:
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is supposed to represent the number of odd-numbered cards in the current step. However, this calculation is not used correctly to generate the sequence of cards.

3. **Incorrect Handling of `k`**:
   - The program attempts to adjust `k` by subtracting `tot` from it, which is not the correct way to handle the position of the card. The position `k` should be used to determine the specific card in the sequence, not to adjust it in this manner.

4. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program prints `pow * (2 * k - 1)` which is not the correct formula for determining the k-th card in the sequence. The correct formula should take into account the order in which the cards are laid down, as described in the problem.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when `n` is 1, the program should output 1, but it does not handle this case properly.

To illustrate, let's consider the test case `n = 7` and `k = 4`:
- According to the problem, the sequence of cards laid down is `1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4`.
- The 4th card laid down is `7`.
- However, the program does not generate this sequence correctly and will not output `7` for this test case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
