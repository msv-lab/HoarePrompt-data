### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Card Laying Down Process**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `L` to store the number of cards laid down at each step.
   - It then enters a loop to determine the number of cards laid down at each step. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards in the current set of cards.
   - It subtracts `m` from `n` to update the remaining number of cards.
   - However, the program does not append `m` to the list `L` at any point, which is a critical oversight.

3. **Finding the k-th Card**:
   - The program initializes `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1.
   - It then iterates over the list `L` to find the k-th card.
   - The condition `if tot < k and k <= tot + a` is intended to check if the k-th card falls within the current step.
   - If the condition is met, it prints the k-th card as `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.
   - The program updates `tot` and `k` and multiplies `pow` by 2 for the next step.

4. **Critical Issue**:
   - The list `L` is never populated with the number of cards laid down at each step. This means the loop that iterates over `L` will never execute, and the program will not correctly determine the k-th card.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The list `L` should be populated with the number of cards laid down at each step. For example, for `n = 7`, the list `L` should be `[4, 2, 1]` because:
     - First step: 4 odd-numbered cards (1, 3, 5, 7).
     - Second step: 2 cards that are twice an odd number (2, 6).
     - Third step: 1 card that is 4 times an odd number (4).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect because it does not populate the list `L` with the number of cards laid down at each step, leading to an empty list and incorrect output.

### Correctness:
**False**
