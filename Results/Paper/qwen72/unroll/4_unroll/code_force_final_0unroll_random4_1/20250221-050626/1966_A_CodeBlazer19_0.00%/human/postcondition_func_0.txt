The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the length of a list of integers and `k` is the number of cards to exchange. It then reads a list of `n` integers from the input. The function prints `k - 1` for each test case. The function does not modify the input values or the state of the program beyond the printed output.
