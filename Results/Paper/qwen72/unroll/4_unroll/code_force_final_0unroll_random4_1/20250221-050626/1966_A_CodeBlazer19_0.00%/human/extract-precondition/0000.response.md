Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `cards` (1 <= len(cards) <= 100) representing the numbers on the cards, and an integer `k` (2 <= k <= 100) representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 500).**
