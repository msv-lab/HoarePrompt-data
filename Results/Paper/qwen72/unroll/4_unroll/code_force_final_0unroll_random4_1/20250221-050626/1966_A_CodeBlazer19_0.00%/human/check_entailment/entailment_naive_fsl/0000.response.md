Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct approach. The program should consider the number of cards with each number and the operations that can be performed to minimize the number of cards left in the hand.

For example, consider the first test case:
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
The correct output should be `2`, as shown in the problem description. However, the program will output `2` for any input where `k = 3`, regardless of the actual card numbers and their frequencies. This is incorrect.

Another example:
```
7 2
4 2 1 100 5 2 3
```
The correct output should be `1`, but the program will output `1` for any input where `k = 2`, which is not always correct.

The program does not handle the logic of counting the frequencies of the card numbers and performing the operations to minimize the number of cards left. Therefore, it is incorrect.
