You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(k - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `cards` (1 <= len(cards) <= 100) representing the numbers on the cards, and an integer `k` (2 <= k <= 100) representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 500).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 500), `cards` is a list of integers (1 <= len(cards) <= 100), `k` is an integer (2 <= k <= 100). The loop prints `k - 1` for each iteration, but the values of `t`, `cards`, and `k` remain unchanged after the loop finishes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards left after performing a series of operations where you can exchange `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards of any number.

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange number `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `l`.

3. **Output**: The program prints `k - 1` for each test case.

4. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The program does not actually process the list of card numbers `l` in any way.
   - The output `k - 1` is printed without considering the contents of `l`.
   - This suggests that the program is not correctly solving the problem, as the minimum number of cards left depends on the distribution of card numbers in `l`.

5. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The correct solution should consider the frequency of each card number and determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.
   - For example, if `k = 3` and the list of card numbers is `[4, 1, 1, 4, 4]`, the optimal sequence of operations would leave 2 cards, as shown in the problem description.
   - The program should not always print `k - 1` because this is not the correct answer for all cases.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not use the list of card numbers `l` to determine the minimum number of cards left.
   - The output `k - 1` is a constant and does not depend on the input list `l`, which is incorrect.
