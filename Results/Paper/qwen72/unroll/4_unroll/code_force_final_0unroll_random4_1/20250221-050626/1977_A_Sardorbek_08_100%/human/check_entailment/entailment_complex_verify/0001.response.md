### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, representing the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: `if b == c`
     - This condition is correct. If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, Nikita can build the tower by adding one cube per move.
   - **Case 2**: `elif b < c`
     - This condition is also correct. If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to build the tower because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has.
   - **Case 3**: `elif b % 2 == c % 2`
     - This condition is correct. If both `b` and `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), it is possible to build the tower. This is because:
       - If `b` and `c` are both even, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs to end up with `c` cubes.
       - If `b` and `c` are both odd, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs and then add one more cube to end up with `c` cubes.
   - **Case 4**: `else`
     - This condition is correct. If the parities of `b` and `c` are different, it is impossible to build the tower. This is because:
       - If `b` is even and `c` is odd, or vice versa, the number of moves cannot result in the desired number of cubes.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions, which matches the problem description. The output is case-insensitive, so "YES" and "NO" are acceptable.

### Validation of Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and conditions used in the program.
- The conditions and their explanations are accurate and cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
- The output format is also correctly handled, matching the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
