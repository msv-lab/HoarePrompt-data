### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, representing the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: `if b == c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, it is possible to build the tower by simply adding one cube per move. This condition is correct.
   - **Case 2**: `elif b < c`
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to build the tower because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has. This condition is correct.
   - **Case 3**: `elif b % 2 == c % 2`
     - This condition checks if both `b` and `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). If they do, it is possible to build the tower. This is because:
       - If `b` and `c` are both even, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs to end up with `c` cubes.
       - If `b` and `c` are both odd, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs and then add one more cube to end up with `c` cubes.
     - This condition is correct.
   - **Case 4**: `else`
     - If the parities of `b` and `c` are different, it is impossible to build the tower. This is because:
       - If `b` is even and `c` is odd, or vice versa, the number of moves cannot result in the desired number of cubes.
     - This condition is correct.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions, which matches the problem description. The output is case-insensitive, so "YES" and "NO" are acceptable.

### Validation Using Function Summary:
- The function summary confirms that the function `func` processes the input correctly and checks the conditions as described.
- The conditions are logically sound and cover all possible scenarios:
  - `b == c`: Directly possible.
  - `b < c`: Impossible.
  - `b % 2 == c % 2`: Possible if parities match.
  - `else`: Impossible if parities do not match.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
