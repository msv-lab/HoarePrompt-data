Output State: **t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; a is an input integer. The loop has executed a times, and for each iteration, it has printed 'YES' if b == c, 'NO' if b < c, 'Yes' if b % 2 == c % 2, and 'No' otherwise. The values of b, c, and q are not retained after the loop finishes.**
