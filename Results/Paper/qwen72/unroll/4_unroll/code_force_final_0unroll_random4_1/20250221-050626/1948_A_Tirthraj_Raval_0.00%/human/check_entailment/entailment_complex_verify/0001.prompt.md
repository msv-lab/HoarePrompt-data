You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) as input, and handle multiple test cases where the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) is provided. The function should return a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. If no such string can be constructed, the function should return "NO".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, each time reading a new value of `n` from the user. For each `n`, if `n` is odd, it will print 'NO'. If `n` is even, it will print 'YES' followed by a pattern of 'A' and 'B' characters. The pattern will alternate between 'A' and 'B' and will have a length of `n`. The variable `t` will be unchanged, and the variable `n` will hold the last input value read. The list `pattern` will be populated with the last generated pattern if `n` was even, otherwise, it will be an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) from the user, which is the desired length of a string to be generated. If `n` is odd, the function prints "NO". If `n` is even, the function prints "YES" followed by a string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B' characters. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the variable `t` will be unchanged, `n` will hold the last input value read, and `pattern` will be an empty list if the last `n` was odd, or will contain the last generated pattern if the last `n` was even.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'.
   - This is correct because if `n` is odd, it is impossible to have exactly `n` special characters in a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because each special character must be part of a pair, and an odd number of pairs cannot be formed.

3. **Even `n` Handling:**
   - If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES'.
   - It then constructs a pattern to form the string. The pattern is created by alternating 'A' and 'B' in pairs.
   - For example, if `n = 6`, the pattern will be 'ABABAB', which has exactly 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6).

4. **Pattern Construction:**
   - The pattern is constructed using a loop that runs `n // 2` times.
   - In each iteration, it appends two characters to the pattern: one from 'A' and one from 'B', alternating them.
   - The use of `i % 2` and `i % 2 ^ 1` ensures that the characters alternate correctly.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed pattern as a string using `''.join(pattern)`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n`, and it constructs a valid string for even `n` that meets the problem's requirements. The string length is at most `200` for the given constraints, and the pattern ensures that each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Correctness:
**True**
