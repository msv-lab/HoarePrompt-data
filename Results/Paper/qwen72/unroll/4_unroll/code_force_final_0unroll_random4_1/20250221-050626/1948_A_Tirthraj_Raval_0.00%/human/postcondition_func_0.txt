The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) from the user, which is the desired length of a string to be generated. If `n` is odd, the function prints "NO". If `n` is even, the function prints "YES" followed by a string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B' characters. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the variable `t` will be unchanged, `n` will hold the last input value read, and `pattern` will be an empty list if the last `n` was odd, or will contain the last generated pattern if the last `n` was even.
