Reasoning:  
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and determine if a string can be constructed with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program correctly identifies that no such string can be constructed if `n` is odd, as special characters must come in pairs (each special character must have a neighbor that is the same, and this neighbor must also be special).

For even `n`, the program constructs a string by alternating between 'A' and 'B' characters. This approach ensures that each character in the string is special, as each 'A' is followed by a 'B' and each 'B' is followed by an 'A', and the string length is exactly `n`. The pattern generation logic is correct and ensures that the string will have exactly `n` special characters.

The program also correctly handles the output format, printing 'NO' for odd `n` and 'YES' followed by the constructed string for even `n`.

However, there is a minor issue with the program: the constructed string should have a length of at most 200, and the program does not explicitly ensure this. However, since the problem guarantees that `n` is at most 50, the constructed string will never exceed 200 characters, so this is not a practical concern.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in terms of logic and output for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
