Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) as input, and handle multiple test cases where the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) is provided. The function should return a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. If no such string can be constructed, the function should return "NO".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, each time reading a new value of `n` from the user. For each `n`, if `n` is odd, it will print 'NO'. If `n` is even, it will print 'YES' followed by a pattern of 'A' and 'B' characters. The pattern will alternate between 'A' and 'B' and will have a length of `n`. The variable `t` will be unchanged, and the variable `n` will hold the last input value read. The list `pattern` will be populated with the last generated pattern if `n` was even, otherwise, it will be an empty list.
