### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'.
   - This is correct because if `n` is odd, it is impossible to have exactly `n` special characters in a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because each special character must be part of a pair, and an odd number of pairs cannot be formed.

3. **Even `n` Handling:**
   - If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES'.
   - It then constructs a pattern to form the string. The pattern is created by alternating 'A' and 'B' in pairs.
   - For example, if `n = 6`, the pattern will be 'ABABAB', which has exactly 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6).

4. **Pattern Construction:**
   - The pattern is constructed using a loop that runs `n // 2` times.
   - In each iteration, it appends two characters to the pattern: one from 'A' and one from 'B', alternating them.
   - The use of `i % 2` and `i % 2 ^ 1` ensures that the characters alternate correctly.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed pattern as a string using `''.join(pattern)`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n`, and it constructs a valid string for even `n` that meets the problem's requirements. The string length is at most `200` for the given constraints, and the pattern ensures that each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Correctness:
**True**
