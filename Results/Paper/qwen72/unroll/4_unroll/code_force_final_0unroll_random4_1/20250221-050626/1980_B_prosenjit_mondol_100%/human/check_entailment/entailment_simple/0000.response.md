### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, but it reads input from the user within the function. This is acceptable for the given problem since it processes multiple test cases and reads input for each test case.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` from the input and adjusts `f` and `k` by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indexing, which is appropriate for Python lists.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The function sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`. This is correct according to the problem statement, which requires the cubes to be arranged in non-increasing order of their values.

4. **Favorite Cube Value**:
   - The value of the favorite cube is stored in `x` using `x = a[f]`. This is correct because `f` is the original index of the favorite cube, and we need to check its value after sorting.

5. **Conditions**:
   - The function checks if the value of the favorite cube `x` is less than the value of the k-th cube after sorting (`a[k] > x`). If true, it prints 'NO' because the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes.
   - If the value of the favorite cube `x` is greater than the value of the k-th cube after sorting (`a[k] < x`), it prints 'YES' because the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes.
   - If the value of the favorite cube `x` is equal to the value of the k-th cube after sorting (`a[k] == x`), it checks if the favorite cube is the last cube in the list (`k == n - 1`) or if the value of the next cube is less than `x` (`a[k + 1] < x`). If either condition is true, it prints 'YES' because the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube could be among the first `k` cubes or not, depending on the sorting order.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `k` is equal to `n - 1` correctly by checking if the favorite cube is the last cube in the sorted list.
   - It also handles the case where `k + 1` is out of bounds by checking `k == n - 1`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
