#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, n, f, k, a):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `n` is an integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `f` is an integer representing the index of Dmitry's favorite cube (1 ≤ f ≤ n), `k` is an integer representing the number of cubes to be removed (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and `a` is a list of integers representing the values shown on the cubes (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        f -= 1
        
        k -= 1
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = a[f]
        
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop executes for `t` iterations, and for each iteration, the variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are updated with new values provided by the user. After each iteration, the state of these variables is reset to the new input values for the next test case. The function prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the loop completes after `t` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube `f`, the number of cubes to be removed `k`, and a list of integers `a` representing the values shown on the cubes. It then determines whether Dmitry's favorite cube will remain after removing `k` cubes. The function prints 'YES' if the favorite cube will definitely remain, 'NO' if it will definitely be removed, and 'MAYBE' if it might remain depending on the specific cubes removed. The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided at the beginning, and the state of the variables is reset for each test case. The function does not return any values.
