The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times, so it does not need to be explicitly adjusted.

State: **`_` is a throwaway variable, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
