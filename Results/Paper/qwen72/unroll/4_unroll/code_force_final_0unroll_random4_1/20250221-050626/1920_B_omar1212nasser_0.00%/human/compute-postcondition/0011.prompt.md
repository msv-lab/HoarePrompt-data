You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals and negatives are non-negative integers such that 0 <= removals <= len(elements) and 0 <= negatives <= len(elements), elements is a list of integers where each element is in the range 1 to 1000.
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: removals and negatives are non-negative integers such that 0 <= removals <= len(elements) and 0 <= negatives <= len(elements), elements is a list of integers where each element is in the range 1 to 1000, and (removals is not equal to 6 or negatives is not equal to 3)
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    n = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        try:
            n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
        except IndexError:
            n = 0
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * n)
        
    #State: The list `pos` contains the values calculated as (s - 2 * n) after each iteration of the loop, where `s` is the sum of the remaining elements in `elements` after removing the last `removals` elements, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` after removing the last `removals` elements. The variables `removals` and `negatives` remain unchanged.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains values calculated as (s - 2 * n) after each iteration of the loop, where `s` is the sum of the remaining elements in `elements` after removing the last `removals` elements, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` after removing the last `removals` elements.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns 0 if a specific condition is met. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value from a list of calculated values, where each value is the result of subtracting twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements from the sum of the remaining elements in `elements` after removing the last `removals` elements.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains values calculated as (s - 2 * n) after each iteration of the loop, where `s` is the sum of the remaining elements in `elements` after removing the last `removals` elements, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` after removing the last `removals` elements.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
