### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Cases Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Total Score Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
   - This is correct because the total points in any set of games must be even (since each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw).

3. **Score Consistency Check:**
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws.
   - This is correct because if `p3` is at least the sum of `p1` and `p2`, all games could have ended in draws, and the maximum number of draws would be `p1 + p2`.

4. **Complex Case Handling:**
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program enters a more complex logic to determine the maximum number of draws.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` and checks if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` holds.
   - If the condition holds, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid `cur`, it prints `p3`.

5. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is intended to ensure that the remaining points after accounting for `cur` draws are still consistent with the rules of the game.
   - However, the final print statement `p1 - cur + p3` does not correctly account for the total number of draws. The correct number of draws should be derived from the total points and the distribution of wins and losses.
   - The program should instead calculate the total number of games and the number of draws based on the total points and the constraints of the game.

### Detailed Analysis of the Complex Case:
- **Total Points and Games:**
  - The total points `p1 + p2 + p3` must be even.
  - The total number of games `G` can be calculated as `(p1 + p2 + p3) / 2`.
  - The number of draws `D` can be calculated as the total number of games minus the number of wins. Since each win contributes 2 points, the number of wins `W` is `(p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * D) / 2`.
  - The number of draws `D` should be maximized while ensuring that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

- **Correct Condition:**
  - The condition should ensure that the remaining points after accounting for draws can be distributed in a way that is consistent with the scores.
  - The correct condition should be `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * D` is even and the remaining points can be distributed such that `p3` is the maximum score.

### Corrected Logic:
- **Total Points and Draws:**
  - Calculate the total number of games `G` as `(p1 + p2 + p3) / 2`.
  - Calculate the maximum number of draws `D` as `G - (p3 - p1 - p2) / 2`.
  - Ensure that `D` is non-negative and the remaining points can be distributed such that `p3` is the maximum score.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified the logical issue in the complex case handling.
- The program's logic for calculating the maximum number of draws in the complex case is flawed and needs to be corrected.

Final: **False**
