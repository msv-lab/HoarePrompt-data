You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, representing the scores of the three players after all the games. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())

        else:
            low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:

                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed t times, and for each iteration, it will have processed the input scores p1, p2, and p3, printing the appropriate result based on the conditions specified in the loop. The values of p1, p2, and p3 will be updated with each iteration, but the initial values of p_1, p_2, and p_3 provided as input to the function will remain unchanged. The number of test cases t will also remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` (0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30) representing the scores of three players. The function then prints a result for each test case based on the following conditions: If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), it prints the sum of the other two scores. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a value that represents a balanced score distribution. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. The initial values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` provided for each test case remain unchanged, and the number of test cases `t` is also unchanged after the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Cases Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Total Score Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
   - This is correct because the total points in any set of games must be even (since each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw).

3. **Score Consistency Check:**
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws.
   - This is correct because if `p3` is at least the sum of `p1` and `p2`, all games could have ended in draws, and the maximum number of draws would be `p1 + p2`.

4. **Complex Case Handling:**
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program enters a more complex logic to determine the maximum number of draws.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` and checks if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` holds.
   - If the condition holds, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid `cur`, it prints `p3`.

5. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The logic in the complex case is designed to find the maximum number of draws such that the scores remain consistent.
   - The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining points after accounting for `cur` draws are still consistent with the rules of the game.
   - If no valid `cur` is found, the program prints `p3`, which is the maximum number of draws that could have occurred if all points were distributed in draws.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the basic cases where the total score is odd or `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- The complex case logic is designed to find the maximum number of draws, but it seems to have a logical flaw. Specifically, the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` and the final print statement `p1 - cur + p3` do not seem to correctly account for the total number of draws.

### Conclusion:
- The program is partially correct but has a logical issue in the complex case handling. The condition and the final print statement need to be re-evaluated to ensure they correctly determine the maximum number of draws.

Correctness: **False**
