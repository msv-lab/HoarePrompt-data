Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Draws and Wins**: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. The logic in the `while` loop and the conditions around it are overly complex and do not accurately reflect the constraints and the nature of the game (i.e., points distribution).

2. **Incorrect Output for Some Cases**: The program's output for certain test cases is incorrect. For example, for the input `3 3 3`, the program outputs `3`, but the correct answer is `-1` because it is impossible for all three players to have 3 points each without violating the rules of the game.

Let's break down the correct approach:

- **Total Points Check**: The total points \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (if there is a winner and a loser) or 2 points (if it is a draw). If the total is odd, it's impossible to achieve the given scores, so the answer is `-1`.

- **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The maximum number of draws can be calculated by considering the distribution of points. If \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), then the maximum number of draws is \( p_1 + p_2 \) because the third player could have played all their games as draws with the other two players. Otherwise, the maximum number of draws is \( \frac{p_1 + p_2 + p_3}{2} - \frac{p_3 - p_1 - p_2}{2} \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            max_draws = (total_points - (p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2
            print(max_draws)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the total points check and calculates the maximum number of draws based on the given constraints. It should produce the correct output for all test cases.
