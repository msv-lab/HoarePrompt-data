### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Sum Check:**
   - The first condition checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the total points in a set of chess games (where each game results in either 2 points or 1 point per player) must always be even.

3. **High Score Check:**
   - The second condition checks if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. If this is true, the function prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` (since all games could have been draws involving the two players with the lower scores).

4. **Balanced Score Distribution:**
   - If the above conditions are not met, the function enters a loop to find a balanced score distribution. The loop calculates the number of draws by adjusting the scores and ensuring that the distribution is balanced.
   - The loop uses `low` and `high` to find the range of possible draws. It then iterates through this range to find a valid distribution.
   - The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):` checks if the scores can be balanced by subtracting `cur` from `p1` and `p3 - cur` from `p2`. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid distribution, it prints `p3`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case as required.

### Analysis of the Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case: 0 0 0**
   - Sum is 0 (even), and `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
   - No games were played, so the maximum number of draws is 0.
   - **Output: 0** (Correct)

2. **Test Case: 0 1 1**
   - Sum is 2 (even), and `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
   - One game was played, and it ended in a draw.
   - **Output: 1** (Correct)

3. **Test Case: 1 1 1**
   - Sum is 3 (odd), so the function prints -1.
   - **Output: -1** (Correct)

4. **Test Case: 1 1 2**
   - Sum is 4 (even), and `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
   - The loop will find a balanced distribution with 2 draws.
   - **Output: 2** (Correct)

5. **Test Case: 3 3 3**
   - Sum is 9 (odd), so the function prints -1.
   - **Output: -1** (Correct)

6. **Test Case: 3 4 5**
   - Sum is 12 (even), and `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
   - The loop will find a balanced distribution with 6 draws.
   - **Output: 6** (Correct)

7. **Test Case: 1 1 10**
   - Sum is 12 (even), and `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
   - The loop will find a balanced distribution with 2 draws.
   - **Output: 2** (Correct)

### Conclusion:
