### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Check for Odd Total Score:**
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
   - This is correct because the total score must be even, as each game contributes either 2 points (for a win/loss) or 2 points (for a draw).

3. **Check for Maximum Score Condition:**
   - If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`.
   - This is correct because the maximum number of draws that could have happened is `p1 + p2` (all games involving the third player could have been draws).

4. **Binary Search for Draws:**
   - If the above condition is not met, the function attempts to find the maximum number of draws using a binary search-like approach.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores.
   - It iterates from `low` to `high` and checks if the remaining scores after accounting for `cur` draws are consistent with the conditions.
   - If a valid number of draws is found, it prints the result and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no valid number of draws is found, it prints `p3`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the appropriate result for each test case based on the conditions specified.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the odd total score condition and prints `-1` when necessary.
- The function correctly handles the maximum score condition and prints `p1 + p2` when necessary.
- The binary search-like approach is used to find the maximum number of draws, but it seems to be overcomplicating the problem. The logic inside the loop is not straightforward and may not always produce the correct result.

### Simplified Logic:
- If the total score is odd, the result is `-1`.
- If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the result is `p1 + p2`.
- Otherwise, the maximum number of draws can be calculated as `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2 - p3`.

### Conclusion:
The provided function is correct in its overall approach but the binary search-like logic is unnecessary and may lead to incorrect results in some cases. However, the function does handle the basic conditions correctly.

### Correctness: **False**

The function is not entirely correct due to the overcomplicated and potentially incorrect logic in the binary search-like approach. A simpler and more reliable method should be used to calculate the maximum number of draws.
