Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program assumes that there are always 10 test cases, which is not always true according to the problem description. The problem description states that the number of test cases `t` is provided as input, and the program should handle any number of test cases within the range `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`. The current implementation only works correctly if `t` is exactly 10. If `t` is less than 10, the program will attempt to read more inputs than provided, causing an error. If `t` is greater than 10, the program will only process the first 10 test cases, ignoring the rest. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
