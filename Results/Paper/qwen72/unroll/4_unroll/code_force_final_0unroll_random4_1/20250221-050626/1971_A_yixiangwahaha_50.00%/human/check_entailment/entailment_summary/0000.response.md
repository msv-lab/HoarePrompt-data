Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases, `t`, but it always reads exactly 10 test cases regardless of the value of `t`. This is incorrect because the number of test cases should be determined by the value of `t` provided in the input. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `t` is less than 10, which could lead to an error if the user provides fewer than 10 test cases.

The logic for determining and printing the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case is correct. However, the program will not work as expected for any value of `t` other than 10, which violates the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
