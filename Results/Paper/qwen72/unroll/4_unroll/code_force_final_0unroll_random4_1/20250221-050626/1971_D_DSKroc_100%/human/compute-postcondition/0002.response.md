Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `s` is the last binary string input (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each input string `s`, it has printed the number of adjacent character changes, with an additional 1 added if there are no increases in value between adjacent characters.**
