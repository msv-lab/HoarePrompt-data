Precondition: **The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function will be called multiple times with different test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).**

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. To match the problem description, the function should be defined as:

```python
def func(s):
```

With this correction, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **s is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.**
