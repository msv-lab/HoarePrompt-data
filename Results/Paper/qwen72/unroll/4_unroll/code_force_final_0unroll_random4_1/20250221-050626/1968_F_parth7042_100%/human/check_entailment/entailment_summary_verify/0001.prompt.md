You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

from bisect import bisect_left

input = sys.stdin.read

    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])

            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]):

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads input from the user, processes a series of queries on the input data, and prints a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The function modifies the `data` list by consuming its elements, updates the `index` to the position after the last used element, and maintains the `t` value as the number of test cases. The `results` list contains the outcomes of the queries, which are printed at the end of the function. Each 'YES' or 'NO' in the `results` list indicates whether a specific condition is met for each query.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for large inputs.
   - The variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the input list.
   - The number of test cases `t` is read and the program iterates over each test case.

2. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It initializes an array `a` and a prefix XOR array `pf` of size `n + 1`.
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is constructed such that `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. This helps in quickly finding segments with the same XOR value.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - It calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, it means the entire subarray can be split into segments with XOR 0, which is interesting. The program appends "YES" to the results.
   - If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there are indices `v1` and `v2` in the `mp` dictionary such that `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` and `l <= v1[it1] < r` and `l <= v2[it2] < r`. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`).
   - If such indices exist, it means the subarray can be split into segments with the same XOR value, and the program appends "YES" to the results. Otherwise, it appends "NO".

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all queries for all test cases, the program prints the results.

### Analysis:
- **Prefix XOR Calculation:** The prefix XOR array is correctly calculated, which allows for efficient XOR queries.
- **Dictionary for XOR Indices:** The dictionary `mp` is correctly used to store indices of prefix XOR values, which helps in quickly checking if a subarray can be split into segments with the same XOR value.
- **Binary Search for Indices:** The binary search is correctly used to find the appropriate indices in the dictionary.
- **Query Handling:** The logic for handling queries is correct. If the XOR of the subarray is 0, it is interesting. If not, the program checks if there are valid indices to split the subarray into segments with the same XOR value.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently handles the problem as described. It correctly reads the input, constructs the necessary data structures, and processes the queries to determine if subarrays are interesting.

### Correctness:
**True**
