The function `func_1` reads input from the user, processes a series of queries on the input data, and prints a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The function modifies the `data` list by consuming its elements, updates the `index` to the position after the last used element, and maintains the `t` value as the number of test cases. The `results` list contains the outcomes of the queries, which are printed at the end of the function. Each 'YES' or 'NO' in the `results` list indicates whether a specific condition is met for each query.
