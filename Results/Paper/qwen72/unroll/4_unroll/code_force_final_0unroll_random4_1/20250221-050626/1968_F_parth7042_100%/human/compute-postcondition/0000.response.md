Initial State: The function should actually be defined with parameters to handle the input as described in the problem. The correct function definition should be:
```
data = input().split()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it by whitespace, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `data`. Since the initial state does not specify the content of the input, we assume that `input()` will return a string that can be split.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, each string being a part of the input split by whitespace.**
