Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The program as provided does not handle multiple test cases, which is a crucial part of the problem description. The function `func_1` reads and processes only one set of inputs (one test case), and there is no loop or mechanism to handle the `t` test cases specified in the input. This means that the program will only work correctly for the first test case and will fail to read or process subsequent test cases, leading to incorrect output for the remaining cases.

Final: **False**
