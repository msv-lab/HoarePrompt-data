### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the lengths of the two binary strings `a` and `b` from the input.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` themselves.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `k` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0, which will be used to track the current position in string `b`.

3. **Loop Through String `a`:**
   - The function iterates through each character in string `a` using a `for` loop.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it uses a `while` loop to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in string `b` starting from position `j`.
   - If `b[j]` matches `a[i]`, it increments `k` and moves `j` to the next position in `b`.
   - If `j` reaches the end of `b` without finding a match, the `while` loop breaks, and the `for` loop also breaks.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints the value of `k`, which is the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the problem of finding the maximum length `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`.
- The use of the `while` loop ensures that the function finds the next matching character in `b` for each character in `a`.
- The `for` loop ensures that the function checks each character in `a` in order.
- The function correctly breaks out of the loop if it reaches the end of `b` without finding a match, ensuring that it does not attempt to access out-of-bounds indices.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Strings:** The problem guarantees that the lengths of `a` and `b` are at least 1, so this case is not applicable.
- **No Matching Characters:** If `b` does not contain any characters that match the first character of `a`, the function will correctly output `0`.
- **All Characters Matching:** If all characters of `a` are a subsequence of `b`, the function will correctly output the length of `a`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
