Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1()` reads only one set of inputs and does not loop to handle `t` test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
