Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, and the tree is represented as a dictionary or adjacency list where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors.** 

The `queue` is initialized with a deque containing a single tuple, where the first element is the `start` node and the second element is 0, representing the distance from the start node. The values of `start` and `target` remain unchanged, and the tree representation is also unchanged.
