Output State: **The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the number of occurrences of each unique integer in the list `l`. If the maximum count of any integer is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.**
