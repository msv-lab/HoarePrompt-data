Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the cards.
   - This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the frequency of each unique integer in the list `l` using a list comprehension: `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]`.
   - This correctly computes the number of occurrences of each unique card number.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the maximum frequency of any integer in the list `p` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - If `max(p) >= k`, it prints `k - 1`.
   - If `max(p) < k`, it prints `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

However, there is a logical issue in the condition check:
- The program assumes that if the maximum frequency of any integer is greater than or equal to `k`, the result will always be `k - 1`. This is incorrect because the number of cards left after performing the operations depends on the total number of cards and the frequency of each card, not just the maximum frequency.
- The correct approach should be to repeatedly perform the exchange operation until no more operations can be performed, and then count the remaining cards.

To fix this, the program should:
- Use a loop to repeatedly perform the exchange operation.
- Track the number of cards left after each operation.
- Stop when no more operations can be performed and print the remaining number of cards.

Given the current implementation, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the exchange operations and the resulting minimum number of cards.

Correctness: **False**
