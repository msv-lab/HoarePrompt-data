The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the frequency of each unique integer in the list. If the maximum frequency of any integer is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The variables `t` and `test_cases` are not used or modified within the function.
