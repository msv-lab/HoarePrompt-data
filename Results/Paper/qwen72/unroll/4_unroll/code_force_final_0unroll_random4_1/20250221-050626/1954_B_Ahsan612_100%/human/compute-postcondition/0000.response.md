The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter, and the result of `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be at least 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
