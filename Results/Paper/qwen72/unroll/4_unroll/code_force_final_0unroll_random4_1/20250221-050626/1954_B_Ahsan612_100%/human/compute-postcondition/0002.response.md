The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely operates with the following inputs: `t` (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and `a` (a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the conditions specified. Since the array `a` is described as "beautiful" and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, the function is expected to handle multiple test cases and return a result for each.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It returns a result for each test case based on the properties of the "beautiful" array `a`.**
