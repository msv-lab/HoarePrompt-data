Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `a` from the input, then finds the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number in `a` that are not the entire list. If no such segment exists or the entire list is a single segment, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum segment length. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
