Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The logic in the program is based on identifying the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements that is not the entire array. If such a segment is found, the program outputs the length of this segment, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to disrupt the beauty of the array. If no such segment exists or the entire array is a single segment of identical elements, the program outputs `-1`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Segments**: The program increments `i` by 1 after checking `ar[i] == num`, which means it does not correctly handle the case where the segment of identical elements is longer than 1. This can lead to incorrect minimum segment lengths being calculated.

2. **Handling of Consecutive Segments**: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple consecutive segments of the same number. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program should identify the segment `[2, 1, 2]` as a potential candidate to remove, but it does not.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the edge case where the array has only one element. In such a case, the array is already non-beautiful, and the program should output `0` instead of `-1`.

4. **Incorrect Output for All Identical Elements**: If the array consists entirely of the same element, the program should output `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. However, the program might output the length of the array instead of `-1`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
