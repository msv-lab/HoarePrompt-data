Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input, where `N` is a positive integer, `M1` and `M2` are positive integers such that `1 <= M1, M2 <= N`. The variables `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `prefix_max_indices`, and `suffix_max_indices` retain their initial conditions. `L` is a list of integers input by the user.**
