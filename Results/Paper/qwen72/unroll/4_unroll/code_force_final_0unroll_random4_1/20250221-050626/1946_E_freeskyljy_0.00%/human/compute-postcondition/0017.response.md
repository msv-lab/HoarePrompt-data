To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to consider the condition `i > 1`. The variable `i` is the only one in the loop head that can be adjusted to meet this condition.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `L[-1] - 1` must be greater than 1, which means `L[-1]` must be greater than 2.

Since `L[-1]` is the last element of the list `L`, and it is already given that `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, we can infer that `L[-1]` is also `N`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `N` must be greater than 2. However, `N` is already stated to be a positive integer, so we need to ensure that `N` is at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, `M1` and `M2` are positive integers such that `1 <= M1, M2 <= N`. `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `prefix_max_indices`, and `suffix_max_indices` retain their initial conditions. `L` is a list of integers input by the user. `R` is a list of integers input by the user. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. Either `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or the second-to-last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `ans` is the number of combinations of `N - 1` taken `L[-1] - 1` at a time. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `i` is `L[-1] - 1` and must be greater than 1.**
