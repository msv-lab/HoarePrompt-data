Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple blocks of chips with free cells in between them. The program only counts the number of zeros in the trimmed array, which does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
8
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
```
The expected output is `3`, as you need to move the chips in the 3rd, 5th, and 7th positions to the left to form a single block. However, the program will output `4` because it counts all the zeros in the trimmed array, which is incorrect.
