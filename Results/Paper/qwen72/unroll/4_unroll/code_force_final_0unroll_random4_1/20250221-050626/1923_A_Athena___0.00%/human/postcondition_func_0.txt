The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the state of each cell. The function trims the list to remove leading and trailing zeros, then prints the trimmed list. It also calculates and prints the number of zeros in the trimmed list. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains unchanged, and the input lists for each test case are modified by removing leading and trailing zeros.
