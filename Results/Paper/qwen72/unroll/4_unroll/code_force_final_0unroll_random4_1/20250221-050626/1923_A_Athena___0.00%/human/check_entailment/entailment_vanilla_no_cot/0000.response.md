Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Print Statements**: The program includes `print(a)` and `print(res)` statements which are not required by the problem description. These statements will print intermediate results and the modified array, which is not part of the expected output.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for calculating the minimum number of operations is flawed. The program currently counts the number of zeros in the trimmed array, which does not necessarily represent the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.

3. **Trimming the Array**: The program trims the array by removing leading and trailing zeros. This is a good start, but it does not correctly handle the movement of chips within the trimmed array.

4. **Correct Approach**: The correct approach involves finding the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single contiguous block. This can be achieved by:
   - Finding the leftmost and rightmost positions of the chips.
   - Counting the number of chips in the left and right halves of the array.
   - The minimum number of operations is the smaller of the two counts (left or right).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the leftmost and rightmost positions of the chips
        leftmost = None
        rightmost = None
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == 1:
                if leftmost is None:
                    leftmost = i
                rightmost = i
        
        # Count the number of chips in the left and right halves
        left_count = sum(a[leftmost:rightmost+1])
        right_count = sum(a[rightmost+1:]) + sum(a[:leftmost])
        
        # The minimum number of operations is the smaller of the two counts
        res = min(left_count - 1, right_count)
        
        print(res)
```

This corrected version will correctly determine the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them.
