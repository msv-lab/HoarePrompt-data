Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). The function `func_1` is used to find the next occurrence of the character \( a[i] \) in the string \( b \) starting from position \( j \). If the character is found, the indices \( i \) and \( j \) are incremented, and the count \( c \) is increased. If the character is not found, the loop breaks, and the current count \( c \) is printed. This logic ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases, including edge cases where one or both strings are empty, or where the characters in \( a \) do not appear in \( b \) in the required order. The program also correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.
