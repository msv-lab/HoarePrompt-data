The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `p`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, representing the length of the list `p`. `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and `p_i ≠ i`, and all `p_i` are distinct. The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers where each integer `p_i` is between 1 and `n` and `p_i ≠ i`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters.**
