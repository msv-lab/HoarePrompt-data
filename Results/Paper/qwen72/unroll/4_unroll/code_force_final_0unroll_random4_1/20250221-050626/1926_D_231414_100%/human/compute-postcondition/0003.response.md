Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. `times` is an input integer that has been decremented to 0. For each iteration, `n` was an integer read from input, and `data` was a list of integers read from input. `dic` is a dictionary that contains the counts of the XOR results of the elements in `data` with `check` (2^31 - 1). `ans` is the number of unique XOR results that were added to `dic` during each iteration. The final value of `ans` is printed for each iteration. The value of `check` remains 2147483647.**
