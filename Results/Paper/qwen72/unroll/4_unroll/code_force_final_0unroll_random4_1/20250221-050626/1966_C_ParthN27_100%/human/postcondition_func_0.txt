The function reads an integer `t` from input, representing the number of test cases, and then processes each test case. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers from input. It then determines and prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the unique sorted values of the integers. If the list of unique values contains exactly two elements, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, it checks if the difference between consecutive elements is at most 1, and prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the final value of a variable `ans` after processing. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the input variables `t` and the list of lists remain unchanged, while other variables (`n`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`) are reset for each test case.
