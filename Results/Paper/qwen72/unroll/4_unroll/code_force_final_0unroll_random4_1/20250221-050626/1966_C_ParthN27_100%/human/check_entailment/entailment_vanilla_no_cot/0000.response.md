Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in the program to determine the winner is flawed. The program checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1, and uses this to determine the winner. However, this is not the correct approach to determine the winner of the game.

The correct approach to determine the winner in this game is to use the concept of the Nim game, where the key is to check if the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd or even. If the number of such piles is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is because each player can only remove a positive number of stones from each nonempty pile, and the game essentially reduces to a Nim game with a single pile of stones equal to the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Count the number of piles with an odd number of stones
        odd_piles = sum(1 for x in arr if x % 2 == 1)
        # If the number of odd piles is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins
        if odd_piles % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

This corrected version correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy for the given game.
