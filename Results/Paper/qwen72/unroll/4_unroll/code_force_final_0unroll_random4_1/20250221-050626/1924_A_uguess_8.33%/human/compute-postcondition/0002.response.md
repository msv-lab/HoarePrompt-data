Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The loop has processed all t test cases, and for each test case, it has either printed 'YES' if the string s contains at least n distinct subsequences of the first k alphabets, or 'NO' followed by a string that represents the missing sequence to reach n distinct subsequences.**
