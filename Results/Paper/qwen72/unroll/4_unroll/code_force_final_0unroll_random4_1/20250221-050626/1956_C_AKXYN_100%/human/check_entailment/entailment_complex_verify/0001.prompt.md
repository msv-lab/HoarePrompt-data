You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        
        print(res, n << 1)
        
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, the value of `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, and the value of `n << 1` is 2 * n. Additionally, for each test case, the loop prints two lines for each i from n to 1: the first line is "1 i" followed by the numbers from 1 to n, and the second line is "2 i" followed by the numbers from 1 to n. The initial state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged, but the loop has been executed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 500. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 500) from the input. It then calculates the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and prints this sum along with `2 * n`. Additionally, for each `i` from `n` down to 1, it prints two lines: the first line is "1 i" followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the second line is "2 i" followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the initial state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged, but the specified output has been printed for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The matrix starts with all elements set to zero.
   - Two types of operations are allowed:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( j \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( j \).

2. **Solution Strategy**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to ensure that each element in the matrix is as large as possible.
   - The largest possible value for any element in the matrix is \( n \).
   - Therefore, the maximum sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \times n = n^3 \).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program initializes a matrix \( mat \) with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \) for each row.
   - It calculates the sum \( res \) using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \).
   - It prints the sum \( res \) and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - It then performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, each using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \) is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum.
   - The correct maximum sum should be \( n^3 \).

5. **Operations**:
   - The program performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, which is within the limit of \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation uses the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which is a valid permutation.
   - However, the operations do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.

6. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The operations performed by the program do not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.
   - For example, for \( n = 2 \), the matrix after the operations will be:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 \\
     1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The sum of this matrix is \( 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 \), which is not the maximum possible sum of 8.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix. The sum calculation and the operations performed do not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

Correctness: **False**
