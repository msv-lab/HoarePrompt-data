### Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The original assessment points out that the sum calculation in the program is incorrect. The program calculates the sum as `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. This formula does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the matrix.
   - For a 2x2 matrix (n=2), the maximum possible sum is 7, as shown in the example. However, the program calculates the sum as `1 * 3 + 2 * 5 = 3 + 10 = 13`, which is incorrect.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program prints operations for each row and column, but the operations are not designed to maximize the sum of the matrix. The program assigns the same permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to both rows and columns, which does not necessarily maximize the sum.
   - For a 2x2 matrix, the correct operations to achieve the maximum sum of 7 are:
     - Type 1 operation on row 1: `1 1 1 2`
     - Type 1 operation on row 2: `1 2 1 2`
     - Type 2 operation on column 1: `2 1 1 2`
   - The program's operations result in the matrix:
     ```
     1 2
     2 1
     ```
     The sum of this matrix is 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6, which is not the maximum possible sum of 7.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for every potential case. The sum calculation and the operations performed do not align with the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
