### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The matrix starts with all elements set to zero.
   - Two types of operations are allowed:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( j \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( j \).

2. **Solution Strategy**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to ensure that each element in the matrix is as large as possible.
   - The largest possible value for any element in the matrix is \( n \).
   - Therefore, the maximum sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \times n = n^3 \).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program initializes a matrix \( mat \) with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \) for each row.
   - It calculates the sum \( res \) using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \).
   - It prints the sum \( res \) and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - It then performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, each using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \) is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum.
   - The correct maximum sum should be \( n^3 \).

5. **Operations**:
   - The program performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, which is within the limit of \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation uses the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which is a valid permutation.
   - However, the operations do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.

6. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The operations performed by the program do not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.
   - For example, for \( n = 2 \), the matrix after the operations will be:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 \\
     1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The sum of this matrix is \( 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 \), which is not the maximum possible sum of 8.
   - The correct approach to maximize the sum is to fill the entire matrix with the value \( n \). This can be achieved by performing Type 1 operations on all rows and Type 2 operations on all columns, each using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix. The sum calculation and the operations performed do not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

Final: **False**
