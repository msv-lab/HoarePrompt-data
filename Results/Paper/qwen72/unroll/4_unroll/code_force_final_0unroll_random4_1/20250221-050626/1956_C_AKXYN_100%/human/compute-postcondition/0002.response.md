The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might be designed to handle a context where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is an integer. The function should return a result for each test case based on the value of `n`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500.

The function's output is not specified in the prompt, so we need to infer the most likely functionality based on common programming tasks. A typical task might involve processing each `n` and returning a list of results, one for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, and for each test case, an integer `n` between 1 and 500 is provided. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the value of `n`.**
