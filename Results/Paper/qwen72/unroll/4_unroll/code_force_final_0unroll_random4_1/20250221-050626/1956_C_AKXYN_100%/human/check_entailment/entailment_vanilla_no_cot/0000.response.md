Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes a matrix `mat` with dimensions `n x n` where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements. The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)
   \]
   This formula is correct because it calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers multiplied by their respective positions in a way that maximizes the sum. For each row and column, the sum of the permutation is maximized by using the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations, which is `2n` (since it performs `n` type 1 operations and `n` type 2 operations).

5. **Operations**: The program performs the operations in reverse order (from `n` to `1`):
   - **Type 1 Operation**: It assigns the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to each row.
   - **Type 2 Operation**: It assigns the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to each column.

   These operations ensure that each element in the matrix is set to a value from the permutation, and since the permutation is `[1, 2, ..., n]`, the sum of the matrix is maximized.

6. **Constraints**: The program ensures that the number of operations does not exceed `2n`, which is within the allowed limit.

Given the problem constraints and the requirements, the program correctly maximizes the sum of the matrix elements and outputs the operations in a valid format. Therefore, the program is correct.
