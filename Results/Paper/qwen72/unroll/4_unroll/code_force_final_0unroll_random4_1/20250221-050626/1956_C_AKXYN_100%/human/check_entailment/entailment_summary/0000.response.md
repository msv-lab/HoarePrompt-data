Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using a limited number of operations. The operations allowed are:
1. Assign a permutation to a row.
2. Assign a permutation to a column.

The maximum possible sum of the matrix is when each element in the matrix is the largest possible value, which is \( n \). Therefore, the maximum sum is \( n^2 \times n = n^3 \).

However, the provided program calculates the sum using the formula:
\[ \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \]

Let's break down this formula:
- \( (i + 1) \) is the row index (1-based).
- \( (2 \times i + 1) \) is the sum of the first \( i+1 \) odd numbers, which is \( (i + 1)^2 \).

So, the formula simplifies to:
\[ \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1)^3 \]

This sum is not equal to \( n^3 \). Instead, it is the sum of the cubes of the first \( n \) natural numbers, which is:
\[ \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2 \]

The program then prints \( \text{res} \) and \( 2n \) as the number of operations. It also prints the operations, which are:
- Type 1 operation on each row from \( n \) to 1, using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
- Type 2 operation on each column from \( n \) to 1, using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

These operations will indeed fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) in both rows and columns, but the sum of the matrix will be \( n^2 \times \frac{n+1}{2} \), not \( n^3 \).

Given the problem's requirement to maximize the sum to \( n^3 \), the program's calculated sum and the operations it performs do not achieve this goal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
