Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for every potential case. The issue lies in the logic used to calculate the sum and the operations performed. Specifically, the sum calculation and the operations do not align with the problem description.

### Case When the Program Does Not Work Correctly:
For a 2x2 matrix (n=2), the maximum possible sum is 7, as shown in the example output. However, the program calculates the sum as follows:
- For n=2, the sum is calculated as `res = 1 * 3 + 2 * 5 = 3 + 10 = 13`, which is incorrect.

The correct sum should be 7, and the operations should be designed to achieve this sum. The program's operations are also incorrect because it assigns the same permutation to both rows and columns, which does not necessarily maximize the sum.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the sum of the matrix, you should use permutations that ensure the highest possible values are placed in the matrix. For example, for a 2x2 matrix, you can achieve the maximum sum of 7 with the following operations:
- Type 1 operation on row 1: `1 1 1 2`
- Type 1 operation on row 2: `1 2 1 2`
- Type 2 operation on column 1: `2 1 1 2`

This will result in the matrix:
```
1 2
2 1
```
The sum of this matrix is 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6, which is not the maximum possible sum of 7. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
