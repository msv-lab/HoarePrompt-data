Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the total points and checking if they are even. It then calculates the maximum number of draws as the minimum of the total points divided by 2 and the sum of the points of the two lowest-scoring players. However, this approach is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Total Points Calculation:**
   - The program correctly checks if the total points `(a + b + c)` are even. If they are not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even for a valid set of games (since each game results in either 2 points being distributed or 0 points if it's a draw).

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`, which is the total number of games played (since each game contributes 2 points to the total score).
   - It then calculates `y` as `a + b`, which is the sum of the points of the two lowest-scoring players.
   - The program prints `min(x, y)` as the maximum number of draws. However, this is not always correct.

**Issues:**
- The program does not correctly account for the constraints on the number of draws. For example, if `a + b + c` is even, it does not necessarily mean that the maximum number of draws is `min(x, y)`.
- The program does not check if the points can be distributed in a way that is consistent with the rules of the game. For example, if `a + b + c` is even, it still needs to ensure that the points can be achieved through a combination of wins, losses, and draws.

**Correct Approach:**
- The total number of games played is `(a + b + c) // 2`.
- The maximum number of draws is the total number of games minus the number of wins (since each win contributes 2 points to the total score).
- The number of wins can be calculated as the difference between the total points and the sum of the points of the two lowest-scoring players, divided by 2.
- The program should also check if the points can be distributed in a way that is consistent with the rules of the game.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = a + b + c
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_games = total_points // 2
        max_wins = (c - a) // 2
        max_draws = total_games - max_wins
        if max_draws < 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the points can be distributed in a way that is consistent with the rules of the game and correctly calculates the maximum number of draws.
