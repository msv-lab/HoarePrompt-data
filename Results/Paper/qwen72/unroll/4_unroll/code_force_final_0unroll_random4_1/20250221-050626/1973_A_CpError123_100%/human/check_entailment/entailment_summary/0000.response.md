Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Sum Check**: The function checks if the sum of the scores `a + b + c` is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve an odd total score with the given scoring system (each game results in either 2 points or 2 points being split as 1 point each).

3. **Draw Calculation**:
   - The function calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This is the total number of games played, assuming each game contributes 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).
   - The function calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the maximum number of draws that the two players with the lowest scores could have had, because each draw gives 1 point to each player.

4. **Output**: The function prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the number of draws cannot exceed the total number of games played (`x`), and it also cannot exceed the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores (`y`).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the function correctly prints `0` because no games were played.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the function correctly prints `1` because one draw game is possible.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the function correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the function correctly prints `2` because two draw games are possible.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the function correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the function correctly prints `6` because six draw games are possible.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the function correctly prints `2` because two draw games are possible.

The function seems to handle all the given test cases correctly and follows the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws.

Correctness: **True**
