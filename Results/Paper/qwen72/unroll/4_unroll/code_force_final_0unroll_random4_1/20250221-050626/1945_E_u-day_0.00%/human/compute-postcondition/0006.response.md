Output State: **`pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is 0; `high` is `n - 1`; `st` is an empty set.** 

The code initializes an empty set `st`, but does not change the values of `pos`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, the initial state of these variables remains unchanged.
