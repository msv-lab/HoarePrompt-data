The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the lists `a`, `b`, `c`, and `suff`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables `i` and `n`.

The loop starts with `i` set to `n - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be initialized to `n - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9
- `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`
- `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute at least once. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be initialized to `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros**
