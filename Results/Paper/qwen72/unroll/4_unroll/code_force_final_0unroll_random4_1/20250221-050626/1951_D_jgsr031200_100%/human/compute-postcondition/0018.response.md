Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it is a constant).
   - `costs` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it is a constant).
   - `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - Additionally, `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Calculating `h`:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // (n - k + 1)`:
     - `n - k + 1` becomes `0 - k + 1` which simplifies to `1 - k`.
     - `n // (1 - k)` becomes `0 // (1 - k)`.
     - The result of `0 // (1 - k)` is 0, regardless of the value of `k` (as long as `k` is not 1, which would make the denominator zero, but we assume `k` is a valid integer).
   - `n // 1`:
     - `n // 1` becomes `0 // 1`, which is 0.
   - Therefore, `h` is the sum of 0 and 0, which is 0.

3. **Additional Condition:**
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Since `h` is 0, this condition implies that `k` must be less than or equal to 0.

4. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet is simply `print(2)`.
   - This statement will print the integer 2, regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, or `h`.

Given the above analysis, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **2**
