Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here's the analysis:

1. **Handling `n == k`**: The program correctly handles the case where `n == k` by setting up a single stall with a price of 1, which ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Handling `n < k`**: The program correctly handles the case where `n < k` by printing "NO", as it's impossible for Alice to buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **General Case**: The program attempts to set up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`. However, this approach is flawed:

   - **First Stall**: The price is set to `n - k + 1`. This means Alice will buy at most 1 jewel from the first stall, as the price is high enough to prevent her from buying more.
   - **Second Stall**: The price is set to 1. Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from this stall, which is `n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1` jewels.

   Therefore, the total number of jewels Alice buys is `1 + (k - 1) = k`, which seems correct at first glance. However, this approach fails when `k` is greater than 60, as it only sets up 2 stalls, and the problem requires that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Correct Approach**: To ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, Bob can set up `k` stalls with prices `n // k, n // k, ..., n // k` (with `k` stalls in total). This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, as each stall will have a price that allows Alice to buy one jewel from each stall until she has bought `k` jewels. If `k` is greater than 60, it is impossible to set up the required number of stalls, and the answer should be "NO".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > 60:
        print('NO')
        return
    print('YES')
    print(k)
    for i in range(k):
        price = n // k
        if i == k - 1:
            price = n - (k - 1) * (n // k)
        print(price, end=' ')
    print()
```

This corrected program ensures that:
- If `k` is greater than 60, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES" and sets up `k` stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The last stall's price is adjusted to ensure the total number of jewels bought is exactly `k`.
