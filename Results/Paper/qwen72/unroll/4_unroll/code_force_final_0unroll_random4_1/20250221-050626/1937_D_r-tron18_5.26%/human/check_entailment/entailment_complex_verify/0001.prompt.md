You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

It processes the string to compute a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element `ans[i]` is determined based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. The function prints the elements of `ans` and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `s1` remains unchanged, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters, `totalOne` is 0, `preOne` is an empty list, and `suffZero` is a list of length `n + 1` containing cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters from the end of the string.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball is placed on a cell and moves left or right based on the character in the cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either the left or right border.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each placing the pinball on a different cell and calculating the time it takes to leave the grid.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is used to calculate the difference between elements in an array.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the grid and calculates the time for each pinball to leave the grid.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(arr, times)` returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at index `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
   - This function is used to calculate the time taken based on the accumulated positions of '>' and '<' characters.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
   - `preOne` is the accumulated sum of indices of '>' characters.
   - `suffZero` is a list used to accumulate the positions of '<' characters from the right.
   - `ans` is the list to store the results for each cell.

5. **Processing the Grid:**
   - The program iterates over the grid from right to left.
   - For each cell, it checks if the character is '>' or '<'.
   - If the character is '>', it calculates the time using the accumulated sums and updates the `preOne` and `totalOne`.
   - If the character is '<', it calculates the time using the accumulated sums and updates the `suffZero`.

6. **Time Calculation:**
   - The time calculation involves using the accumulated sums to determine the number of steps the pinball takes to leave the grid.
   - The logic for calculating the time is based on the relative positions of '>' and '<' characters and their accumulated sums.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each cell in the grid.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the positions of '>' and '<' characters and uses accumulated sums to calculate the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
- The logic for handling the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball is consistent with the problem description.
- The use of `accumulate` and the `func_1` function helps in efficiently calculating the required time for each cell.

However, there are a few potential issues:
- The program does not handle the input and output for multiple test cases.
- The function `func_1` is not defined to handle the case where `times` is greater than the length of `arr`, which could lead to out-of-bounds errors.
- The logic for calculating the time in `func_2` is complex and may have edge cases that are not handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the logic and the potential issues with handling multiple test cases and out-of-bounds errors, the program is not guaranteed to be correct in all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
