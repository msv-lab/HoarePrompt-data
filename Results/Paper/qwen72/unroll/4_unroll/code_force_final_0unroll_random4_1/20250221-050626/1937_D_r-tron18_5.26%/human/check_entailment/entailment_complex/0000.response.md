### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a one-dimensional grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. A pinball is placed on each cell, and it moves according to the direction of the character in the cell. The character in the cell is then inverted after the pinball moves. The goal is to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(arr, times)`**:
     - This function calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
     - It is used to compute the cumulative sum differences in `func_2`.

   - **`func_2(s1, n)`**:
     - This function processes the string `s1` to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell.
     - **Initialization**:
       - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
       - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
       - `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters.
       - `suffZero` is a list that will store cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters from the end of the string.
       - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to 0, which will store the results.
     - **Loop**:
       - The loop iterates from the last cell to the first cell.
       - For each cell, it checks the character:
         - If the character is '>', it calculates the time using the cumulative sums and updates `ans[i]`.
         - If the character is '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time using the cumulative sums and updates `ans[i]`.
       - After processing each cell, it prints the results in `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `pre` correctly stores the indices of '>' characters.
     - `totalOne` correctly counts the number of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` correctly stores the cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters.
     - `suffZero` is initialized to `[0]` and will be updated with cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters.
     - `ans` is correctly initialized to a list of zeros of length `n`.

   - **Loop Logic**:
     - The loop iterates from the last cell to the first cell, which is appropriate for processing the cumulative sums from the end.
     - For each cell, the function correctly handles the two cases (character is '>' or '<') and updates `ans[i]` based on the cumulative sums.
     - The cumulative sums are used to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid, which aligns with the problem description.

   - **Output**:
     - The function prints the results in `ans` after processing all cells, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell, based on the given problem description. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to achieve this, and the loop logic correctly handles the different cases for '<' and '>' characters.

Correctness: **True**
