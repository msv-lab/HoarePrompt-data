The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The state of `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop, which is the default behavior of `range(n)`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 0**
