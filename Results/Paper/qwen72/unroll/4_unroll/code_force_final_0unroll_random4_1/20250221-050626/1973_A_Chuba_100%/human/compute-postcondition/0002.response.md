Output State: **The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers from the input, checks if their sum is odd, and if so, prints `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates a result based on the formula provided and prints the result. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged.**
