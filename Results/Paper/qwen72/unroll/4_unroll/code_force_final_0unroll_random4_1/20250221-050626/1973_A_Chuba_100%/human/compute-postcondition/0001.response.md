The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` does not affect the loop's execution directly, but they are part of the initial state provided.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, typically used when the loop variable is not needed inside the loop body. It starts at 0 and increments up to `t-1`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30**
