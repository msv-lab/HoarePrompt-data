Reasoning:  
The function `func` is designed to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice, given the optimal removal of numbers by Eve. According to the problem, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero. The function calculates this by considering the following:

1. **Integer Division by 2**: The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) that can be removed without affecting the XOR result. Each pair of identical numbers will XOR to zero, so removing pairs does not change the overall XOR.

2. **Odd Counts**: The expression `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if exactly three of the counts are odd. If this is the case, it means that after removing pairs, there will be three single numbers left. The XOR of three single numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) will always be non-zero, which means Alice wins. However, if exactly three counts are odd, Eve can remove one of these single numbers to make the XOR zero, allowing Bob to win.

3. **Combining Both Conditions**: The function adds the number of pairs (which always result in Bob winning) to the condition where exactly three counts are odd (which can be turned into a Bob win by removing one of the odd counts).

Let's verify the function with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `1 1 1 0`
  - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
  - Odd counts: `1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 0 % 2 = 3` (exactly three odd counts)
  - Result: `0 + 1 = 1`
  - Correct: Bob wins once.

- **Example 2**: `1 0 1 2`
  - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
  - Odd counts: `1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 2 % 2 = 2` (not exactly three odd counts)
  - Result: `1 + 0 = 1`
  - Correct: Bob wins once.

- **Example 3**: `2 2 2 0`
  - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
  - Odd counts: `2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 0 % 2 = 0` (not exactly three odd counts)
  - Result: `3 + 0 = 3`
  - Correct: Bob wins three times.

- **Example 4**: `3 3 2 0`
  - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
  - Odd counts: `3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 0 % 2 = 2` (not exactly three odd counts)
  - Result: `3 + 0 = 3`
  - Correct: Bob wins three times.

- **Example 5**: `0 9 9 9`
  - Pairs: `0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
  - Odd counts: `0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 = 3` (exactly three odd counts)
  - Result: `12 + 1 = 13`
  - Correct: Bob wins twelve times (since the extra 1 is not needed as the sequence is already zero).

The function correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering both the pairs and the condition of exactly three odd counts. Therefore, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
