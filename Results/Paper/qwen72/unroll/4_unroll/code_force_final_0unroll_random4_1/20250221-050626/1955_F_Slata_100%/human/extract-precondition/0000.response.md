Precondition: **The function takes no input parameters, but the problem description implies that the input will be provided in the form of multiple test cases, each containing four integers p_i (0 \le p_i \le 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence. The number of test cases t is an integer where 1 \le t \le 10^4.**
