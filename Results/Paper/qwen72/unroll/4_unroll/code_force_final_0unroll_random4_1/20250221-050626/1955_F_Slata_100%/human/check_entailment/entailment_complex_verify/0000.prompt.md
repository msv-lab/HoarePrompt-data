You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters, but the problem description implies that the input will be provided in the form of multiple test cases, each containing four integers p_i (0 \le p_i \le 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence. The number of test cases t is an integer where 1 \le t \le 10^4.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: The loop will execute for a total of t iterations, where t is the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the output will be the sum of the integer division of each of the four input integers by 2, plus 1 if exactly three of the input integers are odd. The state of the variables a, b, c, and d will be reset for each new test case, and the loop variable i will increment from 0 to t-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing four integers (a, b, c, d) representing counts. It prints the sum of the integer division of each count by 2, plus 1 if exactly three of the counts are odd. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables (a, b, c, d) are no longer relevant, and the loop variable `i` has incremented from 0 to t-1, where t is the number of test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not account for the optimal removal strategy when the counts of the numbers are such that the XOR of the remaining sequence can be zero. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
0 0 0 4
```
The sequence consists of four 4s. The XOR of four 4s is:
```
4 ^ 4 ^ 4 ^ 4 = 0
```
So, Bob wins initially. However, if Eve removes one 4, the sequence becomes:
```
4 ^ 4 ^ 4 = 4
```
Now, Alice wins. If Eve removes another 4, the sequence becomes:
```
4 ^ 4 = 0
```
Bob wins again. If Eve removes another 4, the sequence becomes:
```
4
```
Alice wins. Finally, if Eve removes the last 4, the sequence is empty, and Bob wins.

Thus, Bob can win 3 times in this case. However, the program will output:
```
2
```
because it only considers the number of pairs of each type and does not handle the case where the count of a single number is even and greater than 2. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
