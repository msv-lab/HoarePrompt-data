Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `tests` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop has executed. The loop prints 'NO' if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if all characters in `c` are present in both `a` and `b`. It prints 'YES' if at least one character in `c` is not present in either `a` or `b`.
