The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the variable `tests`. For the loop to execute, `tests` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. The state of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` does not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
