Postcondition: **The function `func_1` is intended to solve the problem described, but the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept an integer `X` and possibly other parameters to handle multiple test cases. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, X):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and `X` is the target number of increasing subsequences (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). `x` is an input integer, and `x` is not equal to 2. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0.**
