Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case. It then reads `n` lines of input for each test case, which is appropriate for handling the input as described in the problem statement.

2. **Shape Detection**: The program creates a list `k` to store the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. This is a reasonable approach to identify the pattern of '1's in the grid.

3. **Shape Identification**: The program checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal. This is insufficient for determining the shape:
   - For a square, all elements of `k` should be equal.
   - For a triangle, the elements should follow the pattern `1, 3, 5, ...` or `5, 3, 1, ...`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the list `k` if the first two elements are equal, which is incorrect. The problem statement requires the program to print "SQUARE" if the shape is a square and "TRIANGLE" if the shape is a triangle.

5. **Additional Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the grid might be a triangle with more than two rows.
   - The program does not handle the case where the grid might be a square with more than two rows.
   - The program does not check the pattern of '1's for a triangle or a square beyond the first two rows.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect. The original assessment accurately points out the flaws in the program's logic and output format.

Final: **False**
