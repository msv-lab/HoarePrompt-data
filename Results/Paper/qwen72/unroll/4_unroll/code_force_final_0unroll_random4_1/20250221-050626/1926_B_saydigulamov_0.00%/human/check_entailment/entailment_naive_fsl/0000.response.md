Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify the shape (triangle or square) based on the input grid. It only appends the count of '1's in each row to a list `k` and checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal. This logic is insufficient to determine the shape correctly for all cases. For example, consider the following input:

```
2
3
001
011
111
3
111
111
111
```

For the first test case, the grid is:
```
001
011
111
```
The program will append the counts `[1, 2, 3]` to `k`, and since `k[0]` (1) is not equal to `k[1]` (2), it will not print anything, which is incorrect because the shape is a triangle.

For the second test case, the grid is:
```
111
111
111
```
The program will append the counts `[3, 3, 3]` to `k`, and since `k[0]` (3) is equal to `k[1]` (3), it will print the list `[3, 3, 3]`, which is incorrect because the shape is a square and the output should be "SQUARE".

The program fails to correctly identify the shape in both of these cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.
