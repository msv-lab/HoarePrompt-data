You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a grid represented as a list of lists, where each inner list contains n characters '0' or '1', and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `a` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and then `n` lines of input representing a grid. If any of these grids contain exactly two rows with the same number of '1's, it prints a list of the counts of '1's in those rows. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `grid`, a list of lists containing characters '0' or '1', and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. It returns "triangle" if the grid contains a triangle that includes all '1's, and "square" if the grid contains a square that includes all '1's, for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
