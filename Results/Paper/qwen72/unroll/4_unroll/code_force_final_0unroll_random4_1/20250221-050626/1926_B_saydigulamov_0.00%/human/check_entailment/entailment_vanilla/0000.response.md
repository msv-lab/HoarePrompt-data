Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which is the size of the grid, and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.

2. **Shape Detection**: The program creates a list `k` to store the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. This is a good approach to identify the pattern of '1's in the grid.

3. **Shape Identification**: The program checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal. If they are, it prints the list `k`. This is incorrect because:
   - It does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement.
   - It only checks the first two elements of `k`, which is not sufficient to determine the shape. For a square, all elements of `k` should be equal. For a triangle, the elements should follow the pattern `1, 3, 5, ...` or `5, 3, 1, ...`.

4. **Output**: The program does not produce the correct output format as specified in the problem statement. It should print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" for each test case.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
