Precondition: **The function should be called with a grid represented as a list of lists, where each inner list contains n characters '0' or '1', and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.**
