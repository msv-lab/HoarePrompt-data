Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case according to the rules of the game, and outputs the correct number of players who could have the ball at the end of the game, along with their numbers in increasing order.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1` reads a line from the input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2` converts the result of `func_1` to an integer.
   - `func_3` splits the result of `func_1` into a list of integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions if `c` is '?'.
   - If the direction is '0', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set.
   - If the direction is '1', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.

3. **Handling Player Numbering:**
   - If the set `ans` contains `0` (which represents the last player in the circle), it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set to correct the player numbering.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players in the set `ans`.
   - It prints the players' numbers in increasing order.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that the output is accurate and meets the requirements.
