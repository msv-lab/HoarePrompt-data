The value `n` is added to the set `ans`. Since `ans` is a set, it will only add `n` if `n` is not already present in the set. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. The operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`, repeated `m` times, excluding the value 0, are still valid.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` is a set containing all possible values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`, repeated `m` times, excluding the value 0, and now also includes the value `n`.**
