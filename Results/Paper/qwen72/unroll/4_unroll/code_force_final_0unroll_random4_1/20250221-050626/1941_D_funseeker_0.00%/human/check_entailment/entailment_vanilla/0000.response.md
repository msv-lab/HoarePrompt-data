### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` and processes it with functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` reads a line from the input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2` converts the result of `func_1` to an integer.
   - `func_3` splits the result of `func_1` by spaces and maps each part to an integer, returning a list of integers.

2. **Main Function (`func_4`):**
   - The function reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x` who has the ball.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` (which can be '0', '1', or '?').
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible new positions of the ball.
   - If the direction is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to be the set of all possible positions in `temp`.
   - If `0` is in `ans`, it removes `0` and adds `n` to `ans` to handle the case where the position wraps around to the last player.
   - Finally, it prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and the sorted list of these players.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown ('?') by considering both possible directions.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the position wraps around the circle by converting `0` to `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and the sorted list of these players, which matches the required output format.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws, considering the given constraints and input format. It handles all the specified cases, including unknown directions and wrapping around the circle.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
