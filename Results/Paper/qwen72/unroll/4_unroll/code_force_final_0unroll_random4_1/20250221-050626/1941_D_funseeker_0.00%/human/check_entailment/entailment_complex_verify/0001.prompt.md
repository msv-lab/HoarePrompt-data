You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf and Bernard decided to play a game with their friends. n people stand
in a circle and start throwing a ball to each other. They are numbered from 1
to n in the clockwise order.

Let's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his
neighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player
y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be
made to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the
clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2
to 5 is 4 .

Initially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered
clockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance
of r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if
there are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it
a distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player
(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An
illustration of this example is shown below.

The game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain
stopped, the guys gathered again to continue. However, no one could remember
who had the ball. As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each
of the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or
counterclockwise).

Rudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,
calculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \le n \le
1000 , 1 \le m \le 1000 , 1 \le x \le n ) — the number of players, the number
of throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,
respectively.

The next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them
contains an integer r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) — the distance at which the i
-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':

  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, 
  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, 
  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

It is guaranteed that the sum n \cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test
cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the number of players k (1 \le k \le n ) who could
have the ball at the end of the game.

In the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \le b_i \le n ) — the numbers of the
players in increasing order. All numbers must be different.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns the first line of input from the user, with any trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads the first line of input from the user (via standard input) and returns it with any trailing whitespace removed. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external variables. After the function concludes, the program has the first line of user input available as a string with trailing whitespace stripped.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer value that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`. After the function concludes, the program state is unchanged except for the returned integer value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of integers derived from splitting the string returned by `func_1()` and converting each split part into an integer.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.

    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}

        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:

        ans = temp
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` is a set containing all possible values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`, repeated `m` times.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)

If `0` is in `ans`, then `0` is excluded from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where ans is the set containing all unique values generated by the operations (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for each q in the initial set and each r and c returned by func_1(), repeated m times, with 0 excluded and n added if 0 is present)

    #This is printed: [values in ans] (where ans is a set containing all possible values generated by the operations (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for each q in the initial set and each r and c returned by func_1(), repeated m times, and if 0 is in ans, it is replaced by n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns no values. It operates on three integer variables `n`, `m`, and `x` (where 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n) that are obtained from the function `func_3`. The function generates a set `ans` of all possible values derived from the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `{x}` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`, repeated `m` times. If `0` is present in `ans`, it is replaced by `n`. The function then prints the number of unique values in `ans` and the values themselves. The variables `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`) to read input from `sys.stdin`.
   - `func_1` reads a line and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2` converts the result of `func_1` to an integer.
   - `func_3` splits the result of `func_1` by spaces and maps each part to an integer, returning a list.
   - `func_4` is the main function that processes each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp` for each player `q` in `ans`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp` for each player `q` in `ans`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to be the set of all possible positions in `temp`.

3. **Adjusting for 1-based Indexing:**
   - Since the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set to adjust for 1-based indexing.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Input Handling:**
  - The input handling is correct and follows the problem description.
  - The use of `sys.stdin` and the helper functions ensures efficient reading of input.

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic for handling each throw is correct. It correctly considers both possible directions when `c` is '?'.
  - The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are tracked without duplicates.
  - The adjustment for 1-based indexing is correctly handled by checking for `0` and replacing it with `n`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `c` is '0' or '1' by only considering the specified direction.
  - It also correctly handles the case where `c` is '?', considering both directions.

- **Output Format:**
  - The output format matches the problem description, printing the number of possible players and then the sorted list of player numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
