The function `read` is expected to read input data from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with three integers n, m, x (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ x ≤ n) representing the number of players, the number of throws, and the initial player with the ball, respectively. This is followed by m lines, each containing an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?') indicating the distance of the throw and the direction (clockwise, counterclockwise, or unknown).
