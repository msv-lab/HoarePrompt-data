### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`) to read input from `sys.stdin`.
   - `func_1` reads a line and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2` converts the result of `func_1` to an integer.
   - `func_3` splits the result of `func_1` by spaces and maps each part to an integer, returning a list.
   - `func_4` is the main function that processes each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp` for each player `q` in `ans`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp` for each player `q` in `ans`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to be the set of all possible positions in `temp`.

3. **Adjusting for 1-based Indexing:**
   - Since the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set to adjust for 1-based indexing.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Input Handling:**
  - The input handling is correct and follows the problem description.
  - The use of `sys.stdin` and the helper functions ensures efficient reading of input.

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic for handling each throw is correct. It correctly considers both possible directions when `c` is '?'.
  - The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are tracked without duplicates.
  - The adjustment for 1-based indexing is correctly handled by checking for `0` and replacing it with `n`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `c` is '0' or '1' by only considering the specified direction.
  - It also correctly handles the case where `c` is '?', considering both directions.

- **Output Format:**
  - The output format matches the problem description, printing the number of possible players and then the sorted list of player numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
