To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the loop step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `m` times.
   - In each iteration, `func_1()` is called, which returns a string that is split into `r` and `c`.
   - `r` is converted to an integer.
   - A temporary set `temp` is initialized.
   - For each element `q` in the set `ans`:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.
   - After processing all elements in `ans`, `ans` is updated to `temp`.

3. **Effect of the Loop:**
   - The set `ans` is updated in each iteration based on the values of `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`.
   - The values in `ans` are modified by adding and subtracting `r` and taking the result modulo `n`.

4. **Final State:**
   - After `m` iterations, `ans` will contain all possible values that can be generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`.

Given the initial state and the loop, the final state of `ans` will be a set of integers that are the results of all possible additions and subtractions of `r` (modulo `n`) for each `q` in the initial set, repeated `m` times.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `ans` is a set containing all possible values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`, repeated `m` times.**
