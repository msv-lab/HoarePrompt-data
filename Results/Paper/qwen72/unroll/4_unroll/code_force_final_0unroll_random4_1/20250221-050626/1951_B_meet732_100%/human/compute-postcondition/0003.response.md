The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Given that `a` is a list of `n` integers where `2 <= n <= 10^5`, the loop will definitely execute at least once. However, for the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to 0, and `n` must be at least 1.

State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 <= n <= 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`; `ind` is an empty list; `c` is 0; `i` is 0; `n` is at least 2**
