### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` cows with distinct Cowdeforces ratings.
   - The tournament is a single-elimination style where the winner of each match proceeds to the next.
   - We can swap the position of our cow (index `k`) with another cow once to maximize the number of matches our cow wins.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of Cowdeforces ratings `l`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the list `l` to determine the maximum number of wins for cow `k`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the list of ratings `a` as input.
   - It extracts the rating of our cow `x` from the list.
   - It initializes an empty list `ind` to store the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - It also initializes a counter `c` to count the number of such higher-rated cows.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and appends the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x` to `ind` and increments `c`.
   - The loop breaks if `c` reaches 2, meaning it has found two cows with higher ratings.

4. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - **Case 1: No higher-rated cows (`ind` is empty):**
     - This means our cow has the highest rating and will win all matches.
     - The function returns `n - 1` (since there are `n - 1` matches).
   - **Case 2: One higher-rated cow (`len(ind) == 1`):**
     - If the higher-rated cow is at index 0, our cow can only win `k - 1` matches.
     - If the higher-rated cow is after our cow, our cow can win `ind[0] - 1` matches.
     - If the higher-rated cow is before our cow, our cow can win `max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)` matches.
   - **Case 3: Two higher-rated cows (`len(ind) == 2`):**
     - If the first higher-rated cow is at index 0, our cow can win `min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)` matches.
     - If our cow is after the second higher-rated cow, our cow can win `max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])` matches.
     - Otherwise, our cow can win `max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])` matches.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies the indices of the two highest-rated cows that are higher than our cow.
   - It then determines the optimal number of matches our cow can win based on the relative positions of these higher-rated cows.
   - The logic for each case is sound and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.
