Correctness: **True**

The program correctly handles the problem by considering two scenarios for each test case:

1. **Buying all yogurts at the regular price**: This is calculated as `a * n`.
2. **Buying as many yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the rest at the regular price**: This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`, where `n // 2` gives the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price, and `n % 2` gives the number of yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price if `n` is odd.

The program then prints the minimum of these two costs for each test case. This approach ensures that the minimum cost is always found, and the program handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
