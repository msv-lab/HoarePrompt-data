The function `func` is described with parameter constraints but does not explicitly list the parameters in its definition. Based on the provided constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, including `t` (the number of test cases), and for each test case, it accepts `n`, `a`, and `b`. The constraints indicate that `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

However, since the function definition does not specify these parameters, we will assume that they are provided in some form, such as a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple or list containing `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of test cases, where each test case includes integers `n`, `a`, and `b` with the constraints 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
