### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - The program then checks if `n` is greater than 1. This is necessary because the promotion only applies when buying two or more yogurts.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost if Maxim buys all `n` yogurts at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: This is the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buys any remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.

4. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `n == 1`, the program directly prints the regular price `a` because the promotion does not apply to a single yogurt.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n == 1`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `n` is even or odd, as `n // 2` gives the number of pairs and `n % 2` gives the number of remaining yogurts.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, considering both the regular price and the promotion price. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: True**
