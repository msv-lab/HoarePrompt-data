### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.
   - This is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Edge Case for Single Yogurt**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `a` because Maxim can only buy one yogurt, and there is no promotion to consider.
   - This is correct because the minimum cost for one yogurt is simply the price of one yogurt.
   - The original assessment is accurate in this regard.

3. **General Case for Multiple Yogurts**:
   - The program calculates two potential costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost if Maxim buys all `n` yogurts at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and any remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.
   - The original assessment correctly describes the logic and the formula used for `ans2`.

4. **Correctness of Cost Calculation**:
   - `ans1` is straightforward and correct.
   - `ans2` is calculated by:
     - `b * (n // 2)`: This is the cost for buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
     - `a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost for buying any remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
   - The sum of these two parts gives the total cost if Maxim uses the promotion as much as possible.
   - The original assessment is accurate in this regard.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the correct approach to solving the problem.
   - The original assessment is accurate in this regard.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program does not introduce any new variables that could interfere with the calculations.
- The program handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound and follows the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, and prints the result for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final:
**True**
