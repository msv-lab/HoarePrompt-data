The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer input by the user, and `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is the number of test cases provided in the input. Each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n×n matrix. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
