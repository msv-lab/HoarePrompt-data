Let's break down the print statement step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` is an integer input by the user. The precondition states that `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`.

2. **Expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`**:
   - This expression calculates a value based on the input `n`.
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is a known formula for the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - The result of this expression will be an integer because the division is integer division (`//`).

3. **Expression `2 * n`**:
   - This expression simply multiplies `n` by 2.
   - The result will be an integer.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement will output the results of the two expressions separated by a comma.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
- The first part of the output is the result of the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
- The second part of the output is the result of the expression `2 * n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can describe the output in terms of `n`:

Output: **n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the integer input by the user)**
