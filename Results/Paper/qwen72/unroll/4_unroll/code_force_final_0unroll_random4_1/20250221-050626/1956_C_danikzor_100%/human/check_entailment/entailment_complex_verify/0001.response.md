### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - The sum of the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Since we are filling each row and each column with this permutation, the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - The provided program uses the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) to calculate the maximum sum. This formula is incorrect for the maximum sum. The correct formula should be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Operations:**
   - The program performs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 2 operation with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix is assigned the maximum possible value from the permutation, which is \( n \).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It then prints the operations, which are correctly formatted and within the allowed limit.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
  - The function reads an integer `n` from the user input, which represents the size of the matrix.
  - The function prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
  - The function then prints the operations for each row and column.

- **State Inside Function:**
  - The function correctly reads `n` and prints the number of operations as `2 * n`.
  - The function prints the operations in the correct format, with each operation using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

- **State After Function Call:**
  - The function does not return any value and does not modify the input or any external state.
  - The loop continues to the next test case until all test cases are processed.

### Final Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identified that the formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect. The correct formula should be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
- The operations and the output format are correct and within the allowed limit.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the wrong formula for the maximum sum.

Final: **False**
