Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user input, prints a tuple containing the values `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and `2 * n`, and then prints two lines for each integer `i` from 1 to `n`. Each line starts with either `1` or `2`, followed by `i`, and then the integers from `n` to `1` in descending order. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input or any external state. **
