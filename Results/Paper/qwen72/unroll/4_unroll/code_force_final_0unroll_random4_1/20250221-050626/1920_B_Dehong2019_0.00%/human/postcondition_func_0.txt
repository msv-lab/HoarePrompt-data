The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x`, and an array `a` of integers. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` from input, sorts the array `a` in descending order, and calculates a value `ans` based on the given transformations. The final value of `ans` for each test case is printed. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are reset for each test case, and their values are not retained between iterations. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5, and the values of `a_i` remain within the specified range.
