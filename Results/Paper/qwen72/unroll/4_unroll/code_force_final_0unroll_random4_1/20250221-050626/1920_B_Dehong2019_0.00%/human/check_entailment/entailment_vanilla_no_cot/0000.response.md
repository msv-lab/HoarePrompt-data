Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game between Alice and Bob. Here are the issues:

1. **Alice's Strategy**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. The current implementation sorts the array in descending order, which means Alice is removing the largest elements instead of the smallest ones.

2. **Bob's Strategy**:
   - Bob should multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum. The current implementation incorrectly multiplies the largest elements by -1, which is not optimal.

3. **Combined Strategy**:
   - The program does not correctly combine Alice's and Bob's strategies. It should consider the optimal removal of elements by Alice and the optimal multiplication of elements by Bob.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Sort the array in ascending order to facilitate Alice's and Bob's optimal moves.

2. **Alice's Move**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements from the array to maximize the sum.

3. **Bob's Move**:
   - Bob should multiply the smallest `x` elements by -1 to minimize the sum. If there are negative elements, Bob should focus on them. If there are no negative elements, Bob should consider the smallest positive elements.

4. **Calculate the Final Sum**:
   - After Alice's and Bob's moves, calculate the sum of the remaining elements.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        # Alice removes the smallest k elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob multiplies the smallest x elements by -1
        for i in range(x):
            if i < len(a):
                a[i] = -a[i]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        ans = sum(a)
        
        print(ans)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Sorting**:
   - The array is sorted in ascending order to facilitate the optimal moves.

2. **Alice's Move**:
   - Alice removes the smallest `k` elements by slicing the array from index `k` to the end.

3. **Bob's Move**:
   - Bob multiplies the smallest `x` elements by -1. This is done by iterating over the first `x` elements of the array and negating them.

4. **Final Sum**:
   - The sum of the remaining elements is calculated and printed.

This corrected program should handle the problem correctly and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
