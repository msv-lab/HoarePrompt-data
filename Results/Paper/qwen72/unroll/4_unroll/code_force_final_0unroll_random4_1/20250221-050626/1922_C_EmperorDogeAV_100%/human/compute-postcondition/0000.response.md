Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely. `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `prog_cities` with `n-1` elements, all set to 0. The initial state of `cities` and `n` remains unchanged. The new list `prog_cities` is now a list of zeros with a length of `n-1`.
