### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the positions of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads each query and processes it.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is designed to compute the minimum cost to travel to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes a list `prog_cities` of size `n-1` to store the costs.
   - For each city `i` (except the last one), it calculates the cost to travel to the closest city:
     - `back` is set to a very large negative number if `i` is the first city.
     - `forward` is set to a very large positive number if `i` is the last city.
     - If the city immediately after `i` is closer than the city immediately before `i`, the cost is 1.
     - Otherwise, the cost is the absolute difference between the city at index `i` and the city immediately before it.
   - The function returns the list `prog_cities`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for both the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum of the forward costs.
   - `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum of the backward costs, which is calculated after reversing the `cities` list and calling `func_1` again.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`:
     - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum.
     - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum.
   - The cost is calculated as the difference between the prefix sums at the appropriate indices.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Closest City Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the closest city cost. Specifically, it should always return 1 for the closest city, but it sometimes returns the absolute difference between the city at index `i` and the city immediately before it, which is incorrect.
  - The correct logic should be to always return 1 for the closest city cost, as the problem states that the closest city is unique and the cost to travel to the closest city is always 1.

- **Backward Calculation:**
  - The backward calculation is also incorrect because it reverses the list and then applies the same logic, which does not correctly handle the closest city cost.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if i == 0:
            back = -99999999999999999999
        else:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i == n - 1:
            forward = 999999999999999999
        else:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = 1  # Always 1 for the closest city
    return prog_cities
```

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program as given is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the closest city cost. The function `func_1` should always return 1 for the closest city cost, but it sometimes returns the absolute difference, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
