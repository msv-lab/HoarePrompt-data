Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city, but it incorrectly assigns the distance to the closest city rather than the index of the closest city. This leads to incorrect results in the main logic where the program tries to use these distances to compute the minimum number of coins required for travel.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The program will incorrectly compute the distances and thus the prefix sums, leading to incorrect results for the queries. The correct approach should involve storing the index of the closest city, not the distance, and using this information to compute the minimum number of coins required for travel.
