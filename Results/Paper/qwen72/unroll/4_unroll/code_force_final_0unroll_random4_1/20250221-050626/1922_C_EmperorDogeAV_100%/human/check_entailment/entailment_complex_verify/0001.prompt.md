You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    return prog_cities
    #The program returns the list `prog_cities` which contains n-1 integers, where each integer is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city immediately before it, depending on whether the city immediately after it is closer than the city immediately before it.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of city positions `cities` and an integer `n`, and returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers. Each integer in `prog_cities` represents the distance to the closest neighboring city for each city in the input list, except the last city. If the city immediately after a given city is closer than the city immediately before it, the value is 1; otherwise, the value is the absolute difference between the city at index `i` and the city immediately before it. The final state of the program is that `prog_cities` contains these calculated distances.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and the list of city coordinates `cities`.
   - It then reads the number of queries `m` and processes each query.

2. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `back` and `forward` to very large and very small values, respectively, to handle edge cases where a city might be the first or last in the list.
   - For each city, it updates `back` and `forward` to the coordinates of the previous and next cities, respectively.
   - It then compares the distances to the previous and next cities and assigns the cost to `prog_cities[i]`:
     - If the next city is closer, it assigns 1 (indicating a 1-coin travel to the closest city).
     - Otherwise, it assigns the distance to the previous city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates two prefix sum arrays, `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`, for forward and backward travel costs, respectively.
   - `pref_sum_f` is calculated for the original city list.
   - `pref_sum_b` is calculated for the reversed city list and then reversed back to align with the original indices.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program determines the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum array `pref_sum_f` to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum array `pref_sum_b` to calculate the cost.

### Issues:
- **Closest City Calculation**:
  - The function `func_1` has a logical error in the assignment of `prog_cities[i]`. It should always assign 1 if the next city is closer, and the distance to the next city if the previous city is closer.
  - The current implementation assigns 1 if the next city is closer, but incorrectly assigns the distance to the previous city otherwise. It should assign the distance to the next city.

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
  - The prefix sum arrays are correctly calculated, but the logic in `func_1` needs to be fixed to ensure the correct values are assigned to `prog_cities`.

- **Query Processing**:
  - The query processing logic is correct, but it relies on the incorrect values from `func_1`.

### Corrected Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1  # Cost to travel to the next city
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])  # Distance to the next city
    return prog_cities
```

### Conclusion:
- The original program has a logical error in the `func_1` function, which affects the correctness of the prefix sum arrays and, consequently, the query results.
- After correcting the `func_1` function, the program should work correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**
