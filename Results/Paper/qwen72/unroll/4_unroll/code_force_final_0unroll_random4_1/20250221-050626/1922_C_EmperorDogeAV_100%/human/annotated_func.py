#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city immediately before it, depending on whether the city immediately after it is closer than the city immediately before it.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns the list `prog_cities` which contains n-1 integers, where each integer is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city immediately before it, depending on whether the city immediately after it is closer than the city immediately before it.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of city positions `cities` and an integer `n`, and returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers. Each integer in `prog_cities` represents the distance to the closest neighboring city for each city in the input list, except the last city. If the city immediately after a given city is closer than the city immediately before it, the value is 1; otherwise, the value is the absolute difference between the city at index `i` and the city immediately before it. The final state of the program is that `prog_cities` contains these calculated distances.
