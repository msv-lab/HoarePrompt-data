To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `r` is a list containing `t` integers.
- Each integer in the list `r` represents the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints for each test case.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*r, sep='\n')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` function is used to print the elements of the list `r`.
- The `*r` syntax is used to unpack the list `r`, meaning each element of the list will be passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
- The `sep='\n'` argument specifies that each element should be separated by a newline character, so each element will be printed on a new line.

### Output:
- The `print` statement will print each integer in the list `r` on a new line.
- Since the exact values of the integers in `r` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `r`.

Output: **[r[0]]
[r[1]]
...
[r[t-1]] (where each [r[i]] is the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints for the i-th test case)**

This format ensures that each element of the list `r` is printed on a new line, and the description clearly indicates that each element represents the number of valid integers `k` for the corresponding test case.
