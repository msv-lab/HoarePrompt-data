### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and the number of constraints, `n`, for each test case.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a list `r` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a set `cx` to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`) to represent the maximum possible value of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - It initializes `bx` to a small value (`-1`) to represent the minimum possible value of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`. This ensures that `bx` is the smallest value that `k` can be.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`. This ensures that `ax` is the largest value that `k` can be.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`. This correctly avoids the values that `k` must not be.

4. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, there are no valid values for `k`, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`. This is correct because no integer can satisfy such constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`. This is done by iterating over the set `cx` and counting the values that fall within the range.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines, which matches the expected output format.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **Initialization of `ax` and `bx`**:
  - `ax` is initialized to a large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`), which is appropriate for type 2 constraints.
  - `bx` is initialized to a small value (`-1`), which is appropriate for type 1 constraints.

- **Constraint Processing**:
  - The program correctly updates `bx` and `ax` based on the type 1 and type 2 constraints.
  - Type 3 constraints are correctly added to the set `cx`.

- **Range Calculation**:
  - The program correctly calculates the range of valid `k` values as `ax - bx + 1`.
  - It then correctly subtracts the count of values in `cx` that fall within this range.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `bx` is greater than `ax` by appending `0` to the result list.
  - It also correctly handles the case where there are no type 3 constraints by simply calculating the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem. It correctly calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
