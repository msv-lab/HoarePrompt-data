Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Constraints Processing**:
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (1000000000.0 + 7) and `bx` to -1. These variables will hold the minimum upper bound and the maximum lower bound, respectively.
   - For each constraint, it updates `bx` if the constraint is of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), and `ax` if the constraint is of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x).
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (k must be not equal to x), it adds `x` to the set `cx` which keeps track of all the values that k cannot be.
3. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends 0 to the result list `r` because it is impossible for k to satisfy both conditions.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers k by subtracting the number of invalid values in the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in that range (`ax - bx + 1`).
4. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
