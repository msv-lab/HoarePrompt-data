Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then `n` pairs of integers (a, x) from the input, where `a` indicates the type of constraint (1 for k ≥ x, 2 for k ≤ x, and 3 for k ≠ x) and `x` is the value for the constraint. The function processes these constraints to determine the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints for each test case. The function prints a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of valid integers `k` that meet the constraints for the corresponding test case. If no valid `k` exists for a test case, the function prints 0 for that test case. **
