### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries to compare the bitwise OR of two pairs of indices.
   - The final answer is printed in the format `! i j`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function sends a query to the interactor and returns the result.
     - It constructs the query string and prints it with `flush=True` to ensure the output is immediately sent.
     - It then reads the input from the interactor and returns it.
     - This function is correct and handles the interaction as required.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - **Step 1: Finding the Maximum Item Index:**
       - The function initializes `max_item_idx` to 0.
       - It iterates over the range from 1 to \(n-1\) and compares the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` with itself to the bitwise OR of the current index \(i\) with itself.
       - If the result is '<', it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\).
       - This step ensures that `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value in the permutation \(p\). However, this is not necessarily true because the bitwise OR of a number with itself is the number itself, and the maximum value in the permutation is not necessarily the one that will maximize the XOR with another value.

     - **Step 2: Finding the Pair Index:**
       - The function initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
       - It iterates over the range from 0 to \(n-1\) and compares the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` to the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` and the current index \(i\).
       - If the result is '<', it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
       - If the result is '=', it further compares the bitwise OR of `pair_idx` with itself to the bitwise OR of \(i\) with itself.
       - If the result of this comparison is '>', it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
       - This step aims to find the index that, when XORed with `max_item_idx`, gives a high value. However, the logic here is flawed. The bitwise OR comparison does not directly help in maximizing the XOR value. The XOR operation is more complex and depends on the bit patterns of the numbers, not just their magnitude.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Finding the Maximum Item Index:**
     - The first loop does not necessarily find the index of the maximum value in the permutation \(p\). Instead, it finds the index of the value that, when ORed with itself, is the largest. This is not the same as finding the index of the maximum value in the permutation.
     - For example, if \(p = [3, 1, 2, 0]\), the first loop will set `max_item_idx` to 0 because \(3 \mid 3 = 3\) and \(1 \mid 1 = 1\), \(2 \mid 2 = 2\), \(0 \mid 0 = 0\). However, the maximum value in the permutation is 3, and the index should be 0.

   - **Finding the Pair Index:**
     - The second loop is intended to find the index that maximizes the XOR with `max_item_idx`. However, the bitwise OR comparisons do not directly help in this task.
     - The logic of comparing the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` to the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` and \(i\) is not sufficient to determine the maximum XOR. The XOR operation is more complex and requires a different approach to find the maximum value.
     - For example, if \(p = [3, 1, 2, 0]\) and `max_item_idx` is 0, the second loop will not necessarily find the correct `pair_idx` that maximizes \(p_0 \oplus p_j\).

   - **Query Count:**
     - The first loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
     - The second loop makes \(n\) queries.
     - The total number of queries is \(2n-1\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly identify the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - The logic used to find `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` is flawed and does not guarantee the correct result.
   - The number of queries used is within the allowed limit, but the correctness of the solution is not ensured.
