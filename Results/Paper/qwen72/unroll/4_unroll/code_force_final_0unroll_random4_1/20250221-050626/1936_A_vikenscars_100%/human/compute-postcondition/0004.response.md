To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range(n)` function and will start at 0.
2. **Variable `n`**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

The state of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, they are part of the initial state, and we should describe them as they are.

Given the initial state:
- `max_item_idx` is the index of the last element in the range from 1 to n-1 for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<'. If no such element exists, `max_item_idx` remains 0.
- `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`.

The adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`max_item_idx` is the index of the last element in the range from 1 to n-1 for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<'. If no such element exists, `max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
