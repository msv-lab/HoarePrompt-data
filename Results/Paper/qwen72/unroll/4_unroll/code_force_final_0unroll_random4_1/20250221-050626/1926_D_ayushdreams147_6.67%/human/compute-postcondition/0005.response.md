The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_j\) satisfies 0 ≤ \(a_j\) < 2^31. The function returns the number of unique integers in `a` that, when XORed with \(2^{31} - 1\), do not already exist in `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the count of unique integers in `a` that, when XORed with \(2^{31} - 1\), do not already exist in `a`.**
