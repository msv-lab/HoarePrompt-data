The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` does not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used, so it does not need to be initialized to any specific value.

State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `t` must be greater than 0**
