Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players in a series of chess games. The key points to consider are:

1. **Total Score Parity**: The sum of all scores must be even because each game (whether it ends in a win/loss or a draw) contributes an even number of points (2 for a win/loss, 2 for a draw).
2. **Score Distribution**: If the highest score \( p_3 \) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores \( p_1 + p_2 \), it implies that the highest score could have been achieved by winning all the games against the other two players, and the remaining games could have been draws.
3. **Adjusting Scores**: If \( p_3 \) is less than \( p_1 + p_2 \), the program attempts to adjust the scores to find the maximum number of draws. It does this by iteratively reducing the scores of the players to find a valid distribution of draws.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- **Total Score Parity Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1, which is correct because an odd total score is impossible.
- **Score Distribution Check**: If \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), the program prints \( p_1 + p_2 \). This is correct because the maximum number of draws is the sum of the two lower scores, as the highest score could have been achieved by winning all the games against the other two players.
- **Adjusting Scores Loop**: The loop attempts to find a valid distribution of draws by adjusting the scores. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. The loop should be designed to find the maximum number of draws such that the scores remain consistent. The current logic does not correctly handle this.

To correct the logic, we need to ensure that the loop correctly finds the maximum number of draws. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            # Calculate the maximum number of draws
            draws = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2 - (p3 - p1 - p2)
            if draws >= 0:
                print(draws)
            else:
                print(-1)
```

In the corrected version:
- We calculate the total number of points and then find the maximum number of draws by ensuring the remaining points are distributed correctly.
- The formula \((p1 + p2 + p3) // 2 - (p3 - p1 - p2)\) ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly.

Given the original program, the logic inside the loop is not correct, and it does not handle all cases properly. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
