Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly calculate the maximum number of draws in some scenarios. One such case is when the scores are (1, 1, 2). According to the problem description, the maximum number of draws that could have happened is 2, but the program outputs 3, which is incorrect.

Let's break down the logic for the input (1, 1, 2):

1. The total score is \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\), which is even, so the program does not immediately return -1.
2. The program then checks if \(p3 \geq p1 + p2\). In this case, \(2 < 1 + 1\), so it enters the else block.
3. Inside the else block, the program initializes \(x = 0\) and \(y = p3 = 2\).
4. The while loop runs as long as \(y \geq x\):
   - First iteration: \(x = 0\), \(y = 2\). The condition \(p1 - x \leq p2 - y\) is \(1 - 0 \leq 1 - 2\), which is false, so it increments \(x\) and decrements \(y\).
   - Second iteration: \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\). The condition \(p1 - x \leq p2 - y\) is \(1 - 1 \leq 1 - 1\), which is true, so it prints \(p1 - x + p3 = 1 - 1 + 2 = 2\).

However, the correct output for (1, 1, 2) should be 2, not 3. The program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of draws in this case.
