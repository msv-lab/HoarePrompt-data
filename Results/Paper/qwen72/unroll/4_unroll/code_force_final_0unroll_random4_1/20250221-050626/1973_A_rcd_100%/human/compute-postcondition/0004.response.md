Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` as input, representing the scores of three players. The function then processes these scores and prints a result for each test case. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. If `p_3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p_1` and `p_2`, it prints the sum of `p_1` and `p_2`. Otherwise, it prints the maximum possible score that can be achieved by adjusting the scores of the players, which is either `p_1 - x + p_3` or `p_3`, depending on the conditions inside the loop. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. **
