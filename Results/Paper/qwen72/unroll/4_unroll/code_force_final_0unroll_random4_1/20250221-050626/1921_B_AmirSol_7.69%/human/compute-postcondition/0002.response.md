The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is a positive integer, it is already greater than 0, and `i` is 0, which means `i < n` is true. Therefore, the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0**
