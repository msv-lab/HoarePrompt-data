Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples. Here's a breakdown of why it should work:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the dimensions of the grid for each test case. It then reads the grid itself.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the first row and the last row are not the same but the first row is entirely one color, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color if the first and last rows are different.
   - If the first column and the last column are not the same but the first column is entirely one color, it prints "NO" for the same reason.

3. **General Case**:
   - If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints "YES". This is because if the first and last rows or the first and last columns are not entirely one color or are the same, it is possible to perform operations to make the entire grid the same color.

The logic in the program ensures that it correctly identifies when it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color and when it is possible. The examples provided in the problem statement are handled correctly by the program. Therefore, the program is correct.
