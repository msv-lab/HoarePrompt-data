### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if it is possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the specified operations. The operations allow selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them that color.

The program's logic is based on the following observations:
1. **First and Last Rows**: If the first row of the grid is entirely one color and different from the last row, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the first row and the last row would remain different, and no operation can change this.
2. **First and Last Columns**: Similarly, if the first column of the grid is entirely one color and different from the last column, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the first column and the last column would remain different, and no operation can change this.

The program checks these conditions:
- It constructs the `first_row` by concatenating the first character of each row.
- It constructs the `last_row` by concatenating the last character of each row.
- It then checks if the first row is entirely one color and different from the last row.
- It also checks if the first column is entirely one color and different from the last column.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program:
- The program only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns. It does not consider the entire grid.
- For example, if the first row and last row are the same but the first column and last column are different, the program will incorrectly print "YES".

### Correctness:
**False**

### Example of a Failing Test Case:
Consider the following grid:
```
3 3
W B W
B W B
W B W
```
- The first row is "W B W" and the last row is "W B W", which are the same.
- The first column is "W B W" and the last column is "W B W", which are the same.
- However, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the given operations.

The program will incorrectly print "YES" for this case, while the correct answer should be "NO".

### Corrected Program:
To correctly determine if it is possible to make the entire grid the same color, we need to check if there is at least one row or one column that is entirely one color. If such a row or column exists, it is possible to make the entire grid that color by selecting the entire row or column as the subrectangle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
        
        # Check if any row is entirely one color
        for row in a:
            if len(set(row)) == 1:
                print('YES')
                break
        else:
            # Check if any column is entirely one color
            for col in range(m):
                if len(set(a[row][col] for row in range(n))) == 1:
                    print('YES')
                    break
            else:
                print('NO')
```

This corrected program will correctly handle all test cases, including the one provided above.
