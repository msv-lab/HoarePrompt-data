The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines each containing `m` characters 'W' or 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The sum of `n * m` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from stdin, each describing a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters, and returns the result for each test case.**
