You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid, followed by n lines each containing m characters 'W' or 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop will have processed all test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed 'NO' if the first row of the grid is entirely one color ('W' or 'B') and different from the last row, or if the first column of the grid is entirely one color and different from the last column. Otherwise, it will have printed 'YES'. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` will be reset for each test case, and their values will not persist between test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Grid Construction:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid row by row and stores it in a list `a`.

2. **First and Last Row Analysis:**
   - The program constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
   - `first_row` contains the first character of each row.
   - `last_row` contains the last character of each row.

3. **Conditions for Impossibility:**
   - The program checks two conditions to determine if it is impossible to make all squares the same color:
     - **Condition 1:** If the first row is entirely one color (i.e., `len(set(a[0])) == 1`) and the first row is different from the last row (`a[0] != a[-1]`), it prints "NO".
     - **Condition 2:** If the first column (represented by `first_row`) is entirely one color (i.e., `len(set(first_row)) == 1`) and the first column is different from the last column (`first_row != last_row`), it prints "NO".

4. **Conditions for Possibility:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES".

### Analysis of Conditions:

- **Condition 1:**
  - If the first row is entirely one color and different from the last row, it means that the first row is already uniform but the last row is not. This makes it impossible to change the last row to match the first row using the given operations, as the operations can only change a subrectangle to a single color if the selected squares are the same color.
  - This condition correctly identifies a scenario where the grid cannot be made uniform.

- **Condition 2:**
  - If the first column is entirely one color and different from the last column, it means that the first column is already uniform but the last column is not. This makes it impossible to change the last column to match the first column using the given operations, for the same reason as Condition 1.
  - This condition also correctly identifies a scenario where the grid cannot be made uniform.

- **General Case:**
  - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program assumes that it is possible to make the grid uniform. This is a valid assumption because:
    - If the first row and the last row are not entirely one color, or if the first column and the last column are not entirely one color, there is always a way to select two squares of the same color and perform operations to eventually make the entire grid uniform.
    - The operations can be used to propagate the color from the edges towards the center of the grid, ensuring that all squares can be made the same color.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the scenarios where it is impossible to make the grid uniform and prints "NO" in those cases. It also correctly prints "YES" in all other cases, which are valid for making the grid uniform. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
