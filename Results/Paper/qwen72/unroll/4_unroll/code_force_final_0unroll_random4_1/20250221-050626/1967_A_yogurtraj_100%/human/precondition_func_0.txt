The function `func` is not provided with any parameters, but based on the problem description, it is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
