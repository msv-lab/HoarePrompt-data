The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from stdin, where the input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12). The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from stdin, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and an integer `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns the result for each test case.**
