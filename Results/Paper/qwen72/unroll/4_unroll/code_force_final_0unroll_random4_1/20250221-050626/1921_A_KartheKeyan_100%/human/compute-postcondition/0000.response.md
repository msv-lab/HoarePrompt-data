Initial State: The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and it is guaranteed that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.

Code Snippet:
```
n = int(input())
     
while n :
    
    l = int(input())
    s = 0
    s += (l//4)+(l-(4*(l//4)))//2
    print(s)
    n-=1
```

Step-by-Step Impact:
1. `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
2. The while loop runs as long as `n` is not zero.
3. Inside the loop:
   - `l` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `s` is updated to `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`.
   - The value of `s` is printed.
   - `n` is decremented by 1.
4. The loop continues until `n` is 0.

Output State:
**`n` is 0, `l` is the last input integer, `s` is the last calculated value of `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`, and the last value of `s` has been printed. The function should still accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and it is guaranteed that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.**
