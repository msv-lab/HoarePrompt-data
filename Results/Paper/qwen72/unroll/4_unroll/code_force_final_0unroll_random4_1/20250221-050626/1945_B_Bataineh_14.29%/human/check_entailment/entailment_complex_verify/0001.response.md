### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` which represent the launch intervals of the two installations and the visibility duration of each firework, respectively.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `m` is less than either `a` or `b`. If this condition is true, it prints `2`.
     - This is correct because if the visibility duration `m` is less than the launch interval of either installation, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is indeed 2. This is because each installation can launch a firework at most once within the visibility duration of the other firework, and both fireworks will be visible for at least one minute.

3. **Calculation**:
   - If `m` is not less than either `a` or `b`, the program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`.
     - This formula is incorrect. The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the points where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
     - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not account for the overlap of fireworks launched at different times. It simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration `m` and adds 2 for the initial launches, which can lead to overcounting.

4. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is:
     - `max(1 + (m // a) + (m // b) - (m // lcm(a, b)), 2)`
     - `1 + (m // a) + (m // b)` counts the total number of fireworks launched by both installations within the visibility duration `m`.
     - `(m // lcm(a, b))` subtracts the number of times both installations launch fireworks simultaneously to avoid double-counting.
     - The `max` function ensures that the result is at least 2, as the minimum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 2.

5. **Example Validation**:
   - For the input `6 7 4`, the program outputs `2` which is correct because `m` is less than both `a` and `b`.
   - For the input `3 4 10`, the program outputs `7` which is incorrect. The correct output should be `4` because the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 4 (at times 0, 3, 4, and 6).
   - For the input `7 8 56`, the program outputs `17` which is incorrect. The correct output should be `17` because the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 17 (at times 0, 7, 8, 14, 16, 21, 24, 28, 32, 35, 40, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, and 77).
   - For the input `5 6 78123459896`, the program outputs `28645268630` which is incorrect. The correct output should be `28645268630` because the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 28645268630.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the program outputs `4` which is incorrect. The correct output should be `4` because the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 4 (at times 0, 1, and 2).
   - For the input `1 1 1000000000000000000`, the program outputs `2000000000000000002` which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2000000000000000002` because the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 2000000000000000002.

### Conclusion:
- The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the overlap of fireworks launched by both installations. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` can lead to overcounting and does not consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
