### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Conditions:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Special Cases:**
   - If `k > n`, it means you cannot perform any operations because you don't have enough cards to form a group of `k` cards. Therefore, the minimum number of cards you can have is `n` itself.
   - If `k == n`, it means you can perform one operation to exchange all `n` cards for `k-1` cards. Therefore, the minimum number of cards you can have is `k-1`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in the list `nums`, but caps the frequency at `k`. This is done to ensure that if a card number appears more than `k` times, it is treated as if it appeared exactly `k` times, which is the maximum number of cards that can be exchanged at once.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - After calculating the frequency, the program checks if any card number appears exactly `k` times.
   - If any card number appears exactly `k` times, it means you can perform an operation to exchange all `k` cards for `k-1` cards, reducing the total number of cards by 1. Therefore, the minimum number of cards you can have is `k-1`.
   - If no card number appears exactly `k` times, the program prints `n`, which is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of reducing the number of cards through operations.

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly handle the general case where the number of cards can be reduced through multiple operations.
- The logic to determine the minimum number of cards left is flawed. It should consider the total number of cards that can be exchanged and the remaining cards after all possible operations.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach would involve:
  - Calculating the frequency of each card number.
  - Determining the number of complete groups of `k` cards that can be formed.
  - Calculating the remaining cards after all possible operations.
  - The minimum number of cards left would be the remainder of `n` divided by `k` plus the number of groups of `k` cards that cannot be fully exchanged.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case where the number of cards can be reduced through multiple operations. The logic to determine the minimum number of cards left is flawed.

### Correctness:
**False**
