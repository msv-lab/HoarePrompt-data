Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution for this problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function Signature and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to take two inputs \(n\) and \(m\), but it only reads two integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The variable `k` is not used in the function, and the variable `m` is missing.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The logic inside `func_1` is incorrect. It calculates `ans` by adding `n` to the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each integer `i` from 2 to the square root of `n`. This does not correspond to the problem's requirement of counting pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints `ans`, which is not the correct output for the problem. The correct output should be the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
