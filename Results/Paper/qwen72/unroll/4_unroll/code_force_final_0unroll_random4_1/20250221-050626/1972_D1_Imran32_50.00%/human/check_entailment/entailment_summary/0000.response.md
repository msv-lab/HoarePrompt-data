Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is incorrect for the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the program does not implement this logic at all. Instead, it calculates a different value `ans` using a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`. This calculation is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

The function `func_1` also does not use the variable `k` (which should be `m` based on the problem statement), and the logic inside the loop does not match the conditions specified in the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
