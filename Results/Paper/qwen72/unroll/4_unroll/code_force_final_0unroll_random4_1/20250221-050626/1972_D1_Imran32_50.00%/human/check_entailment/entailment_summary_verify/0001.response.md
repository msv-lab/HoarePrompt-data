### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - The function `func_1()` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\) based on the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive) and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to it.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The function `func_1()` is not correctly solving the problem as described.
   - The variable `k` is read but not used in the function, which suggests a mismatch in the function's parameters.
   - The logic inside the function does not match the problem's requirement to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function `func_1()` is performing a completely different calculation that is not related to the problem's conditions.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \((a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - This requires a more complex algorithm, possibly involving iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition.
   - The correct approach would involve a nested loop to iterate over all \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) and all \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), and for each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\) and check the condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1()` is not implementing the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the logical flaws and the mismatch in the function's parameters.

Final: **False**
