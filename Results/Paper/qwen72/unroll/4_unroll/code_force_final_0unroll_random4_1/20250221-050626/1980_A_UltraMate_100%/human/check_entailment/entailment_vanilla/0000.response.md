Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Existing Problems**: The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`. This is a valid and efficient way to count the frequencies of each character.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the string `p = 'ABCDEFG'`, which represents the required difficulty levels for each round.
   - For each difficulty level `i` in `p`, it checks if `i` is not in the `Counter` `hmp`. If `i` is not present, it means there are no problems of that difficulty level, so `ans` is incremented by `m` (since `m` rounds are needed and each round requires one problem of each difficulty level).
   - If `i` is present in `hmp` but the count is less than `m`, it means there are not enough problems of that difficulty level. The program correctly calculates the additional problems needed by adding `m - hmp[i]` to `ans`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case, which is the correct output format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where there are no problems of a certain difficulty level by adding `m` to `ans`.
   - It also handles the case where there are some problems but not enough by adding the difference `m - hmp[i]` to `ans`.

Given the problem description and the constraints, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by calculating the minimum number of additional problems needed to hold `m` rounds.

Correctness: **True**
