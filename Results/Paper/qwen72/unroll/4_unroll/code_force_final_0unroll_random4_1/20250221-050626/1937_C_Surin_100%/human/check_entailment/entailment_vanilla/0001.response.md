### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries of the form \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) vs \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes \( v1 \) to 0 and iterates over the range \( 1 \) to \( n-1 \) to find the index \( v1 \) such that \( p_{v1} \) is the maximum value in the permutation. This is done by comparing \( p_{v1} \mid p_{v1} \) with \( p_i \mid p_i \) for each \( i \) in the range.
   - Once \( v1 \) is found, the program then iterates over the range \( 1 \) to \( n-1 \) again to find the index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized. This is done by comparing \( p_{v1} \mid p_i \) with \( p_{v1} \mid p_{prev} \) and adjusting \( prev \) accordingly.
   - Finally, the program outputs the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \) as the answer.

3. **Query Analysis:**
   - The first loop (to find \( v1 \)) uses \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The second loop (to find \( prev \)) uses \( n-1 \) queries in the worst case.
   - The total number of queries is \( 2n-2 \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The first loop correctly identifies the index \( v1 \) such that \( p_{v1} \) is the maximum value in the permutation. This is because \( p_i \mid p_i = p_i \), and the loop ensures that \( v1 \) is the index of the maximum value.
   - The second loop correctly identifies the index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized. This is because the loop ensures that \( prev \) is the index of the value that, when XORed with \( p_{v1} \), gives the maximum result.
   - The program handles the input and output correctly, including flushing the output after each query and answer.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program works for the smallest valid \( n \) (i.e., \( n = 2 \)).
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( p \) is a permutation of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem. It uses a valid number of queries and correctly identifies the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.

### Correctness:
**True**
