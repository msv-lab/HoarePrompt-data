The only objects in the loop head are the variable `kp` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `kp` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`kp` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
