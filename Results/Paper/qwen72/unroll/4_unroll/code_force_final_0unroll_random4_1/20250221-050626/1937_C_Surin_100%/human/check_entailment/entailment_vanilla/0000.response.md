### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \(3n\) queries, where each query compares the bitwise OR of two pairs of indices.

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding the maximum value in the permutation \(p\). This is done by comparing each element \(p_i\) with \(p_0\) using the query \(? 0 0 i i\).
   - If the result is '<', it means \(p_i\) is greater than \(p_0\), and \(v1\) is updated to \(i\).

3. **Finding the Second Maximum:**
   - After finding the maximum value \(p_{v1}\), the program tries to find the second maximum value that, when XORed with \(p_{v1}\), gives the maximum result.
   - It does this by comparing \(p_{v1} \mid p_i\) with \(p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}\) using the query \(? v1 i v1 prev\).
   - If the result is '>', it means \(p_i\) is a better candidate for the second maximum, and \(prev\) is updated to \(i\).
   - If the result is '=', it means \(p_i\) and \(p_{prev}\) are equal, and a further query \(? i i prev prev\) is made to break the tie.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - After the second loop, \(prev\) and \(v1\) are the indices that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\).
   - The program outputs the result using the format \(! prev v1\).

5. **Query Count Analysis:**
   - The first loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
   - The second loop makes \(n-1\) queries in the worst case.
   - Therefore, the total number of queries is \(2n-2\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \(n = 2\) correctly, as it will find the two indices and output the result without exceeding the query limit.
   - The program also handles the case where the permutation is a simple sequence like \([0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1]\) or a reversed sequence.

7. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum value in the permutation.
   - The second loop correctly identifies the second value that maximizes the XOR with the maximum value.
   - The program ensures that the number of queries does not exceed \(3n\).

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
