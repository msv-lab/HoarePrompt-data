The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes a list of integers representing vertices chosen by Bessie and calculates a value `ans` based on the following criteria: 
1. It initializes `ans` to `x - 2`.
2. It increments `ans` for each element in the list where the next element modulo `n` is not present in the list, but the element after that is.
3. It then calculates the gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted list (considering the list as circular) and sorts these gaps.
4. For each gap, if `y` is greater than or equal to half the gap, it adds the gap to `ans` and decreases `y` by half the gap. If `y` is less than half the gap, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and breaks the loop.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, `a` is a sorted list of the original elements minus 1, `present` is a set containing all unique elements of `a`, and `gaps` is a list of the positive differences between consecutive elements in `a`.
