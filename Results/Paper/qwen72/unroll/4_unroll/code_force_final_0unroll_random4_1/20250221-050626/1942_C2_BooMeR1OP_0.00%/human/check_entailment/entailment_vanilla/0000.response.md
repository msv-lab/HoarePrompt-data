### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of vertices `a` that Bessie has chosen and adjusts them to be 0-indexed by subtracting 1 from each vertex.

2. **Initial Triangular Pieces Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices can form at least `x - 2` triangles by connecting them in a non-intersecting manner.

3. **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
   - The program iterates through the chosen vertices `a` and checks if adding a vertex at `(a[i] + 1) % n` or `(a[i] + 2) % n` can form additional triangles.
   - If `t1` (i.e., `(a[i] + 1) % n`) is not already present in the set of chosen vertices and `t2` (i.e., `(a[i] + 2) % n`) is present, it increments `ans` by 1. This is because adding `t1` can form a new triangle with `a[i]` and `t2`.

4. **Calculating Gaps:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices in the sorted list `a`.
   - It uses a list `gaps` to store these gaps. The gaps are calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, where `next_elem` is the next vertex in the sorted list, wrapping around the polygon if necessary.

5. **Maximizing Triangles by Adding Vertices:**
   - The program sorts the gaps in ascending order.
   - It then iterates through the gaps and tries to add vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
   - For each gap, it calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added (`pairs = gap // 2`).
   - If `y` (the number of vertices you can add) is greater than or equal to `pairs`, it adds `gap` to `ans` and decreases `y` by `pairs`.
   - If `y` is less than `pairs`, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and breaks out of the loop, as no more vertices can be added.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Initial Triangular Pieces Calculation:**
  - The initial calculation of `ans` as `x - 2` is correct because any set of `x` vertices can form at least `x - 2` triangles by connecting them in a non-intersecting manner.

- **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
  - The logic to check if adding a vertex at `(a[i] + 1) % n` or `(a[i] + 2) % n` can form additional triangles is correct. This ensures that the new vertex forms a valid triangle with the existing vertices.

- **Calculating Gaps:**
  - The calculation of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices is correct. The gaps are calculated correctly and stored in a list.

- **Maximizing Triangles by Adding Vertices:**
  - The logic to maximize the number of triangles by adding vertices is correct. The program sorts the gaps and iterates through them, adding vertices as needed and updating `ans` and `y` accordingly.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the logic for maximizing the number of triangular pieces is sound.

Correctness: **True**
