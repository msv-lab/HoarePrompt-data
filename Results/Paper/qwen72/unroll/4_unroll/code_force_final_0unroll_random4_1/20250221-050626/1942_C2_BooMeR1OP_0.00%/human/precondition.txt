t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 <= y <= n - x, representing the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, respectively. The second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
