Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for placing the icons. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons as `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y % 2 == 1`. However, this is not always correct. For example, if `y = 3`, the program will calculate `screen_require_for_y = 2`, but in reality, 3 2x2 icons can fit into 2 screens, not 3.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Cells:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons as `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This is incorrect because it assumes that each screen has 15 cells, but a screen has 15 cells only if it is completely empty. When 2x2 icons are placed, the number of remaining cells is not simply `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Extra Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the extra screens required for 1x1 icons as `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the actual remaining space on the screens already used for 2x2 icons.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

- Each screen has 15 cells.
- 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells each.
- 1x1 icons occupy 1 cell each.
- We should first place as many 2x2 icons as possible on the screens, then place the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_cells = 15
        screens = 0
        
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_y = (y * 4 + total_cells - 1) // total_cells
        remaining_cells = screens_for_y * total_cells - y * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 1x1 icons
        if x <= remaining_cells:
            screens = screens_for_y
        else:
            extra_cells_needed = x - remaining_cells
            extra_screens = (extra_cells_needed + total_cells - 1) // total_cells
            screens = screens_for_y + extra_screens
        
        result.append(screens)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is calculated correctly, and then it checks if the remaining cells on those screens can accommodate the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
