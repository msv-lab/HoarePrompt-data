Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y` (where 0 <= x, y <= 99). For each test case, it calculates the number of screens required based on the space occupied by `x` and `y` and the available space on the screens. The function then prints the number of screens required for each test case, one per line. The final state of the program is that the `result` list contains the number of screens required for each test case, and these values are printed to the console. **
