### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Space Requirements:**
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`) and the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - It then calculates the total space required by summing `space_x` and `space_y`.

3. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program determines the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the program calculates:
     - If `y` is even, the number of screens required is `y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required is `y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Checking if 1x1 Icons Fit:**
   - If the total space required for 1x1 icons (`space_x`) is less than or equal to the remaining cells, the program appends the number of screens required for 2x2 icons to the result.
   - If the 1x1 icons do not fit, the program calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`
     - If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, the number of additional screens required is `space_x // 15`.
     - Otherwise, the number of additional screens required is `extra_space // 15 + 1`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total number of screens required to the result list and prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the allocation of 2x2 icons and calculates the number of screens required for them.
- It also correctly calculates the remaining cells on these screens and checks if the 1x1 icons can fit within these remaining cells.
- If the 1x1 icons do not fit, it calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons and adds this to the total number of screens.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case where `x` and `y` are both zero, correctly outputting 0 screens.
- It also handles cases where only 1x1 icons are present, correctly calculating the number of screens needed.
- It handles cases where only 2x2 icons are present, correctly calculating the number of screens needed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It follows the logic of allocating screens for 2x2 icons first and then fitting the 1x1 icons into the remaining space, calculating additional screens if necessary.

### Correctness:
**True**
