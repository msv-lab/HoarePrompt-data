### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each case.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x`) and the 2x2 icons (`space_y`).
   - The total space required is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program determines the number of screens required to fit all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the program calculates the number of screens required for `y` icons.
   - If `y` is even, it divides `y` by 2 to get the number of screens needed.
   - If `y` is odd, it divides `y` by 2 and adds 1 to account for the extra screen needed for the last 2x2 icon.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - After determining the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining cells available on these screens.
   - It then checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to fit all the 1x1 icons (`space_x`).

5. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional screens required to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The extra space required is calculated as `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
   - The number of additional screens required is calculated as `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program appends the total number of screens required (either just the screens for 2x2 icons or the sum of screens for 2x2 icons and additional screens for 1x1 icons) to the `result` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation for 2x2 Icons**: The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and a 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells. Therefore, the number of 2x2 icons that can fit on one screen is `15 // 4 = 3` (not 2). The program should calculate the number of screens required for `y` icons as `screen_require_for_y = (y + 2) // 3`.

- **Incorrect Remaining Cells Calculation**: The program calculates the remaining cells as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

- **Incorrect Extra Screen Calculation**: The program calculates the extra screens required for 1x1 icons as `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`. This is correct, but the initial calculation of `screen_require_for_y` is incorrect.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        screen_require_for_y = (y + 2) // 3  # Corrected calculation for 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            extra_screen = (extra_space + 14) // 15  # Corrected calculation for extra screens
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has an incorrect calculation for the number of screens required for 2x2 icons, which affects the overall correctness of the solution. The corrected program should be used to ensure the correct number of screens is calculated.
