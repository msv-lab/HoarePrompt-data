### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each case.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x`) and the 2x2 icons (`space_y`). This is done correctly by multiplying `x` by 1 and `y` by 4, respectively.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`). If `y` is even, it divides `y` by 2. If `y` is odd, it divides `y` by 2 and adds 1. This is correct because each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells, and a screen has 15 cells, so the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons is `y // 2` if `y` is even, and `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells`). This is done by multiplying the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons by 15 and then subtracting the total space occupied by the 2x2 icons. This is correct.

5. **Handling 1x1 Icons:**
   - The program checks if the remaining space on the screens is sufficient for all the 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`). If it is, it appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result list. If not, it calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons (`extra_screen`) and adds this to the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, one per line, which is the correct format as specified in the problem description.

### Potential Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation for Extra Screens:**
  - The calculation for `extra_screen` is incorrect. The program should calculate the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons based on the total number of 1x1 icons that need to be placed, not just the extra space. The correct calculation should be:
    ```python
    extra_screen = (space_x - remaining_cells + 14) // 15
    ```
  - This ensures that if the remaining space is not enough, the program correctly calculates the number of additional screens needed, including the case where the remaining space is just one cell short of a full screen.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_screen = (space_x - remaining_cells + 14) // 15
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Conclusion:
- The original program has a logical error in the calculation of the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
