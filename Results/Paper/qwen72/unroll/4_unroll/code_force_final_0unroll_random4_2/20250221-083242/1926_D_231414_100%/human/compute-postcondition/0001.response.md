Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a_1, ..., a_n are integers such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `times` is an input integer. `check` is 2147483647.**

The variable `check` is assigned the value `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is 2147483647. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
