The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `times`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The other variables and conditions mentioned in the state before the loop starts do not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`times` must be greater than 0**
