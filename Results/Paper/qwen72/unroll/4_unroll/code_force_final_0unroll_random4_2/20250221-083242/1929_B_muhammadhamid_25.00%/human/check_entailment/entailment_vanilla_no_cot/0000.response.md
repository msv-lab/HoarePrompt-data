Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description and the examples given. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
2. **Base Case Handling**: If `k == 1`, the program prints `1`, which is correct because coloring one cell will ensure at least one diagonal has a colored cell.
3. **General Case Handling**:
   - If `k <= 2 * n`, the program prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because in a grid of size `n x n`, the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered by coloring a single row or column is `2 * n - 1`. By coloring cells in a way that each cell covers two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal), the minimum number of cells required is `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - If `k > 2 * n`, the program prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is also correct because after covering `2 * n` diagonals with `n` cells, each additional cell will cover two more diagonals. Therefore, the remaining diagonals to be covered are `k - 2 * n`, and the number of additional cells required is `math.ceil((k - 2 * n) / 2)`, which simplifies to `(k - 2 * n) // 2 + 1`. Adding this to the `n` cells already used gives `k // 2 + 1`.

The program handles all the cases correctly and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
