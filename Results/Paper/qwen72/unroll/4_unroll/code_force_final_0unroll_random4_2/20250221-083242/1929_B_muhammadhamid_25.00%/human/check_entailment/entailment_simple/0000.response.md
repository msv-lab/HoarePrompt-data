### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the size of the square grid and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `k == 1`, the function prints `1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if only one diagonal needs to be colored, the minimum number of cells to color is 1.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - If `k <= 2 * n`, the function prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is because in a square grid of size `n x n`, there are `2 * n` main diagonals (both primary and secondary diagonals). To cover `k` diagonals, the minimum number of cells needed is `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one primary and one secondary diagonal).
   - If `k > 2 * n`, the function prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is because after covering the `2 * n` main diagonals, the remaining diagonals need to be covered. Each additional cell can cover 2 diagonals, but since `k` is greater than `2 * n`, the remaining `k - 2 * n` diagonals need to be covered by additional cells, and the formula `k // 2 + 1` ensures that the minimum number of cells is used.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the minimum number of cells needed to color to satisfy the condition for `k` diagonals.
