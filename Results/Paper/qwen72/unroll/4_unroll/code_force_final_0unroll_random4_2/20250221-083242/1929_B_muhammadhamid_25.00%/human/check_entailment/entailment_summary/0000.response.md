Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program uses the following logic:

1. **Base Case (k == 1):** If \( k \) is 1, it means only one diagonal needs to have a colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring just one cell, so the program prints 1.
2. **Case (k <= 2 * n):** If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2n \), it means the number of diagonals to be colored is within the range where a single cell can cover two diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal). The program prints the ceiling of \( k / 2 \), which is the minimum number of cells needed to cover \( k \) diagonals.
3. **Case (k > 2 * n):** If \( k \) is greater than \( 2n \), it means more than half of the diagonals need to be covered. In this case, the program prints \( k // 2 + 1 \). This is because each cell can cover at most two diagonals, and the remaining cells needed to cover the extra diagonals are calculated by \( k // 2 \) plus one additional cell to ensure all \( k \) diagonals are covered.

Let's verify the program with the given test cases:

- **Test Case 1 (n = 3, k = 4):** 
  - \( k \leq 2n \) (4 <= 6)
  - \( \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \)
  - Correct output: 2

- **Test Case 2 (n = 3, k = 3):**
  - \( k \leq 2n \) (3 <= 6)
  - \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \)
  - Correct output: 2

- **Test Case 3 (n = 3, k = 10):**
  - \( k > 2n \) (10 > 6)
  - \( 10 // 2 + 1 = 6 \)
  - Correct output: 6

- **Test Case 4 (n = 3, k = 9):**
  - \( k > 2n \) (9 > 6)
  - \( 9 // 2 + 1 = 5 \)
  - Correct output: 5

- **Test Case 5 (n = 4, k = 7):**
  - \( k \leq 2n \) (7 <= 8)
  - \( \lceil 7 / 2 \rceil = 4 \)
  - Correct output: 4

- **Test Case 6 (n = 7, k = 11):**
  - \( k \leq 2n \) (11 <= 14)
  - \( \lceil 11 / 2 \rceil = 6 \)
  - Correct output: 6

- **Test Case 7 (n = 2, k = 3):**
  - \( k \leq 2n \) (3 <= 4)
  - \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \)
  - Correct output: 2

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
