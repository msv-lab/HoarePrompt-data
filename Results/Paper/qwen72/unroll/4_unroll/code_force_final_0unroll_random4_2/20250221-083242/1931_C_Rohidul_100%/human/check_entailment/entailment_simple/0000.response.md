### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the array `a` is already uniform (all elements are the same), the cost should be 0. This is correctly handled by the condition `if a[0] == a[-1]: ans = max(0, le - (st + end))`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The function uses two pointers `l` and `r` to find the longest segments of consecutive equal elements at the beginning and the end of the array.
   - It increments `st` and `end` to count the lengths of these segments.
   - The cost to make the array uniform is calculated as `le - max(st, end)`, which is the length of the array minus the length of the longest segment of equal elements.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, it adjusts the cost to `max(0, le - (st + end))`, which is the length of the array minus the combined length of the segments at the beginning and the end.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Analysis of the Provided Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 6`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`
  - The longest segment at the beginning is `[1]` (length 1).
  - The longest segment at the end is `[1]` (length 1).
  - The cost is `6 - max(1, 1) = 4`.
  - Output: `4` (Correct).

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 7`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - The array is already uniform.
  - The cost is `0`.
  - Output: `0` (Correct).

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 8`, `a = [8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`
  - The longest segment at the beginning is `[8, 8, 8]` (length 3).
  - The longest segment at the end is `[8, 8, 8]` (length 3).
  - The cost is `8 - max(3, 3) = 5`.
  - However, the correct cost should be `2` (by setting the middle segment `[1, 2]` to `8`).
  - Output: `2` (Correct).

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 1`, `a = [1]`
  - The array is already uniform.
  - The cost is `0`.
  - Output: `0` (Correct).

- **Test Case 5**: `n = 2`, `a = [1, 2]`
  - The longest segment at the beginning is `[1]` (length 1).
  - The longest segment at the end is `[2]` (length 1).
  - The cost is `2 - max(1, 1) = 1`.
  - Output: `1` (Correct).

- **Test Case 6**: `n = 3`, `a = [1, 2, 3]`
  - The longest segment at the beginning is `[1]` (length 1).
  - The longest segment at the end is `[3]` (length 1).
  - The cost is `3 - max(1, 1) = 2`.
  - Output: `2` (Correct).

- **Test Case 7**: `n = 7`, `a = [4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`
  - The longest segment at the beginning is `[4]` (length 1).
  - The longest segment at the end is `[3]` (length 1).
  - The cost is `7 - max(1, 1) = 6`.
  - Output: `6` (Correct).

- **Test Case 8**: `n = 9`, `a = [9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3]`
  - The longest segment at the beginning is `[9, 9]` (length 2).
  - The longest segment at the end is `[3]` (length 1).
  - The cost is `9 - max(2, 1) = 7`.
  - Output: `7` (Correct).

The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and follows the problem description. The logic for finding the minimum cost to make the array uniform is sound and produces the correct results.
