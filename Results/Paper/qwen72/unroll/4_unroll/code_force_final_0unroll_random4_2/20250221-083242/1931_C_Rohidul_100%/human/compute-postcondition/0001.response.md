Output State: **The loop processes all test cases, and for each test case, it prints the value of `ans`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not retained between test cases, and the loop continues to the next test case after processing the current one. The final state of the loop is that all test cases have been processed and their respective `ans` values have been printed.**
