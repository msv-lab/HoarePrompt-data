Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans`, which represents the difference between the length of the list `a` and the maximum length of consecutive equal elements from either the start or the end of the list. If the first and last elements of the list are equal, it adjusts `ans` to account for this by subtracting the sum of the lengths of consecutive equal elements from both the start and the end. The function does not return any values; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and no state is retained between test cases. **
