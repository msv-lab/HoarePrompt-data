Precondition: **The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a binary string (a string consisting of characters '0' and '1') with a length of 1 to 500.** 

However, since the function definition provided does not include any parameters, it seems there might be a mistake. The correct function definition should be:

```
def func(s):
```

With the precondition as stated above.
