The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `t` binary strings `s` (where `s` is a string of '0's and '1's with a length between 1 and 500), the function calculates the number of adjacent character changes in `s`. If there is no increasing sequence (i.e., no '0' followed by '1') in `s`, it prints the count of adjacent changes plus one; otherwise, it prints the count of adjacent changes. After processing all `t` strings, the function completes and the value of `t` is 0, while `s` will be the last input binary string. The function does not return any value.
