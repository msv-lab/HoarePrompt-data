Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a binary string (a string consisting of characters '0' and '1') with a length of 1 to 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: The value of `t` is decreased by the number of iterations the loop has executed, and `s` will be the last input binary string provided during the loop's execution. The variables `count` and `flag` will be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration and will be used to calculate the number of adjacent character changes and the presence of an increasing sequence, respectively, for each input string `s`. After the loop finishes, `t` will be 0, and `s` will be the last input binary string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `t` binary strings `s` (where `s` is a string of '0's and '1's with a length between 1 and 500), the function calculates the number of adjacent character changes in `s`. If there is no increasing sequence (i.e., no '0' followed by '1') in `s`, it prints the count of adjacent changes plus one; otherwise, it prints the count of adjacent changes. After processing all `t` strings, the function completes and the value of `t` is 0, while `s` will be the last input binary string. The function does not return any value.
