The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of sale days `n`, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the total number of tickets to be bought `k`, and a list `a` of ticket prices for each day. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost required to buy exactly `k` tickets over the `n` sale days. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variable `t` will be 0, and the list `a` will be sorted and potentially modified. The final state of other variables (`L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost`) will be based on the last test case processed.
