### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It reads the list of ticket prices `M` from the second line.

2. **Constraints Handling:**
   - The program sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed. This is correct.

3. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` in ascending order. This is a good approach because buying tickets on the cheapest days first will minimize the total cost.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`. This is the number of days required to buy all `k` tickets, given that at most `m` tickets can be bought per day. This is correct.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` and stores them in `N`.

6. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is exactly `k` (i.e., `n * m == k`), the program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - `m * sum(N)` is the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days. This formula calculates the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers multiplied by `m * m`. This is correct.

   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is not exactly `k`, the program:
     - Pops the last element `w` from `N` and calculates `mu` as the remaining tickets to be bought (`k - (n - 1) * m`).
     - Calculates the cost of buying `mu` tickets on the last day as `mu * w`.
     - Calculates the cost of buying `m` tickets on the remaining `n-1` days as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)`.
     - Adds the additional cost due to the price increase on the last day as `n * m * mu`.

   - However, there is a logical error in the cost calculation for the case where `n * m != k`:
     - The additional cost due to the price increase on the last day should be `mu * (n - 1)` instead of `n * m * mu`. This is because the price increase on the last day should be `mu` times the number of days already considered (i.e., `n - 1`), not `n * m * mu`.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program's logic is generally sound and follows the correct approach to minimize the cost by buying tickets on the cheapest days first.
- The cost calculation formulas are mostly derived correctly from the problem constraints, but there is a mistake in the additional cost calculation for the last day when `n * m != k`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the logical error in the additional cost calculation for the last day when `n * m != k`.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
