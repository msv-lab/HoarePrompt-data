### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input and stores them in a list `L`.
   - It also reads the list of ticket prices `a` and stores them in a list `M`.

2. **Constraints Handling:**
   - The function sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that `m` does not exceed the total number of tickets needed `k`.

3. **Sorting and Selection:**
   - The function sorts the list `M` to ensure that the lowest prices are considered first.
   - It calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which represents the number of days needed to buy all `k` tickets, assuming the maximum `m` tickets are bought each day.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means that exactly `m` tickets can be bought on each of the `n` days to meet the total `k` tickets. The cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, where `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means that the last day will have a different number of tickets bought. The function pops the last element from `N` (which is the highest price among the selected days), calculates the number of tickets `mu` that need to be bought on the last day, and then calculates the cost accordingly.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `k` is exactly divisible by `m` and the case where it is not.
   - The function ensures that the list `M` is sorted and the correct number of days and tickets are considered.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Correctness:

The program appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and logic. However, there is a potential issue in the cost calculation when `n * m != k`:

- The formula `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` seems to be incorrect. The term `n * m * mu` should not be added to the cost. Instead, the cost should be calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + mu * w`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + mu * w
        
        print(cost)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, as the loop has iterated `t` times. The variables `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost` will have their final values based on the last test case processed, but these values are not guaranteed to be consistent across different test cases. The list `M` will be sorted and potentially modified by the `.pop()` operation. The variable `cost` will hold the total cost calculated for the last test case. The sum of `n` over all test cases will still not exceed 3 Â· 10^5.
```

### Final Correctness:

Correctness: **False**

The original program has a logical error in the cost calculation when `n * m != k`. The corrected program should be used to ensure the correct minimum cost is calculated.
