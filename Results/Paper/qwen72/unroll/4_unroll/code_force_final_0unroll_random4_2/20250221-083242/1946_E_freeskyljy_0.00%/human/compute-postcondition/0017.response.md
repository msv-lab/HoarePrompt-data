The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is greater than 1. Right before the loop, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than 1, which means `L[-1] - 1` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `L[-1]` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples (n, m_1, m_2, p, s) where each tuple adheres to the initial conditions, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers provided by the user input, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of (N - 1) choose (L[-1] - 1), `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2, `i` is `L[-1] - 1 and must be greater than 1`**
