The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m` and lists `a_i` and `b_i`. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, respectively. The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. Given the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the processing of `a_i` and `b_i`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m` and lists `a_i` and `b_i`. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the processing of these inputs.**
