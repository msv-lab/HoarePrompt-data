The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The loop will execute if `int(input())` is at least 1. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, it is reasonable to assume that `int(input())` is `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1, and the loop index `_` is 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0**
