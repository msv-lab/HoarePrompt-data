Reasoning:

The function `func()` is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum total difference \( D \) between Petya's array \( a \) and Vasya's array \( c \), which is constructed from \( m \) integers \( b \). The function processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it performs the following steps:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \), the lengths of the arrays \( a \) and \( b \) respectively.
   - It reads the elements of array \( a \) and sorts them in ascending order.
   - It reads the elements of array \( b \) and sorts them in descending order.

2. **Calculating Differences:**
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It iterates through the first \( n \) elements of the sorted arrays \( a \) and \( b \).
   - For each element \( a_i \) in \( a \), it calculates the absolute difference with the corresponding element \( b_i \) in \( b \) and appends it to `ans`.
   - It also checks if the absolute difference with the element from the end of \( b \) (i.e., \( b[-(n - i)] \)) is greater than the current difference. If so, it sets a flag `temp` to the current index and breaks the loop.

3. **Adjusting Differences:**
   - If the flag `temp` is set, it means that for some index \( i \), the difference with the element from the end of \( b \) is greater. In this case, it recalculates the differences for the remaining elements starting from the index `temp` using the elements from the end of \( b \).

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the absolute differences stored in `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Sorting:**
  - Sorting \( a \) in ascending order and \( b \) in descending order is a good strategy to maximize the differences. This ensures that the smallest elements of \( a \) are paired with the largest elements of \( b \) and vice versa, which generally maximizes the absolute differences.

- **Difference Calculation:**
  - The function correctly calculates the initial differences between \( a_i \) and \( b_i \).
  - It also checks if the difference with the element from the end of \( b \) is greater, which is a valid approach to maximize the total difference.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases such as when \( n = m \) and when all elements in \( b \) are the same.

- **Optimization:**
  - The function ensures that the maximum possible differences are considered by comparing the differences with both the corresponding and the opposite elements in \( b \).

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference \( D \) between Petya's array \( a \) and Vasya's array \( c \). The execution summary also aligns with the expected behavior of the function.

Correctness: **True**
