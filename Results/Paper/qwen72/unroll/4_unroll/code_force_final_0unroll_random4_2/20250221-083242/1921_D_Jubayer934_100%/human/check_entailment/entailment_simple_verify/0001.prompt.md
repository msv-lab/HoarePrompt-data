You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, which represent the lengths of the arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads `n` integers for array `a` and `m` integers for array `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays**:
   - Array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - Array `b` is sorted in descending order.
   - This sorting is done to maximize the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b`.

3. **Initial Difference Calculation**:
   - The function iterates through the first `n` elements of the sorted `b` array and calculates the absolute differences with the corresponding elements of `a`.
   - These differences are stored in the list `ans`.

4. **Optimization Check**:
   - The function checks if there is a point where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` (the smallest element of `b` that hasn't been used yet) is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` (the largest element of `b` that hasn't been used yet).
   - If such a point is found, it breaks the loop and stores the index `temp`.

5. **Adjusting Differences**:
   - If `temp` is not `-1`, it means there was a point where the smaller elements of `b` can provide a larger difference.
   - The function then iterates from `temp` to `n` and appends the differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to `ans`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.

### Analysis:

- **Sorting**:
  - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order helps in maximizing the absolute differences.
  - This is because the largest elements of `b` will be paired with the smallest elements of `a`, and vice versa, which generally maximizes the differences.

- **Initial Differences**:
  - The initial differences are calculated by pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b`.

- **Optimization**:
  - The function checks if there is a better way to pair elements by comparing the differences with the smallest elements of `b` that haven't been used yet.
  - This is a valid approach because it ensures that the differences are maximized by considering the smallest possible values from `b` for the remaining elements of `a`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the case where `m = n` by simply using the first `n` elements of `b`.
  - It also handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same, which would result in a zero difference if all elements in `a` are the same.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference `D` by sorting the arrays and then optimizing the differences. The approach is sound and should handle all valid inputs as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
