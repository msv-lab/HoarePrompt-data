You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    #State: For each of the t test cases, the loop outputs two strings, kq1 and kq2, which are the result of comparing the digits of the input strings a and b. The first string, kq1, contains the lexicographically smaller digit at each position where the digits differ, and the second string, kq2, contains the lexicographically larger digit at each position where the digits differ. If the digits are the same, they are included in both kq1 and kq2. The values of t, x, and y remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the digits in `x` and `y` are not in the same position but can still be swapped to maximize the product. For example, consider the input:

```
1
3516
3982
```

The program outputs:
```
3912
3586
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
3986
3512
```

By swapping the digits at positions 2 and 3 (0-indexed), the product can be maximized. The program only swaps digits in the same position, which is insufficient to ensure the maximum product in all cases.
