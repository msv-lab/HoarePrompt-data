Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `costs` remains unchanged.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Calculating `h`:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // (n - k + 1)`:
     - `n - k + 1` simplifies to `0 - k + 1` which is `1 - k`.
     - `n // (1 - k)` is `0 // (1 - k)`, which is 0 for any integer value of `k` (since 0 divided by any non-zero integer is 0).
   - `n // 1`:
     - `n // 1` is `0 // 1`, which is 0.
   - Therefore, `h` is the sum of 0 and 0, which is 0.

3. **Condition on `h`:**
   - The initial state also mentions that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Given that `h` is 0, this implies that `k` must be less than or equal to 0.

4. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply prints the integer 2.
   - This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer 2, regardless of the values of `n`, `h`, and `k`.

Output: **2**
