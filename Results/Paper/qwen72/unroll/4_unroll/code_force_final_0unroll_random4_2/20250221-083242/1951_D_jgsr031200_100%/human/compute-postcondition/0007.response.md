Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers.
- Both `n` and `k` are within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\).
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`.

The code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
