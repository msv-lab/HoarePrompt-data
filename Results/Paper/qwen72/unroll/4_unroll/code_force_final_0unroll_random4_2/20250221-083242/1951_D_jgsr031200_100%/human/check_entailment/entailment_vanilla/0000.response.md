### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from one stall if the price is 1.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **Stall Setup:**
   - The program attempts to set up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - The first stall price `n - k + 1` ensures that Alice can buy exactly one jewel from this stall and be left with `k - 1` coins.
   - The second stall price is 1, which allows Alice to buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall using integer division.
   - It sums the number of jewels bought from both stalls and checks if the total is at least `k`.
   - If the total is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - If the total is at least `k`, it prints "YES" and the stall prices.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Base Cases:**
  - When `n == k`, the solution is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from one stall with a price of 1.
  - When `n < k`, the solution is correct because it is impossible for Alice to buy more jewels than she has coins.

- **Correctness of Stall Setup:**
  - The setup with two stalls `[n - k + 1, 1]` is a valid approach:
    - Alice buys 1 jewel from the first stall, spending `n - k + 1` coins.
    - Alice is left with `k - 1` coins, which she can use to buy `k - 1` jewels from the second stall.
  - This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `n == k` and `n < k` correctly.
  - It also handles the case where `k` is 1 by setting up one stall with a price of 1.

- **General Case:**
  - The program correctly sets up two stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
  - The logic for calculating the number of jewels bought from each stall and verifying the total is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach and logic for solving the problem. It correctly handles all the given constraints and edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
