Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. `h` is 0.**

The variable `h` is initialized to 0, while the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `costs` remain unchanged.
