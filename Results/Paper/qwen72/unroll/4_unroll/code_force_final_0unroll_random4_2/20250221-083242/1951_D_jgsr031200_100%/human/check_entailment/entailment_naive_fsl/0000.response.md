Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used in the function `func_1` is flawed. The program attempts to set up only two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`, but this does not always ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
10 5
```
- Alice has 10 coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly 5 jewels.
- According to the program, the stalls will be set up with prices `[10 - 5 + 1, 1]` which is `[6, 1]`.
- At the first stall, Alice can buy 1 jewel (spending 6 coins) and will be left with 4 coins.
- At the second stall, Alice can buy 4 more jewels (spending 4 coins), making a total of 5 jewels.

This works, but the program does not handle cases where `k` is greater than 60 correctly. For example:
```
1
100 61
```
- Alice has 100 coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly 61 jewels.
- The program will set up two stalls with prices `[100 - 61 + 1, 1]` which is `[40, 1]`.
- At the first stall, Alice can buy 2 jewels (spending 40 coins) and will be left with 60 coins.
- At the second stall, Alice can buy 60 more jewels (spending 60 coins), making a total of 62 jewels.

This exceeds the required 61 jewels, and the program does not correctly handle this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
