You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order and prints this count `k`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the lengths of the two binary strings `a` and `b` from the input.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` themselves.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `k` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0, which will be used to track the current position in string `b`.

3. **Loop Through String `a`:**
   - The function iterates through each character in string `a` using a loop indexed by `i`.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it searches for a matching character in string `b` starting from the current position `j`.

4. **Finding Matches:**
   - The inner `while` loop increments `j` until it finds a character in `b` that matches `a[i]` or until `j` reaches the end of `b`.
   - If a match is found (`b[j] == a[i]`), `k` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1 to move to the next character in `b`.
   - If no match is found and `j` reaches the end of `b`, the loop breaks, as it means the current prefix of `a` cannot be extended further as a subsequence in `b`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop completes, the function prints the value of `k`, which is the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the problem by iterating through `a` and checking if each character can be found in `b` in the correct order.
- The use of the `while` loop ensures that the function only increments `k` when a valid match is found, and it stops the search as soon as a character in `a` cannot be matched in `b`.
- The function correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `b` does not contain any '1' (as in the sixth example).

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
