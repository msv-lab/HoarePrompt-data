You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program: 
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: a list of tuples `test_cases` where each tuple contains two binary strings `a` and `b`, and the lengths of `a` and `b` are within the specified ranges. Each binary string consists only of the characters '0' and '1'. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of all `a` and `b` strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: The value of `k` will be the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order, and `j` will be the index in `b` where the loop stopped looking for matches (either because it reached the end of `b` or because it found all matches). The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). The program iterates through each character of string \( a \) and finds the corresponding character in string \( b \) (if it exists). If a character in \( a \) is found in \( b \), it increments \( k \) and moves to the next character in \( b \). If a character in \( a \) is not found in the remaining part of \( b \), the loop breaks, and the program prints \( k \). This logic correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs as described in the problem statement.
