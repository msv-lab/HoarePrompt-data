### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b` from the input.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` themselves.

2. **Algorithm:**
   - The function initializes `k` to 0, which will store the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - It also initializes `j` to 0, which will be used to track the current position in string `b`.
   - The function iterates over each character in string `a` using a for loop.
   - For each character in `a`, it uses a while loop to find the next matching character in `b`. If a match is found, it increments `k` and moves the pointer `j` to the next position in `b`.
   - If the end of `b` is reached without finding a match for the current character in `a`, the function breaks out of the for loop.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the value of `k`, which is the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles cases where `a` is longer than `b` by breaking out of the loop when `j` reaches the end of `b`.
   - It correctly handles cases where `a` and `b` are of the same length.
   - It also handles cases where `b` does not contain any characters that match `a`.

5. **Constraints:**
   - The function adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description, including the limits on the number of test cases and the lengths of the strings.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`. The input handling, algorithm, and output are all consistent with the problem requirements.
