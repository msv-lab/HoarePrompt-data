Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Subsequence Check**: The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`. The logic used in the program is flawed and does not account for all possible subsequences.

2. **Bitmask Logic**: The program uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters, but it does not correctly handle the formation of all possible subsequences of length `n`. The bitmask `cur` is used to track the presence of characters in the string `s`, but it does not ensure that all combinations of length `n` are checked.

3. **Output for NO Case**: The program's logic for generating a string that does not occur as a subsequence in the case of a "NO" answer is incorrect. It does not generate a valid string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the string.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in sub)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        
        # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k alphabets
        all_possible_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
        
        # Check if all possible strings are subsequences of s
        for possible_string in all_possible_strings:
            if not is_subsequence(s, possible_string):
                print('NO')
                print(possible_string)
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **is_subsequence(s, sub)**: This function checks if `sub` is a subsequence of `s` by iterating through `s` and checking if all characters of `sub` appear in `s` in the same order.
- **all_possible_strings**: This list comprehension generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- **Check Subsequences**: The program iterates through all possible strings and checks if each one is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not a subsequence, it prints "NO" and the string. If all strings are subsequences, it prints "YES".

This approach ensures that the program correctly checks for all possible subsequences and handles the "NO" case appropriately.
