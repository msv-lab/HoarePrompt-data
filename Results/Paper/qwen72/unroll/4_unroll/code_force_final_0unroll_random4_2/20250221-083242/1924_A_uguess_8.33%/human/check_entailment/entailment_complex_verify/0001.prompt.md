You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` retain their initial values for each iteration of the outer loop. The variable `cnt` is reset to 0 and `cur` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop. After all iterations of the outer loop, the final values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the loop will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' followed by a string `ans` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a string `s` of length `m` (where `m` is provided but not explicitly used in the function). The function checks if the string `s` contains all possible combinations of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets at least `n` times. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' followed by a string that represents the missing combination to reach `n` occurrences. The function repeats this process for `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer provided at the beginning of the function call. After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to provide one such string that is not a subsequence of `s`.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.
   - The output should be "YES" if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`, otherwise "NO" followed by a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to 0 and `cur` to 0. `cur` is used to track the presence of characters in the current subsequence.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - Converts the character to its corresponding index using `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
     - Checks if the character is not already in the current subsequence using bitwise operations.
     - If the character is not in the current subsequence, it adds it to `cur`.
     - If `cur` covers all `k` characters (i.e., `cur == (1 << k) - 1`), it increments `cnt` and resets `cur`.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.
     - If `cnt >= n`, it prints "YES".
     - If `cnt < n`, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

4. **Issues with the Program**:
   - The logic for constructing the string that is not a subsequence is incorrect.
   - The program uses `cnt` to count the number of times all `k` characters appear in the string, but this does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.
   - The construction of the string in the "NO" case is flawed. It tries to build a string by adding characters that are not in the current subsequence, but this approach does not ensure that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, we print "NO" and that string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, we print "YES".

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not generate and check all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` alphabets. Instead, it uses a flawed approach to count and construct a string, which does not guarantee the correctness of the solution.
