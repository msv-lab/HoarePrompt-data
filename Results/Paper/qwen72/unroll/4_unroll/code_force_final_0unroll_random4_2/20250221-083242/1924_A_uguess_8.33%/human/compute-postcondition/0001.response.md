The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The initial state provided already ensures that `t` is within the range 1 to 10^5, so `t` is already valid for the loop to execute. However, for the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0**
