You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` retain their initial values for each iteration of the outer loop. The variable `cnt` is reset to 0 and `cur` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop. After all iterations of the outer loop, the final values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the loop will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' followed by a string `ans` for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, it fails to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`. Instead, it uses a bitwise approach to track the presence of characters, which is not sufficient to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```
The correct output should be:
```
YES
```
However, the program will output:
```
NO
bb
```
This is incorrect because all possible strings of length 2 formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets (`aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`) are indeed subsequences of `abba`.

### Why the Program Fails:
1. **Bitwise Tracking**: The program uses a bitwise approach to track the presence of characters in the string `s`. This approach is not suitable for checking subsequences of length `n` because it only tracks the presence of characters, not the order or the number of occurrences required to form all possible subsequences of length `n`.

2. **Subsequence Check**: The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. It only increments a counter when it finds a complete set of the first `k` characters, which is not the same as checking all possible combinations of length `n`.

3. **Output of Missing Subsequence**: The program's logic for generating a missing subsequence is flawed. It does not generate a valid string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

To correctly solve this problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as generating all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters and checking if each one is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not a subsequence, it should be printed. If all are subsequences, then "YES" should be printed.
