Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, as provided by the user input. `a` is a binary string provided by the user input. `b` is a binary string provided by the user input. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5. `k` is 0. `j` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `j`, which is now set to 0.
