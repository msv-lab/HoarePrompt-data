You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Output

    2

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are binary strings (strings consisting of the characters '0' and '1'). Additionally, the function should be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: `k` is the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order, `j` is the index in `b` where the loop stopped (either because `b[j]` did not match `a[i]` or because `j` reached `m`), `i` is the last index of `a` that was processed, and `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order up to the point where the loop stopped)

    #The program returns nothing.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). The program iterates through each character in string \( a \) and tries to find a matching character in string \( b \) starting from the current position \( j \). If a match is found, it increments \( k \) and moves to the next character in \( b \). If no match is found for a character in \( a \), the loop breaks, and the program prints the value of \( k \). This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \) for every potential case. The program also handles the input and output format as specified in the problem description.
