You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Output

    2

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order, up to the point where the loop stops (either because `b[j]` does not match `a[i]` or because `j` reaches `m`). The function prints this count `k` and returns nothing. The function is designed to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are read from the input, and the final state of the program after the function concludes is that `k` is printed, and `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Subsequence Check**:
   - The program initializes two variables: `k` to keep track of the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` to keep track of the current position in `b`.
   - It iterates through each character of `a` using a for loop with index `i`.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it uses a while loop to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` starting from position `j`.
   - If it finds a match (`b[j] == a[i]`), it increments `k` and moves `j` to the next position in `b`.
   - If it reaches the end of `b` without finding a match, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, it prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`.
- The use of the while loop inside the for loop ensures that the program efficiently finds the next matching character in `b` for each character in `a`.
- The program handles the case where `b` does not contain a match for a character in `a` by breaking out of the loop, which is the correct behavior.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Strings**: The problem guarantees that `n` and `m` are at least 1, so there are no empty strings to handle.
- **All '0' or '1' Strings**: The program correctly handles these cases by finding the longest prefix that matches.
- **Large Inputs**: The program is efficient enough to handle the maximum constraints (`n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5` and `t \le 10^4`).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
