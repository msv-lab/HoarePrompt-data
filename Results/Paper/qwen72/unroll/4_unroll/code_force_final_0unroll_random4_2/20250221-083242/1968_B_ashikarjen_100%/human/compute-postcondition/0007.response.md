To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `k` is the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order.
- `j` is the index in `b` where the loop stopped, either because `b[j]` did not match `a[i]` or because `j` reached `m`.
- `i` is the last index of `a` that was processed.
- `n` and `m` are the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, and they remain unchanged.
- `a` and `b` are the original strings and remain unchanged.

Given this information, the `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`, which is the number of characters in `a` that matched characters in `b` in the same order up to the point where the loop stopped.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `k`.

Output: **k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order up to the point where the loop stopped)**
