You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are binary strings (strings consisting of the characters '0' and '1'). Additionally, the function should be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `k` is the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order, `j` is the index in `b` where the loop stopped (either because `b[j]` did not match `a[i]` or because `j` reached `m`), `i` is the last index of `a` that was processed, and `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order up to the point where the loop stopped)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It is designed to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, the function processes two binary strings `a` and `b` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
