Output State: **`k` is the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order, `j` is the index in `b` where the loop stopped (either because `b[j]` did not match `a[i]` or because `j` reached `m`), `i` is the last index of `a` that was processed, and `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
