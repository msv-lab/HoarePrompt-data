Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.**

The code initializes a set `visited` with the integer `start`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged. The set `visited` now contains the integer `start`, indicating that the `start` node has been visited.
