The only object in the loop head is `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `queue` is not empty. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. Since `queue` contains at least one element, it is not empty, and the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`**
