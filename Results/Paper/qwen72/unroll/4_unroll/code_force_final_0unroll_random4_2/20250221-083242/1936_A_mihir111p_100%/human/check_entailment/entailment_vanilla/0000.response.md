### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).

3. **Finding the First Maximum Index:**
   - The program initializes `ans1` to 0.
   - It iterates over all indices from 1 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( (p_{\text{ans1}} \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_i) \).
   - If \( (p_{\text{ans1}} \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) < (p_i \mid p_i) \), it updates `ans1` to \( i \).
   - This step ensures that `ans1` is the index of the maximum value in the permutation \( p \).

4. **Finding the Second Maximum Index:**
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to a list containing 0.
   - It iterates over all indices from 1 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( (p_{\text{mx}} \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) \).
   - If \( (p_{\text{mx}} \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) < (p_i \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) \), it updates `mx` to \( i \) and resets `v` to a list containing \( i \).
   - If \( (p_{\text{mx}} \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) = (p_i \mid p_{\text{ans1}}) \), it appends \( i \) to `v`.
   - This step ensures that `v` contains all indices that have the same maximum bitwise OR result with `ans1`.

5. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - The program initializes `mx` to the first element in `v` and `ans` to the first element in `v`.
   - It iterates over the elements in `v` and compares \( (p_{\text{ans}} \mid p_{\text{ans}}) \) with \( (p_{v[i]} \mid p_{v[i]}) \).
   - If \( (p_{\text{ans}} \mid p_{\text{ans}}) > (p_{v[i]} \mid p_{v[i]}) \), it updates `ans` to \( v[i] \).
   - This step ensures that `ans` is the index of the maximum value in the list `v`.

6. **Output the Result:**
   - The program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the answer.

### Analysis:
- The program uses a combination of bitwise OR queries to find the maximum value in the permutation and then to find the indices that maximize the XOR operation.
- The logic for finding the maximum value and the indices that maximize the XOR is sound.
- The number of queries used is \( 2n + (n-1) = 3n - 1 \), which is within the allowed limit of \( 3n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem constraints and logic to find the required indices. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
