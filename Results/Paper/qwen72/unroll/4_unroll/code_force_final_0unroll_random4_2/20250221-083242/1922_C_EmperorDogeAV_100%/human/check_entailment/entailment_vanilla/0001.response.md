### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and the list of city coordinates `cities`.
   - It then reads the number of queries `m` and processes each query.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `prog_cities` to store the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city.
   - For each city `i`, it calculates the distance to the previous city (`back`) and the next city (`forward`).
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating a 1-coin travel to the closest city).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the previous city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are used to store the cumulative costs of traveling to the closest city in the forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly compute the minimum cost for each query.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the starting city `a` is less than the destination city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum to calculate the cost.
   - The cost is calculated as the difference between the prefix sums at the respective indices.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the unique closest city condition.
   - The prefix sums are calculated efficiently, and the queries are processed in O(1) time using these prefix sums.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `func_1` has a logical error. It should only consider the distance to the next city if it exists, and the distance to the previous city if it exists.
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly sets `forward` to `999999999999999999` and `back` to `-99999999999999999999` for all cities, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.
   - The function should correctly handle the edge cases where `i` is 0 or `i` is `n-1`.

### Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the `func_1` function, which incorrectly calculates the cost of traveling to the closest city. Specifically, the conditions for setting `forward` and `back` should be more carefully handled to avoid incorrect results. The correct approach should be to only consider the next city if `i < n-1` and the previous city if `i > 0`.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999 if i == 0 else cities[i - 1]
        forward = 999999999999999999 if i == n - 1 else cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    return prog_cities
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly.
