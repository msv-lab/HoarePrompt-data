The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range of the loop is `n - 1`, and the loop must iterate at least once.

Before the loop starts, the state is:
- `cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each city's coordinate a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9.
- `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each city's coordinate a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0**
