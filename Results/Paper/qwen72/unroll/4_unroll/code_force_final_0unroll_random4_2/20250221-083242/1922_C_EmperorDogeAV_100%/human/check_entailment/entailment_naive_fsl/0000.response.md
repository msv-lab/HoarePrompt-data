Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the closest city and calculating the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. Specifically, the function `func_1` is intended to calculate the cost of moving to the closest city, but it has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City Cost**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the cost of moving to the closest city, but it incorrectly sets the cost to 1 if the forward city is closer, and to the absolute difference otherwise. This does not align with the problem description, which states that moving to the closest city costs 1 coin, and moving to any other city costs the absolute difference in coordinates.

2. **Incorrect Use of Prefix Sums**:
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the incorrect costs from `func_1`. This means that the prefix sums will also be incorrect, leading to incorrect results when calculating the minimum number of coins for each query.

3. **Handling of Backward Cities**:
   - The program reverses the list of cities to calculate the backward costs, but the logic within `func_1` is not symmetric. This means that the backward costs are not calculated correctly, leading to incorrect results for queries where the starting city is greater than the ending city.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program will produce incorrect results because of the issues mentioned above. For example, the cost to travel from city 1 to city 4 should be 3 coins (1 coin to city 2, 1 coin to city 3, and 1 coin to city 4), but the program will likely produce a different result due to the incorrect cost calculations.
