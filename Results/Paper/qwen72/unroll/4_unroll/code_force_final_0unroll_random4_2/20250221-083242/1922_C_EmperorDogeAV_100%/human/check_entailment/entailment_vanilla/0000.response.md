### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is intended to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `prog_cities` with zeros, which will store the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city.
   - For each city `i`, it calculates the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating a 1-coin travel to the closest city).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the closest city.
   - However, there is a logical error in the function. The condition `if i < n - 1` should be `if i < n - 2` because `i + 1` should not exceed `n - 1`.

3. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The program creates two prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` to store the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city in the forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - The prefix sum arrays are correctly initialized with a single zero.
   - The program then iterates through the cities and appends the cumulative cost to the prefix sum arrays.
   - The `backward_cities` array is created by reversing the `cities` list and calling `func_1` again, which is a valid approach to handle the backward direction.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the cities `a` and `b`.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b` using the prefix sum arrays.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum array `pref_sum_f`.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum array `pref_sum_b`.
   - The cost is calculated as the difference between the prefix sums at the respective indices.

### Issues:
- **Logical Error in `func_1`:**
  - The condition `if i < n - 1` should be `if i < n - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.
  - This error will cause the program to incorrectly calculate the closest city for the last city in the list.

### Correctness:
- **False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = input().split()
    for i in range(n):
        cities[i] = int(cities[i])
    forward_cities = func_1(cities, n)
    cities.reverse()
    backward_cities = func_1(cities, n)
    pref_sum_f = [0]
    pref_sum_b = [0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        pref_sum_f.append(pref_sum_f[i] + forward_cities[i])
        pref_sum_b.append(pref_sum_b[i] + backward_cities[i])
    pref_sum_b.reverse()
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(a), int(b))
        if a < b:
            print(pref_sum_f[b - 1] - pref_sum_f[a - 1])
        else:
            print(pref_sum_b[b - 1] - pref_sum_b[a - 1])

def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 2:  # Corrected condition
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    return prog_cities
```

### Final Correctness:
- **False** (due to the logical error in `func_1`)

### Explanation:
- The program is almost correct but has a logical error in the `func_1` function that affects the calculation of the closest city for the last city in the list. This error needs to be fixed to ensure the program works as intended.
