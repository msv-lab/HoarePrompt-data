### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - The city coordinates are converted from a string to a list of integers.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is intended to compute the minimum cost to travel to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `prog_cities` as a list of `n-1` zeros.
   - For each city `i` (except the last one), it calculates the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - If the next city is closer, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating a cost of 1 coin to travel to the closest city).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute difference between the current city and the next city (indicating the cost to travel to the next city).

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for both the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` is calculated for the original list of cities.
   - `pref_sum_b` is calculated for the reversed list of cities and then reversed back to align with the original indices.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the cities `a` and `b`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, it uses the forward prefix sum to calculate the cost.
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it uses the backward prefix sum to calculate the cost.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Distance Calculation in `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` incorrectly sets `forward` to `cities[i + 1]` and `back` to `cities[i - 1]` without considering the absolute differences correctly.
  - The condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):` is incorrect because it should compare the distances to the closest city, not just the next and previous cities.

- **Incorrect Prefix Sum Logic:**
  - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated incorrectly. They should represent the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city, not just the distance to the next city.

- **Incorrect Query Handling:**
  - The program assumes that the cost to travel from city `a` to city `b` is simply the difference in prefix sums, which is not always correct. The correct approach should consider the minimum cost to travel to the closest city and then to the target city.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to travel between cities based on the problem description.

**Correctness: **False****

### Corrected Program:
To correct the program, we need to ensure that the closest city is uniquely determined and that the prefix sums correctly reflect the minimum cost to travel to the closest city. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Compute the closest city for each city
    closest_cities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            closest_cities[i] = 1  # The closest city to the first city is the second city
        elif i == n - 1:
            closest_cities[i] = n - 2  # The closest city to the last city is the second last city
        else:
            if abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]) <= abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]):
                closest_cities[i] = i - 1
            else:
                closest_cities[i] = i + 1
    
    # Compute the prefix sums for the minimum cost to travel to the closest city
    pref_sum = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        pref_sum[i] = pref_sum[i - 1] + abs(cities[i] - cities[closest_cities[i]])
    
    # Handle queries
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        a, b = a - 1, b - 1  # Convert to 0-indexed
        if a < b:
            print(pref_sum[b] - pref_sum[a])
        else:
            print(pref_sum[a] - pref_sum[b])
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Closest City Calculation:**
  - For each city, determine the closest city by comparing the distances to the previous and next cities.
  - Store the index of the closest city in `closest_cities`.

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - Calculate the prefix sum of the minimum cost to travel to the closest city for each city.

- **Query Handling:**
  - For each query, use the prefix sums to calculate the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.

This corrected program should now correctly handle the problem as described.
