### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counter Usage**: The program uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`. This is an efficient way to keep track of how many problems of each difficulty level are available.

3. **Initial Check for Missing Problems**: The program iterates over the string `p = 'ABCDEFG'` to check if any difficulty level is missing from the problem bank. If a difficulty level `i` is not in the `Counter` `hmp`, it means that Vlad has no problems of that difficulty level, and he needs to create `m` problems for each missing difficulty level. This is correctly handled by the line `ans += m`.

4. **Check for Insufficient Problems**: The program then iterates over the `Counter` `hmp` to check if the number of problems for any difficulty level is less than `m`. If so, it calculates the additional number of problems needed to meet the requirement for `m` rounds and adds this to `ans`. This is correctly handled by the line `ans += m - hmp[i]`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with to hold `m` rounds.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where there are no problems of a certain difficulty level or where the number of problems is less than `m` for some difficulty levels.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all the necessary cases. The logic and implementation are sound, and the program should produce the correct output for the given inputs.

### Correctness:
**True**
