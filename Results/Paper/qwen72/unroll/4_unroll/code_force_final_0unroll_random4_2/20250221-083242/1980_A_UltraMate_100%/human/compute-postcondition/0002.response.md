Output State: **t is an input integer, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. The loop has printed the value of ans for each iteration, where ans is the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that are either missing or have a frequency less than m in the string s.**
