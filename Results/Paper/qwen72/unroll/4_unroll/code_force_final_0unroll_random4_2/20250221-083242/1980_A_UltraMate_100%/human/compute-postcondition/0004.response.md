Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of inputs. It first reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function calculates the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that are either missing from `s` or have a frequency less than `m`, and prints this value for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
