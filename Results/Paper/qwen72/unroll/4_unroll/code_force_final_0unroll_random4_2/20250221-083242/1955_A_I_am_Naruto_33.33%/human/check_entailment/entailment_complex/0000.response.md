Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, considering the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. For each test case, the program reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price (`a * n`).
   - `ans2`: The cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price (`b * (n // 2)`) and any remaining yogurt at the regular price (`a * (n % 2)`).
3. It then prints the minimum of these two costs.
4. If `n` is 1, it simply prints the regular price `a` since there is no promotion applicable.

The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by directly printing the regular price `a`. For `n > 1`, the program calculates the cost for buying pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and any remaining yogurt at the regular price, and then compares this with the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price.

The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the program:
- For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`, the minimum cost is `9` (promotion price).
- For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`, the minimum cost is `14` (1 pair at promotion price + 1 at regular price).
- For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`, the minimum cost is `15` (all at regular price).
- For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`, the minimum cost is `20` (2 pairs at promotion price).

The program's logic and output match the problem description and the example test cases.
