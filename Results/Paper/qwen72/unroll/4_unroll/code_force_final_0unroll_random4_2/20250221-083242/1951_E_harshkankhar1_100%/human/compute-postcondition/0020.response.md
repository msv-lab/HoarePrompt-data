Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` contains at least one character different from `s[0]`.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of such a character.
   - The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.
   - `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions from the initial state.
   - It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of the values of `s`, `x`, `n`, or the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])`, the `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
