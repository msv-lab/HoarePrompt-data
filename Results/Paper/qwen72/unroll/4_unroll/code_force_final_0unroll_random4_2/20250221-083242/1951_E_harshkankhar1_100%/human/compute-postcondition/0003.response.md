The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

Let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `x` is -1.
   - `s` is a string provided by the user with a length `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
   - The function `func_1` applied to the entire string `s` returns `False`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
