Postcondition: ***`s` contains at least one character different from `s[0]`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of such a character, and the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, the if part is executed. Otherwise, if `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, the else part is executed, and if `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, the if part is executed. If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, the else part is executed.***
