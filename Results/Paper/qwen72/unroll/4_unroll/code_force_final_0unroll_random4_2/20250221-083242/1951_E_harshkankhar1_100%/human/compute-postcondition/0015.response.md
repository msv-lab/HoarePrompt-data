The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the conditions and values of variables before the code is executed, but these conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `s`, `x`, `n`, or the result of `func_1`.

Output: **YES**
