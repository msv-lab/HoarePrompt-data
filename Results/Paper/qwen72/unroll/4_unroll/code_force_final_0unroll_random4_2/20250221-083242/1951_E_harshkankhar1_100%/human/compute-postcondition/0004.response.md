The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes several variables and conditions:
  - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
  - `x` is -1.
  - `s` is a string provided by the user with a length `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
  - The function `func_1` applied to the entire string `s` returns `False`.

- The `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `1`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
