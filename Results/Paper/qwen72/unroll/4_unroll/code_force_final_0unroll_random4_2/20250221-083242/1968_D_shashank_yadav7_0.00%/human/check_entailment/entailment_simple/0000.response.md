Reasoning:

The program aims to simulate the game described, where Bodya and Sasha start at positions `P_B` and `P_S` in a permutation `p` and an array `a`, and play for `k` turns. The goal is to determine the winner based on their scores after `k` turns.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The program initializes `bm` (Bodya's maximum score) and `sm` (Sasha's maximum score) as the product of the initial score and `k`. This is incorrect because the score should be the sum of the values of `a` at the positions visited over `k` turns, not the product.
   - The loop that updates `bm` and `sm` is also flawed. The line `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` are incorrect. The score should simply be the sum of the values at the positions visited, not a complex maximum calculation involving `k`.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates `n` times, but it should iterate `k` times, as the game lasts for `k` turns.
   - The loop also decrements `k` inside the loop, which is unnecessary and incorrect. The loop should run exactly `k` times.

3. **Incorrect Position Updates:**
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated correctly by moving to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, but the scores are not updated correctly.

### Correct Approach:
- Initialize the scores `bm` and `sm` to 0.
- For each turn, update the scores by adding the value of `a` at the current position.
- Move to the next position in the permutation `p`.
- After `k` turns, compare the scores to determine the winner.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1  # Convert to 0-indexed
        s -= 1  # Convert to 0-indexed
        
        bm = 0  # Initialize Bodya's score
        sm = 0  # Initialize Sasha's score
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bm += a[b]  # Add current position's score to Bodya's score
            sm += a[s]  # Add current position's score to Sasha's score
            b = p[b] - 1  # Move to the next position in the permutation for Bodya
            s = p[s] - 1  # Move to the next position in the permutation for Sasha
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected code should be used to determine the winner of the game correctly.

Correctness: **False**
