Output State: **The loop has finished executing all t iterations. For each iteration, the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, and `a` are processed, and the final comparison between `bm` and `sm` determines the output, which is either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, and `a` remain as they were input, but the loop variables `i`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` are reset for each new test case.**
