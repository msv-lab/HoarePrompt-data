#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer t and for each of the t test cases, it should take an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `tests` times, and for each iteration, it will read `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will check if any character in `c` is not present in `a` or `b`. If such a character is found, it will print 'YES' and break out of the inner loop. If no such character is found, it will print 'NO'. After all iterations, the variables `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `no` will have their final values based on the last test case, and `tests` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if the string `c` is either equal to `a` or `b`. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if any character in `c` is not present in both `a` and `b`. If such a character is found, it prints 'YES' and stops further checks for that test case. If no such character is found, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variables `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `no` will retain their final values from the last test case, and `tests` will remain unchanged.
