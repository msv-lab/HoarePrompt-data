The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. For each of these `t` test cases, it also accepts an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20` and each of `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not provided in the constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
