Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Template Matching Logic**:
   - The program checks if each character in string `c` is not present in strings `a` or `b`. This is not the correct way to determine if a template exists such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.
   - The correct approach should involve checking if there exists a template where:
     - For each position `i`, the characters in `a` and `b` are the same and are different from the character in `c`.
     - If `a_i` and `b_i` are different, no template can be formed because `a` and `b` would not match the same template.

2. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" as soon as it finds a character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b`, which is not the correct condition for the template.
   - It should check the entire string and only print "YES" if a valid template can be formed for all positions.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        # Check if a and b can form a template
        can_form_template = True
        for j in range(slength):
            if a[j] == b[j]:
                if a[j] == c[j]:
                    can_form_template = False
                    break
            else:
                can_form_template = False
                break
        
        if can_form_template:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Initialization**: `can_form_template` is set to `True` initially.
- **Loop through each character**:
  - If `a[j]` and `b[j]` are the same, check if `c[j]` is different from `a[j]` (and `b[j]`). If `c[j]` is the same, set `can_form_template` to `False` and break the loop.
  - If `a[j]` and `b[j]` are different, set `can_form_template` to `False` and break the loop because `a` and `b` cannot match the same template.
- **Output**: Print "YES" if `can_form_template` is `True`, otherwise print "NO".

This solution correctly checks the conditions for the template and ensures that the output is accurate.
