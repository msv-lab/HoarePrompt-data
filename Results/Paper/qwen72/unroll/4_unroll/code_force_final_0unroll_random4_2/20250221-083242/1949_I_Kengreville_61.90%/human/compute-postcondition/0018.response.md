Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is a list of length `n` with all elements unchanged.
- `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements unchanged.
- `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements unchanged.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements unchanged.
- `coef0` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `0`.
- `coef1` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `1`.
- `nodes` is an empty list.
- `ok` is `False` because there is no element in `nodes` for which `c1` is not `0`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this `print` statement, as it is a constant string.

Output: **NO**
