You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Output

    NO
    
Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of
the disks in the desired manner.

    if ok:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

#Function 2:
def dfs(i):
    if not visited[i]:
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a set of disks. It updates the `visited` list to mark disks as visited, appends the indices of visited disks to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists based on the radii and positions of touching disks. The function does not return any value explicitly. After the function concludes, the `visited` list will indicate which disks have been visited, the `nodes` list will contain the indices of all visited disks in the order they were visited, and the `coef0` and `coef1` lists will be updated with coefficients related to the radii adjustments of the touching disks. The `x`, `y`, and `r` lists remain unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where all disks are initially tangent to each other and the radii cannot be changed to strictly decrease the sum of all radii while maintaining tangency. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
0 0 1
2 0 1
1 1 1
```

In this case, the three disks are tangent to each other, and it is not possible to change the radii to strictly decrease the sum of all radii while maintaining tangency. The program, however, does not correctly detect this and might output `YES` incorrectly. The logic in the `dfs` function and the main function `func_1` does not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining the tangency condition for all disks.
