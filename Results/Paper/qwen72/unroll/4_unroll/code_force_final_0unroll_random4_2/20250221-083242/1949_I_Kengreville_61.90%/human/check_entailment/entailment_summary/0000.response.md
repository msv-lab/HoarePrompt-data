### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of disks `n` and their respective coordinates and radii.
   - It initializes several lists: `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`.

2. **DFS and Tangency Check**:
   - `func_1` iterates over each disk and, if it hasn't been visited, starts a DFS from that disk.
   - The DFS function `dfs` is responsible for exploring all disks that are tangent to the current disk.
   - During the DFS, `coef0` and `coef1` are updated based on the tangency conditions. Specifically, `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`.

3. **Sum of Coefficients**:
   - After the DFS, `func_1` calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for the disks in the `nodes` list.
   - If the sum of `coef1` values is not zero, it means there is a way to adjust the radii such that the tangency conditions are maintained and the sum of radii strictly decreases.

4. **Output**:
   - If any DFS results in a non-zero sum of `coef1` values, `func_1` prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:
- **Tangency Condition**: The DFS function correctly identifies disks that are tangent to each other by checking if the squared distance between their centers equals the squared sum of their radii.
- **Coefficient Update**: The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to track the changes in radii. The update rules ensure that the tangency conditions are maintained.
- **Sum Check**: The sum of `coef1` values is used to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases. If the sum is non-zero, it indicates that there is a feasible adjustment.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and ensuring the sum of radii strictly decreases. The DFS ensures that all connected disks are considered, and the coefficient updates ensure that the tangency conditions are maintained.
