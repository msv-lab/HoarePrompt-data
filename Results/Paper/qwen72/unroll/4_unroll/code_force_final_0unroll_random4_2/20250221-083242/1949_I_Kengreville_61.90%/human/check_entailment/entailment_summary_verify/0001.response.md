### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of disks `n` and initializes the arrays `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to store the coordinates, radii, visited status, and coefficients for each disk.
   - It then reads the coordinates and radii for each disk and stores them in the respective arrays.

2. **Graph Representation:**
   - The problem can indeed be thought of as a graph where each disk is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent.
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the graph and determine the coefficients for each disk in a connected component.

3. **DFS and Coefficients:**
   - The `dfs` function correctly marks the disk as visited and appends it to the `nodes` list.
   - It checks all other disks to see if they are tangent by comparing the squared distance between the centers to the squared sum of the radii. This is a correct way to check for tangency.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated to maintain the tangency relationship. Specifically, `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` ensure that the relationship `r[j] = coef0[j] + coef1[j] * r[i]` holds for tangent disks.

4. **Sum of Radii:**
   - After performing the DFS for each connected component, the function calculates the sum of the coefficients `c0` and `c1` for the disks in that component.
   - The key insight is that if `c1` is non-zero for any connected component, it is possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency. This is because a non-zero `c1` indicates that the radii of the disks in the component are not all the same, and thus there is room to adjust them.

5. **Output:**
   - If any connected component has a non-zero `c1`, the function prints `YES`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of DFS:**
  - The DFS correctly identifies all disks that are part of the same connected component (i.e., disks that are tangent to each other directly or indirectly).
  - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are correctly updated to maintain the tangency relationship.

- **Sum of Radii Adjustment:**
  - The key insight that a non-zero `c1` indicates the possibility of decreasing the sum of radii is correct.
  - The logic for updating the coefficients ensures that the tangency relationships are preserved while allowing for the possibility of adjusting the radii.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there are no tangent disks by correctly setting `c1` to zero and printing `NO`.
  - It also handles the case where all disks are tangent to each other in a way that allows for a decrease in the sum of radii.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. The use of DFS to identify connected components and the calculation of coefficients to check for the possibility of decreasing the sum of radii are both sound.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
