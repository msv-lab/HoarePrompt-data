### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Kirill wants to move to a position within the first `m` places in the queue.
   - He can bribe people to move to a position `j` where `j < i` and pay `a_j` coins to the person at position `j`.
   - Additionally, for each person `k` between `j` and `i` (i.e., `j < k < i`), he has to pay `b_k` coins.
   - The goal is to minimize the total number of coins Kirill spends.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` (the number of people in the queue and the maximum position Kirill wants to be in).
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b`, which contain the costs for each person in the queue.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these inputs.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Step 1:** It creates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is because Kirill can either pay `a[i]` to move to position `i` or pay `b[i]` to move past position `i`, and he will choose the cheaper option.
   - **Step 2:** It creates a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` to `c[n-1]`. This helps in quickly calculating the total cost of moving past a certain position.
   - **Step 3:** It initializes `ans` to infinity, which will store the minimum cost.
   - **Step 4:** It iterates over the first `k` positions and calculates the cost of moving to each position `i` as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. This cost includes the cost to move to position `i` (`a[i]`) and the cost to move past all positions from `i+1` to `n-1` (`suff[i + 1]`).
   - **Step 5:** It updates `ans` with the minimum cost found.
   - **Step 6:** It prints the minimum cost `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` places.
   - The use of the suffix sum array `suff` ensures that the cost to move past positions is calculated efficiently.
   - The logic of iterating over the first `k` positions and choosing the minimum cost is correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is 1 correctly, as it will only consider the cost to move to the first position.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

**Correctness: True**
