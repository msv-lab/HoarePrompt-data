Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The list `c` is created where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This step is correct because it ensures that Kirill will always pay the minimum cost to move past any person.
   - The suffix sum array `suff` is computed. `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`. This is done correctly by iterating from `n-1` to `0` and accumulating the sum.

3. **Finding the Minimum Cost**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity to ensure that any valid cost will be smaller.
   - The program iterates over the first `k` positions and calculates the cost for Kirill to move to position `i` as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. This is the cost to move to position `i` plus the cost to move past all people from `i+1` to `n-1`.
   - The minimum of these costs is stored in `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the value of `ans`.

The logic of the program is sound and aligns with the problem description. The preprocessing and the cost calculation steps are implemented correctly. The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described.

Correctness: **True**
