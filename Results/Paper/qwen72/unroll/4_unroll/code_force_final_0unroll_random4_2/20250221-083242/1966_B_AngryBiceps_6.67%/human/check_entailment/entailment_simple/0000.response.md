### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in the list `a`.

2. **Conditions for Output:**
   - The program checks two main conditions to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color:
     - **First Condition:** `if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]`
       - This checks if the first row is entirely one color (either 'W' or 'B') and if the first row is different from the last row.
       - If this condition is true, it prints 'NO' because if the first and last rows are different and the first row is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
     - **Second Condition:** `elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row`
       - This checks if the first column is entirely one color and if the first column is different from the last column.
       - If this condition is true, it prints 'NO' because if the first and last columns are different and the first column is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
     - **Else Condition:** `else`
       - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'YES' because the grid can be made entirely one color by performing the operations described in the problem.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the grid is a single row or a single column correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the grid is already entirely one color correctly.

4. **Correctness of Conditions:**
   - The conditions are logically sound and cover the necessary cases to determine if the grid can be made entirely one color.
   - The program does not need to simulate the operations; it only needs to check the initial configuration of the grid.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the conditions it checks. It correctly identifies whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of operations.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
