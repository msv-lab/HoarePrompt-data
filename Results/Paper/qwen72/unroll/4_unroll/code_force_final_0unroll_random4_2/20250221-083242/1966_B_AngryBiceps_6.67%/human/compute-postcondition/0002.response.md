Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from stdin, where the input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines each containing `m` characters 'W' or 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The function processes each test case and outputs the results to stdout.**
