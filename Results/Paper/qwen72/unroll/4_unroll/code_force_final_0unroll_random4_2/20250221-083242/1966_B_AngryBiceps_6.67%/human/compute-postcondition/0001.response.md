Output State: **The loop reads the input for each test case, processes the grid, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified. After all iterations, the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` will have their final values corresponding to the last test case processed. The variable `t` will be unchanged as it is only used to determine the number of iterations.**
