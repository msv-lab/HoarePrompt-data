Output State: **The loop has processed `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has printed either `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, or `n - 1` otherwise. The variables `n` and `k` are updated for each test case based on the input provided, and `i` iterates from 0 to `t-1`. The final value of `i` will be `t-1`.**
