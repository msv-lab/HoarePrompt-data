Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). Additionally, the function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).**

However, the function definition provided is:
```
def func():
```
This does not match the problem description, as the function should take two parameters, `n` and `k`. The correct function definition should be:
```
def func(n, k):
```

Given this, the correct precondition for the function `func(n, k)` is:
**n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2.**
