Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise it prints `n - 1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is that `t` results have been printed, one for each test case. **
