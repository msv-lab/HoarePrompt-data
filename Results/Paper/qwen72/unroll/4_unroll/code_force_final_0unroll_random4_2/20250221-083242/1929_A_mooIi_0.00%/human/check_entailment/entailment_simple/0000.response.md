Reasoning:  
The program provided does not solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the program simply sorts the array and prints the sorted array. This does not compute the maximum beauty as required.

To achieve the maximum beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. One effective way to do this is to sort the array in ascending order and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the program does not perform this calculation.

Additionally, the program converts the sorted array elements to strings and joins them with spaces, which is not the correct output format. The output should be a single integer representing the maximum beauty for each test case.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
