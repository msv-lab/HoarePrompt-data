Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem description. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, which is not the correct output. The problem requires calculating the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n` after rearranging the elements to maximize this sum. The program fails to perform this calculation and instead prints the sorted array, which is not the beauty value.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Compute the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for the sorted array.
3. Print the computed sum for each test case.

The provided program only performs the first step and then prints the sorted array, which is not the required output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
