Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem description. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, which is not the correct output. The problem requires calculating the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n` after rearranging the elements to maximize this sum. The program fails to perform this calculation and instead prints the sorted array, which is not the expected output.

For example, with the input:
```
5
3
2 1 3
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program will print `1 2 3`, which is incorrect.

The correct approach would involve:
1. Sorting the array.
2. Calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
3. Printing the result of this calculation.

Since the program does not perform these steps, it is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
