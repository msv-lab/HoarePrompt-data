Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem description. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, which is not the correct output. The problem requires calculating the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n` after rearranging the elements to maximize this sum. The program fails to perform this calculation and instead prints the sorted array, which is incorrect.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the problem description:
```
5
3
2 1 3
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program will print:
```
1 2 3
```
This output is the sorted array, not the maximum beauty value. The correct approach would involve sorting the array and then computing the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, or finding another arrangement that maximizes the beauty.

Given this, the original assessment is correct, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
