The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is designed to process multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of a matrix. The function should handle up to 500 test cases, and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5. The function returns the result of processing these test cases, but the specific output is not provided in the problem description.
