### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - We can perform two types of operations: 
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), then assign \( a_{i, j} = p_j \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), then assign \( a_{j, i} = p_j \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Solution Analysis**:
   - The program initializes the matrix with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \) for each row.
   - The sum of all elements in the matrix is calculated as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \).
   - The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \).
   - For each \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, the program performs a Type 1 operation on row \( i \) and a Type 2 operation on column \( i \), both using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum calculation \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \) is incorrect. The correct sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for each row and column should be \( n \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

4. **Operations**:
   - The program performs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each operation uses the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which is a valid permutation.
   - The operations are correctly formatted and follow the problem's constraints.

5. **Matrix State After Operations**:
   - After performing the operations, each row and each column will be filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This ensures that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values, but the sum calculation is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program performs the operations correctly and within the allowed limit, but the sum calculation is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
