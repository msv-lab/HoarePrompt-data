Precondition: **The function `func` does not take any input parameters. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function will be used in a context where it processes multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix. The function should be able to handle up to 500 test cases, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5.**
