### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the size of the matrix.

2. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - The matrix `mat` is initialized as an `n x n` matrix where each row is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - This initialization is correct and aligns with the problem's requirement for permutations.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The variable `res` is used to store the maximum possible sum of the matrix.
   - The formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is used to calculate the sum. This formula is derived from the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the matrix.
   - The formula is correct for calculating the maximum sum of the matrix. For a matrix of size `n x n`, the maximum sum is achieved by filling the matrix with the largest possible values, which are the integers from 1 to `n` repeated `n` times. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) / 2`, and each number appears `n` times in the matrix, so the total sum is `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2) = n^2 * (n + 1) / 2`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `n << 1` (which is `2 * n`).
   - This is correct because the problem allows up to `2 * n` operations, and the function ensures that it uses exactly `2 * n` operations.

5. **Operations**:
   - The function performs `2 * n` operations, where for each `i` from `n` to `1` in descending order:
     - It performs a Type 1 operation on row `i` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - It performs a Type 2 operation on column `i` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - These operations are correct and ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

6. **Matrix Filling**:
   - The operations fill the matrix with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` in both rows and columns, which is the optimal way to maximize the sum of the matrix.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, calculates the maximum sum, and performs the required operations to achieve the maximum sum. The number of operations used is within the allowed limit of `2 * n`.

**Correctness: True**
