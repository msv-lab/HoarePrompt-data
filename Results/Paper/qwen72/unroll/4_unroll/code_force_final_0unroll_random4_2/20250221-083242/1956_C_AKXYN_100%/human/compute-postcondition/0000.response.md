The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter, and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but the context implies that the function will be used in a way that it processes multiple test cases. Therefore, the number of test cases must be provided as input to the loop.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
