The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. However, based on the problem description, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, and the loop is intended to iterate over the range of `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` should start at 0, as it is the initial value for the range function.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `i` is 0**
