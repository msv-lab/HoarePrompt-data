Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers `p` of length `n` where each `p_i` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all `p_i` are distinct) represents the best friend of the i-th friend. The function should calculate and return the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. However, the function definition provided does not include parameters for the input values, which are necessary to solve the problem as described. `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
