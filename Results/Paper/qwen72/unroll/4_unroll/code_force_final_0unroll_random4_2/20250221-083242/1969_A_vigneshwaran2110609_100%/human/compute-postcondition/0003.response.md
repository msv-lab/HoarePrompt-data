The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers `p` of length `n` where each `p_i` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all `p_i` are distinct) represents the best friend of the i-th friend. The function should calculate and return the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. However, the function definition provided does not include parameters for the input values, which are necessary to solve the problem as described.

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept two parameters: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `p` of length `n` where each `p_i` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all `p_i` are distinct). It should return the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.**
