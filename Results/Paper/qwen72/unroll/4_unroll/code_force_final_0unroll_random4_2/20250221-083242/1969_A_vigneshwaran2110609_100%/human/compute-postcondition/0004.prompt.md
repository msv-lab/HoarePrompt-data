You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers `p` of length `n` where each `p_i` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all `p_i` are distinct) represents the best friend of the i-th friend. The function should calculate and return the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. However, the function definition provided does not include parameters for the input values, which are necessary to solve the problem as described.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. If for any `i` in the range `[0, x)`, `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is true, the loop prints `2` and breaks. Otherwise, after completing the inner loop, it prints `3`. The variables `x`, `l`, and `flag` are updated within the loop, but their final values are not predictable without the specific inputs. The loop does not modify `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is intended to accept two parameters: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `p` of length `n` where each `p_i` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all `p_i` are distinct). It should return the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
