### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a logical error in the program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, where `b` is the number of moves and `c` is the desired number of cubes in the tower.

2. **Conditions:**
   - **If `b == c`:** This condition checks if the number of moves is equal to the desired number of cubes. If true, the answer is "Yes" because Nikita can simply add `c` cubes in `c` moves.
   - **If `b < c`:** This condition checks if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes. If true, the answer is "No" because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - **If `a % 2 == b % 2`:** This condition is incorrect. It checks if the parity (odd or even) of the number of test cases `a` is the same as the parity of the number of moves `b`. This is not relevant to the problem. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2` to check if the parity of the number of moves `b` is the same as the parity of the desired number of cubes `c`.
   - **Else:** If none of the above conditions are met, the answer is "No".

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - **If `n` is equal to `m`:** The answer is "Yes" because Nikita can add exactly `m` cubes in `m` moves.
   - **If `n` is less than `m`:** The answer is "No" because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - **If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd):** The answer is "Yes" because Nikita can achieve the desired number of cubes by adding or removing cubes in such a way that the parity of the number of moves matches the parity of the desired number of cubes.
   - **Otherwise:** The answer is "No" because the parity of the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must match for it to be possible.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1: `n = 3`, `m = 3`**
  - `b == c` is true, so the program correctly prints "Yes".
- **Test Case 2: `n = 2`, `m = 4`**
  - `b < c` is true, so the program correctly prints "No".
- **Test Case 3: `n = 5`, `m = 3`**
  - `b == c` is false.
  - `b < c` is false.
  - The program checks `a % 2 == b % 2`, which is incorrect. It should check `b % 2 == c % 2`.
  - Since `a % 2 == b % 2` is false (assuming `a` is not necessarily the same parity as `b`), the program prints "No", which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program contains a logical error in the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`. The correct condition should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`.

**Final: False**
