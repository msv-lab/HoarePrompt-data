Output State: **The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged. The loop iterates `a` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `b` and `c`, it prints 'YES' if `b == c`, 'NO' if `b < c`, 'Yes' if `a % 2 == b % 2`, and 'No' otherwise. The variables `b`, `c`, and `q` are updated in each iteration, but their final values are not defined as they depend on the last input provided.**
