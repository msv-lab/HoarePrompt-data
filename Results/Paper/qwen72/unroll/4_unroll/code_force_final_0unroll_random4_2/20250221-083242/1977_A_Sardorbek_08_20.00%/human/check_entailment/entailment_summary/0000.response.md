Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `b` and `c` for each case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The first condition checks if `b` is equal to `c`. If `b` is equal to `c`, it means Nikita can build a tower of exactly `m` cubes in `n` moves by simply adding a cube `m` times. This is correct.
   - The second condition checks if `b` is less than `c`. If `b` is less than `c`, it means Nikita cannot build a tower of `m` cubes in `n` moves because he would need more moves to add more cubes. This is also correct.
   - The third condition checks if `a % 2` is equal to `b % 2`. This is incorrect. The condition should be checking if `b % 2` is equal to `c % 2` instead. The parity of `n` (number of moves) and `m` (number of cubes) should be the same for it to be possible to build the tower. If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it is possible to build the tower. If they have different parities, it is not possible.
   - The fourth condition is the else case, which will print 'No' if none of the above conditions are met. This is correct but relies on the incorrect third condition.

3. **Output**: The function prints 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' based on the conditions. The output is case-insensitive, so both 'YES' and 'Yes' are acceptable as positive answers.

Given the above reasoning, the third condition is incorrect, which means the program will not always produce the correct output.

Correctness: **False**
