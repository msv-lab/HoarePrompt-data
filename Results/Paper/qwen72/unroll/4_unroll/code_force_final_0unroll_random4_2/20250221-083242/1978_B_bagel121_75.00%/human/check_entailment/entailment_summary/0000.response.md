Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the function prints `n * a`. This is correct because if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price to maximize profit.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, the function calculates the optimal `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This is correct because `k` should be the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without making the price of any bun less than `a`. The formula `b - a + 1` ensures that the price of the last modified bun is at least `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series, which is correct. The sum of the first `k` integers starting from `b` is given by the formula \(\frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1))\).
   - The function then calculates the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` using the formula `(n - k) * a`.
   - Finally, it prints the total profit, which is the sum of the two calculated profits.

4. **Output**: The function correctly prints the maximum profit for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is very large (up to \(10^9\)) and `a` and `b` are also large (up to \(10^9\)).
   - It also handles the case where `a` is equal to `b` by printing `n * a`, which is correct.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

Correctness: **True**
