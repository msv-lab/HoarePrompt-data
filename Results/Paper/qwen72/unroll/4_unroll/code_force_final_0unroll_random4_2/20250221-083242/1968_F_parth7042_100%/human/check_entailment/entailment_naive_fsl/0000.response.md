Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in the way it checks if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the condition `(v1[it1] < v2[it2])` is not sufficient to determine if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
5 1
1 2 3 4 5
1 5
```
The prefix XOR array `pf` will be:
```
[0, 1, 3, 0, 4, 1]
```
For the query `(1, 5)`, the program will calculate:
```
x = pf[5] ^ pf[0] = 1 ^ 0 = 1
```
Since `x != 0`, the program will check:
```
v1 = mp[pf[5]] = mp[1] = [1, 5]
v2 = mp[pf[0]] = mp[0] = [0, 3]
```
The program will then find:
```
it1 = bisect_left(v1, 1) = 0
it2 = bisect_left(v2, 5) - 1 = 1
```
Since `v1[0] < v2[1]` (1 < 3), the program will output "YES" for this query. However, the subarray `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` cannot be split into parts with equal XOR values, so the correct output should be "NO".

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this input, and the correctness is **False**.
