Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `index` is defined as `1 + 2 * t + 2 * (n + q)`.
   - `results` is a list of strings containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement uses the `join` method to concatenate all elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - Since `results` is a list of strings containing 'YES' or 'NO', the output will be a string where each 'YES' or 'NO' is on a new line.

4. **Output**:
   - The exact number of 'YES' or 'NO' entries in the `results` list is not specified, so we can't determine the exact number of lines in the output.
   - However, we know that each element in the `results` list will be printed on a new line.

Therefore, the output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each on a new line, corresponding to the elements in the `results` list.

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (each on a new line, corresponding to the elements in the `results` list)**
