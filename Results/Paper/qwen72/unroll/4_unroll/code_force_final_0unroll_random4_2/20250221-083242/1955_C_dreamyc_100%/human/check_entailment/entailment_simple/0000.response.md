### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function first checks if the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities. If so, it returns `n` because all ships will be sunk.
   - If `k` is less than the sum of all ship durabilities, the function proceeds to calculate the number of ships sunk.

3. **Attack Calculation**:
   - The function calculates two values: `a` and `b`.
     - `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2`, which represents the number of attacks on the first ship.
     - `b` is the integer division of `k` by 2, which represents the number of attacks on the last ship.
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of ships sunk.
   - It also initializes `s_a` and `s_b` to 0, which will store the cumulative durability of the first and last ships, respectively.

4. **Loop Through Ships**:
   - The function iterates through the list of ship durabilities.
   - For each ship, it adds the durability to `s_a` and `s_b` (for the first and last ships, respectively).
   - If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, it increments `ans` by 1, indicating that the first ship has been sunk.
   - If `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, it increments `ans` by 1, indicating that the last ship has been sunk.

5. **Return Result**:
   - The function returns `ans`, which is the total number of ships sunk.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation of `s_a` and `s_b`**:
  - The variables `s_a` and `s_b` are not correctly used to track the cumulative durability of the first and last ships. Instead, they are being used to sum the durabilities of all ships, which is not the intended behavior.
  - The loop should be designed to simulate the attacks on the ships in the specified order (first, last, first, last, etc.), and the durabilities should be decremented accordingly.

- **Incorrect Logic for Sunk Ships**:
  - The logic for determining if a ship is sunk is flawed. The program should check if the current ship's durability is less than or equal to the number of attacks it has received, not if the cumulative sum of durabilities is less than or equal to `a` or `b`.

### Correct Approach:
- **Simulate Attacks**:
  - Use a deque to simulate the attacks on the ships. Deque allows efficient popping from both ends.
  - Simulate the attacks by decrementing the durability of the first and last ships in alternating order.
  - Count the number of ships that have a durability of 0 or less.

### Correctness:
- The given program does not correctly simulate the attacks on the ships and does not accurately count the number of ships sunk. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
