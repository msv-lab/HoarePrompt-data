Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly simulate the attacks on the ships as described in the problem. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed because it does not properly account for the alternating attacks on the first and last ships, and it does not handle the removal of ships that have sunk. Instead, it attempts to sum the durabilities of the ships and check against the number of attacks, which does not accurately reflect the sequence of attacks and the condition of the ships after each attack.

Here is a corrected version of the program that simulates the attacks correctly:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums = deque(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    sunk = 0
    while k > 0 and nums:
        # Attack the first ship
        if nums[0] > 0:
            nums[0] -= 1
            if nums[0] == 0:
                nums.popleft()
                sunk += 1
                n -= 1
        k -= 1
        if k == 0 or not nums:
            break
        
        # Attack the last ship
        if nums[-1] > 0:
            nums[-1] -= 1
            if nums[-1] == 0:
                nums.pop()
                sunk += 1
                n -= 1
        k -= 1
    return sunk
```

This version uses a `deque` to efficiently manage the ships, allowing for the removal of ships from both the front and the back. It simulates each attack in the correct order and updates the state of the ships accordingly. The loop continues until either all attacks are performed or all ships have sunk. The number of sunk ships is tracked and returned as the result.
