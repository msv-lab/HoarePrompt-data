The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the number of elements in the list `nums` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `nums`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of elements in `nums` that contribute to the prefix sum being less than or equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)` and the number of elements that contribute to the suffix sum being less than or equal to `k // 2`.
