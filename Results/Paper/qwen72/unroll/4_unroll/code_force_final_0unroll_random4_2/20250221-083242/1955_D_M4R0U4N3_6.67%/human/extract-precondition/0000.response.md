Precondition: **The function should accept three parameters: n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and two lists of integers: a (length n, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) and b (length m, 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6). The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is given (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def count_good_subsegments(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as described in the problem. For example:

```python
test_cases = [
    (7, 4, 2, [4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4]),
    (7, 4, 3, [4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4]),
    # ... other test cases
]
```
