Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - It initializes a set `todo` with the elements of array `b`.
   - It initializes sets `done` and `extra` to keep track of elements that match and do not match the elements in `todo`, respectively.
   - It processes the first `m` elements of array `a` to populate `done` and `extra` sets.

3. **Counting Good Subsegments**:
   - It starts with the initial subsegment and checks if the number of matching elements (`len(done)`) is at least `k`. If so, it increments the answer `ans`.
   - It then iterates through the rest of the array `a` to check each subsequent subsegment of length `m`.
   - For each new element added to the subsegment, it updates the sets `done` and `extra` by removing the oldest element from the current subsegment and adding the new element.
   - It checks if the updated subsegment has at least `k` matching elements and increments `ans` if it does.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments for a test case, it prints the number of good subsegments.

The logic is sound and the program should correctly count the number of good subsegments for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
