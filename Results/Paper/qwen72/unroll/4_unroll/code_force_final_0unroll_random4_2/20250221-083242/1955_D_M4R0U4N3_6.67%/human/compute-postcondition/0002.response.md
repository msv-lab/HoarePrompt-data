The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer representing the length of list `a` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
  - `m`: an integer representing the length of list `b` (1 ≤ m ≤ n).
  - `k`: an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ m).
  - `a`: a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).
  - `b`: a list of integers of length `m` (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6).

The function processes each test case and returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It processes each test case and returns a list of results, where each result is based on the given parameters and lists for that test case.**
