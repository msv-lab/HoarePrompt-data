Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the number of valid segments of length `m` in the list `a` where at least `k` elements from the list `b` are present. The function prints the result for each test case. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans` are reset and reinitialized for each test case, so they do not retain their values between test cases. After processing all test cases, the program has finished executing. **
