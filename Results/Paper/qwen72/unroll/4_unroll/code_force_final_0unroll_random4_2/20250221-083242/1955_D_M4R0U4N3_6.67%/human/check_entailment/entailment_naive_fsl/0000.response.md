Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the elements in array `b` are not unique. According to the problem description, elements of array `b` are not necessarily unique, but the program uses sets to track the elements, which inherently removes duplicates. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
7 4 3
4 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 2 3
```
The correct output should be `3` because the subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, and 3 are good. However, the program will output `2` because it treats the duplicate `2` in array `b` as a single element, leading to incorrect counting of good subsegments.
