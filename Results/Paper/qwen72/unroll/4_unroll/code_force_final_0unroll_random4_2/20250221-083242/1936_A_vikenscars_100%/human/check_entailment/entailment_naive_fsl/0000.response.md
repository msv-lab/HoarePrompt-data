Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` to find the maximum XOR pair is flawed. The program assumes that the maximum XOR pair can be found by first identifying the maximum item index and then finding the best pair index relative to the maximum item index. However, this approach does not guarantee that the maximum XOR pair is found.

Consider the following example:
- **Permutation**: `p = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
- **Expected Maximum XOR Pair**: `p_0 \oplus p_3 = 0 \oplus 3 = 3` (or `p_1 \oplus p_2 = 1 \oplus 2 = 3`)

The program will:
1. Identify `max_item_idx` as 3 (since 3 is the largest number in the permutation).
2. Try to find the best `pair_idx` by comparing `p_3 \mid p_3` with `p_3 \mid p_i` for all `i`.

However, the program will not correctly identify the pair `(0, 3)` or `(1, 2)` as the maximum XOR pair because it only considers pairs involving `max_item_idx` and does not explore all possible pairs.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should explore all possible pairs of indices to ensure it finds the maximum XOR pair, or use a more sophisticated approach that guarantees the correct result within the query limit.
