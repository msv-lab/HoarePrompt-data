The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer with the constraint that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function returns a value based on the input `n`. However, the specific output conditions are not provided in the given information. To accurately describe the functionality, we need to infer from the typical behavior of such functions. Given the constraint on `n`, a common functionality might be to return a boolean indicating whether `n` is a prime number, or to return a list of prime numbers up to `n`, or some other mathematical property or operation. Since the exact output is not specified, we will describe the function in a general way.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and returns a value based on the input `n`.**
