### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries of the form \( ? \ a \ b \ c \ d \), which returns a comparison between \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b, c, d)`**:
   - This function sends a query to the interactor and returns the result.
   - It constructs the query string and prints it with `flush=True` to ensure it is sent immediately.
   - It then reads the input from the interactor, which is either '<', '>', or '='.
   - This function is correct as it follows the interaction protocol.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(n)`**:
   - **Finding the Maximum Item**:
     - The function starts by assuming the maximum item is at index 0 (`max_item_idx = 0`).
     - It iterates through the indices from 1 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( p_{max_item_idx} \) with \( p_i \) using the query \( ? \ max_item_idx \ max_item_idx \ i \ i \).
     - If the result is '<', it updates `max_item_idx` to \( i \). This ensures that `max_item_idx` always points to the index of the maximum item in the permutation.
     - **Note**: The comparison \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) with \( (p_c \mid p_d) \) is not directly useful for finding the maximum item in the permutation. Instead, it is used to find the maximum value of \( p_i \) in the permutation. This is because \( p_i \mid p_i = p_i \).

   - **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR**:
     - After finding the maximum item, the function initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
     - It iterates through all indices from 0 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( (p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}) \) with \( (p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i) \) using the query \( ? \ max_item_idx \ pair_idx \ max_item_idx \ i \).
     - If the result is '<', it updates `pair_idx` to \( i \).
     - If the result is '=', it further compares \( (p_{pair_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_i) \) using the query \( ? \ pair_idx \ pair_idx \ i \ i \).
     - If the result of the second comparison is '>', it updates `pair_idx` to \( i \).
     - **Note**: The logic here is to find the index \( i \) such that \( p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i \) is maximized. This is not directly related to maximizing \( p_i \oplus p_j \). The bitwise OR operation does not help in finding the maximum XOR.

4. **Query Analysis**:
   - The first loop to find the maximum item uses \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The second loop to find the pair with the maximum XOR uses \( n \) queries.
   - The total number of queries is \( (n-1) + n = 2n - 1 \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

5. **Correctness**:
   - The function correctly identifies the maximum item in the permutation.
   - However, the logic for finding the pair with the maximum XOR is flawed. The bitwise OR operation does not help in finding the maximum XOR. The maximum XOR is not necessarily achieved by the maximum item in the permutation.
   - The function may not always find the correct pair of indices that maximizes \( p_i \oplus p_j \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the logic for finding the pair with the maximum XOR is flawed. The function may not always return the correct indices that maximize \( p_i \oplus p_j \).

Final: **False**
