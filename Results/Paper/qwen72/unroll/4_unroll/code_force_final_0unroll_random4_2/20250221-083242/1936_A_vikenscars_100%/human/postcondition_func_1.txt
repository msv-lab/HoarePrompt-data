The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. It determines the index of the largest item in the range 0 to n-1 using a comparison function `func_1`. After the function concludes, it prints the indices of two items: `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`. `max_item_idx` is the index of the largest item found in the range 1 to n-1, and `pair_idx` is the index of the largest item in the range 0 to n-1. The final state of the program includes the printed output in the format `! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]`.
