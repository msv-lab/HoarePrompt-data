Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in a secret permutation p is maximized. The solution must use at most 3n queries, each of which compares the bitwise OR of two elements with the bitwise OR of two other elements.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` is responsible for sending a query and receiving the result.
- It takes four indices (a, b, c, d) and prints a query in the format `"? {a} {b} {c} {d}"`.
- It then reads the response from the input, which should be one of `<`, `=`, or `>`.
- This function is correctly implemented and matches the problem's requirements for interaction.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` is the main function that attempts to find the pair of indices (i, j) with the maximum XOR value.
- The function first tries to find the index of the largest element in the permutation using a series of queries. It does this by comparing the bitwise OR of the current `max_item_idx` with itself against the bitwise OR of each other index with itself. If the result is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to the new index.
- After finding the `max_item_idx`, the function then tries to find the `pair_idx` that, when XORed with `max_item_idx`, gives the maximum value. It does this by comparing the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` with the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` and each other index. If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to the new index. If the result is `=`, it further checks the bitwise OR of `pair_idx` with itself against the bitwise OR of the new index with itself to ensure the correct `pair_idx` is chosen.

### Issues:
1. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The function `func_2` is attempting to find the maximum element in the permutation by comparing the bitwise OR of each element with itself. However, this approach is flawed because the bitwise OR of an element with itself is always the element itself. Therefore, the comparison `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` is essentially comparing `p[max_item_idx]` with `p[i]`, which is not the same as finding the maximum element in the permutation.

2. **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR**:
   - The function `func_2` is not correctly identifying the pair with the maximum XOR value. It is using a similar flawed approach to find `pair_idx`, which is not guaranteed to maximize the XOR with `max_item_idx`.

### Conclusion:
The logic in `func_2` is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the maximum element or the pair with the maximum XOR value. The approach of comparing the bitwise OR of an element with itself is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
