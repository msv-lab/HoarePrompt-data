Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where the scores are such that the maximum number of draws is less than the sum of the minimum scores. For example, consider the input `1 2 3`. The correct output should be `2`, but the program incorrectly outputs `3`.

Let's break down the issue with the input `1 2 3`:
- The total points are `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is even, so the scores are consistent with the rules.
- The maximum number of draws should be the sum of the minimum scores, which is `1 + 2 = 3` (since each draw gives 1 point to each player).
- However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of draws as `3`, which is not the maximum possible number of draws.

The correct output for `1 2 3` should be `2`, because the only way to achieve these scores is with 2 draws and 1 win/loss game:
- Two draws: `1 1 2` (both players get 1 point each in each draw).
- One win/loss game: `1 2 3` (the third player wins against the second player).

Thus, the program is incorrect.
