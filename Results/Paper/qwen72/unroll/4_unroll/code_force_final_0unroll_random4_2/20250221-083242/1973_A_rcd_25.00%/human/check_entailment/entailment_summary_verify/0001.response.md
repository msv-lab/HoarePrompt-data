### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the total sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in case of a win/loss or 2 points in case of a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is correct and necessary.

3. **Case where `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`:**
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest scorer `p3` could have drawn all games with the other two players, and the other two players could have drawn all games with each other.
   - This logic is correct because in this scenario, the total points can be distributed such that the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`.

4. **Case where `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`:**
   - The program calculates the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores: `low = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)` and `high = max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid number of draws. The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is used to check if the current number of draws `cur` is valid.
   - If a valid number of draws is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - If no valid number of draws is found, it prints `p3`.

   **Analysis of the Logic for `p3 < p1 + p2`:**
   - The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is intended to ensure that the remaining points after accounting for `cur` draws can be distributed such that the scores are consistent.
   - However, this condition is not well-justified and might be incorrect. The correct approach should be to ensure that the remaining points can be distributed in a way that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

   **Correct Approach:**
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, we need to find the maximum number of draws `d` such that the remaining points can be distributed in a way that the scores are consistent.
   - The total number of points is `p1 + p2 + p3`. If `d` is the number of draws, then the total number of points from wins and losses is `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2d`.
   - The number of wins and losses should be even, and the remaining points should be distributed such that `p1 - d`, `p2 - d`, and `p3 - d` are non-negative and consistent with the rules.
   - The correct condition to check is if `(p1 + p2 + p3 - 2d) % 2 == 0` and `p1 - d + p2 - d + p3 - d == (p1 + p2 + p3 - 2d) / 2`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`), correctly printing `0`.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (e.g., `1 1 1`), correctly printing `-1`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the initial check and the case where `p3 >= p1 + p2`.
- However, the logic for the case where `p3 < p1 + p2` is flawed. The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws. The correct approach should involve ensuring that the remaining points can be distributed in a way that the scores are consistent.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is not entirely correct. The logic for the case where `p3 < p1 + p2` needs to be re-evaluated and corrected.

Final: **False**
