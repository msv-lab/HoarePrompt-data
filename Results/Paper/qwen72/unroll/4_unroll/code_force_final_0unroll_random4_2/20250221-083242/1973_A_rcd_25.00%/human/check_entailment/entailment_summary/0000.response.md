Reasoning:

1. **Odd Sum Check**: 
   - The function correctly checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).

2. **High Score Check**:
   - The function checks if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws. This is correct because if `p3` is at least `p1 + p2`, all points could have been from draws, with `p3` being the sum of all points from draws.

3. **Complex Calculation**:
   - If the above conditions are not met, the function enters a more complex calculation to determine the maximum number of draws. It calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and `p1` or `p2`. It then iterates over possible values of `cur` from `low` to `high` and checks if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is satisfied.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - If the condition is not satisfied for any `cur`, it prints `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as all scores being zero (no games played) and scores where no valid set of games can produce the given scores (e.g., `1 1 1`).

5. **General Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is based on the idea that the total points must be distributed in a way that maximizes the number of draws while ensuring the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

6. **Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary indicates that the function processes the input correctly and follows the logic described. It does not modify the input scores and processes the number of test cases as expected.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and edge cases, and the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is sound.

Correctness: **True**
