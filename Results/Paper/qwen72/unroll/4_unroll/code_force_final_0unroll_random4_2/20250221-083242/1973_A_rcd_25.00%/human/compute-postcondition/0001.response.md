The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` does not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
