You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Example

Input

    5 3
    
    4 1 1 4 4
    
    1 10
    
    7
    
    7 2
    
    4 2 1 100 5 2 3
    
    10 4
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5 2
    
    3 8 1 48 7
    
    6 2
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40
    
    6 3
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40

Output

    2
    1
    1
    3
    5
    1
    6
    
Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `l` of `n` integers. It then calculates the frequency of each unique integer in `l` and checks if the maximum frequency is greater than or equal to `k`. If the condition is met, it prints `k - 1`; otherwise, it prints `n`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the appropriate value (`k - 1` or `n`) has been printed to the output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cards left is flawed. The program checks if the maximum count of any card number is greater than or equal to `k` and then prints `k - 1` if true, otherwise it prints `n`. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of performing multiple operations or the fact that the number of cards left after operations can be less than `k - 1`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
The program will output `2`, which is correct for this case. However, consider another input:
```
1
10 4
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
The program will output `3`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because you can perform the following operations:
1. Exchange 4 cards numbered `1` for 3 cards numbered `1` (remaining: 7 cards).
2. Exchange 4 cards numbered `1` for 3 cards numbered `1` (remaining: 6 cards).
3. Exchange 4 cards numbered `1` for 3 cards numbered `1` (remaining: 5 cards).
4. Exchange 4 cards numbered `1` for 3 cards numbered `1` (remaining: 4 cards).
5. Exchange 4 cards numbered `1` for 3 cards numbered `1` (remaining: 3 cards).
6. Exchange 3 cards numbered `1` for 2 cards numbered `1` (remaining: 2 cards).

Thus, the minimum number of cards left is `2`, not `3`.

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
