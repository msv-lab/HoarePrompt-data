Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers using the specified pouring operation. The key insight here is that if the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, and if at any point during the redistribution, a container has less water than the target amount, it is impossible to achieve the goal because water can only be poured from a container to a container with a higher index, not the other way around.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then extracts the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a` from this list. However, this part of the code is not fully correct for handling multiple test cases, as it assumes the input is a single test case. The correct approach would be to read each test case separately in a loop.

2. **Sum and Divisibility Check**: The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water in all containers and checks if this total is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'No'. This check is redundant because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

3. **Target Calculation**: The target amount of water per container is calculated as `total_water // n`. This is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Redistribution Check**: The function iterates through the list `a` and maintains a running sum `container` that tracks the net amount of water poured into or out of the containers. For each container, it adds the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount to `container`. If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means that more water has been poured out than can be poured in from the previous containers, making it impossible to achieve the target. In this case, the function returns 'No'.

5. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to equalize the water.

However, there is a critical issue with the input handling. The program reads all input at once and processes it as a single test case, which is incorrect for the problem's requirements. The correct approach should involve reading each test case separately and processing them one by one.

Given the correct input handling, the logic of the function `func_1` is sound and should work as intended. Therefore, the core logic of the function is correct, but the input handling is flawed.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed input handling. To fix this, the input should be read and processed for each test case individually. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

# Correct input handling for multiple test cases
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    print(func_1(n, a))
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually, ensuring that the function `func_1` is called correctly for each set of inputs.
