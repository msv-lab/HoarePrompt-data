Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. Here are the reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list. This approach is not suitable for the problem because it does not handle multiple test cases correctly. Each test case should be processed individually.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with `n` and `a` as arguments, but `n` and `a` are not correctly set up for multiple test cases. The program should read the number of test cases and process each test case separately.

3. **Logic Error**: The logic inside `func_1` is incorrect. The program checks if the cumulative difference from the target water level is ever negative, which is not the correct way to determine if the water can be evenly distributed. The correct approach is to check if the water can be transferred from higher containers to lower containers without violating the condition \(i < j\).

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the number of containers and the amounts of water.
3. Check if the water can be evenly distributed by ensuring that the sum of water in the first \(k\) containers is always greater than or equal to \(k \times \text{target}\) for all \(k\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    container_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        container_sum += a[i]
        if container_sum < (i + 1) * target:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list. It then processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the number of containers \(n\) and the amounts of water \(a\).
3. **Checking Feasibility**: It calculates the target amount of water each container should have and checks if the cumulative sum of water in the first \(k\) containers is always greater than or equal to \(k \times \text{target}\). If this condition is violated at any point, it returns 'No'.
4. **Output**: It collects the results for all test cases and prints them.

This corrected program will correctly determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.
