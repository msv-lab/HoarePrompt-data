### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. The first element of this list is the number of test cases `n`, and the rest of the elements are the water amounts in the containers for all test cases.
   - However, the program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It only processes the first test case and ignores the rest. This is a significant issue because the problem description specifies that there can be multiple test cases (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`).

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of containers) and `a` (the list of water amounts in the containers).
   - It calculates the total amount of water in all containers and checks if the total is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'No'. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant.
   - The function then calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and maintains a running sum `container` of the differences between the current water amount and the target.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it returns 'No'. This is because if `container` is negative, it means that the current container has less water than the target, and there is no way to pour water from a container with less water to another container without violating the condition `i < j`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic of the function is correct for determining if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water. The key insight is that if the running sum `container` ever becomes negative, it is impossible to achieve the target because you cannot pour water from a container with less water to another container.
   - If the function completes the loop without `container` becoming negative, it means that it is possible to balance the water amounts, and it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program fails to handle multiple test cases correctly. It should read the number of test cases `t` and then process each test case individually. The current implementation only processes the first test case and ignores the rest.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**False**
