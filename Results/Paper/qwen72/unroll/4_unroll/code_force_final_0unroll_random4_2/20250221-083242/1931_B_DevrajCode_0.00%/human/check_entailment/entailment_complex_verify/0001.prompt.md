You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, and `total_water % n == 0`
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: `container` is 0, `n`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target` remain unchanged.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, where the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. It returns 'No' if it is not possible to redistribute the elements of `a` such that no container (element in `a`) ever has less than the target amount of water (the average sum of elements in `a` divided by `n`), and 'Yes' if such a redistribution is possible. After the function concludes, the variables `n`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target` remain unchanged, and `container` is 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have `n` containers with initial water amounts `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of all water amounts is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Since the sum of all water amounts is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container is `total_water // n`.
   - To achieve the target amount in each container, we need to ensure that the water can be redistributed such that no container ever has less water than the target amount during the redistribution process.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Calculate the total water and the target amount for each container.
   - Iterate through the containers and keep a running sum of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount.
   - If at any point the running sum becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than the target amount, and it cannot be balanced by pouring water from a container with a higher index. Hence, it is impossible to achieve the target amount in all containers.
   - If the running sum remains non-negative throughout the iteration, it is possible to achieve the target amount in all containers.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the input and splits it into a list.
   - It extracts the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a`.
   - It calculates the total water and checks if it is divisible by `n` (which is guaranteed by the problem statement).
   - It calculates the target amount of water for each container.
   - It iterates through the containers, maintaining a running sum of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount.
   - If the running sum becomes negative, it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the running sum becoming negative, it returns 'Yes'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the total water is divisible by `n` (as guaranteed by the problem statement).
   - It correctly checks if the running sum of differences becomes negative, which is a valid condition to determine if the redistribution is impossible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The reasoning and the implementation are sound.
