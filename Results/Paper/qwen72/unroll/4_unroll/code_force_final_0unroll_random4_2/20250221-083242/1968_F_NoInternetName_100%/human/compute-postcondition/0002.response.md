Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `cast` and returns an iterator that applies the `cast` function to each element of a list generated by splitting a user-provided input string by spaces. The final state of the program is that it has an iterator ready to be consumed, which will yield the casted values of the input elements. **
