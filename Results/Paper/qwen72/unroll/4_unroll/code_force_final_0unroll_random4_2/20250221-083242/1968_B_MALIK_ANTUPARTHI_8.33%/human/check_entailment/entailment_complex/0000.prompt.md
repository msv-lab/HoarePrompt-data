Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Output

    2

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = input()
        
        e = input()
        
        k = 0
        
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        
        print(k)
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The loop iterates `a` times, and for each iteration, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are updated based on the input. After each iteration, `k` is printed, and its value is determined by the logic within the inner loop. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, followed by two binary strings `d` and `e` of lengths `b` and `c` respectively. It then processes these strings to find the smallest index `k` such that the substring of `d` up to index `k` can be found in `e`. If the entire string `d` is found in `e`, `k` will be the length of `d`. The function prints the value of `k` for each test case. The function does not return any value, and it does not modify the initial state of `t`, `n`, or `m` as they are not used or modified within the function.
