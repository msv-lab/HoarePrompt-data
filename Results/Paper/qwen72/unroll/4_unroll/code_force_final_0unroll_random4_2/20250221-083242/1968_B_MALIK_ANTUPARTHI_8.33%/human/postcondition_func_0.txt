The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, followed by two binary strings `d` and `e` of lengths `b` and `c` respectively. It then processes these strings to find the smallest index `k` such that the substring of `d` up to index `k` can be found in `e`. If the entire string `d` is found in `e`, `k` will be the length of `d`. The function prints the value of `k` for each test case. The function does not return any value, and it does not modify the initial state of `t`, `n`, or `m` as they are not used or modified within the function.
