Output State: **`n` is a specific integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.** 

The function `func_2` reads a specific integer `n` from the standard input, and `u2vs` is now a list containing `n` empty lists, each corresponding to a vertex in the tree. The initial state information about the input format and the assumption that the input forms a valid tree remains valid.
