The function `func_2` does not take any arguments. It reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree. The following `n - 1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree. The function assumes that the input forms a valid tree.
