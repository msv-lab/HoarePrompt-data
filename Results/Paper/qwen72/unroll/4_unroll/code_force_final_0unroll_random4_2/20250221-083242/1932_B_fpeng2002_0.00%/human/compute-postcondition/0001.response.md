The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num_tests` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

State: **`func` should accept two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and a list of lists `cases` where each sublist contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. `num_tests` must be greater than 0.**
