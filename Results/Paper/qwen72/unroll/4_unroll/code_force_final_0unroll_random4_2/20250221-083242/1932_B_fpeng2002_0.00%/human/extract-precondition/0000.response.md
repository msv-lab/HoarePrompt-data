Precondition: **The function `func` should accept two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and a list of lists `cases` where each sublist contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.**

However, the provided function definition `def func():` does not match the problem description. It should be updated to accept the appropriate parameters. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, cases):
```

With the corrected function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and cases is a list of lists where each sublist contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.**
