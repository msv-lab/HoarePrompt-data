Output State: **The function `func` should accept two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and a list of lists `cases` where each sublist contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. `num_tests` is an input integer.**
