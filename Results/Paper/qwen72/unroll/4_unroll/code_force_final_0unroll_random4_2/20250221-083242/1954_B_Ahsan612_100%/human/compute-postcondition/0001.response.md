Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it processes the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number. If the array is uniform (i.e., all elements are the same) or if no such segment is found, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of these segments. The variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.**
