The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, indicating the number of test cases to handle. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
