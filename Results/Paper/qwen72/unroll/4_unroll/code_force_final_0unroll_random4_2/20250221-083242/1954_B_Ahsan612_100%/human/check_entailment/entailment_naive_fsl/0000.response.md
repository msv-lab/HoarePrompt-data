Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has alternating elements that are not the same. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The expected output is `1`, as removing any one of the middle elements will make the array non-beautiful. However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` for this case, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. The program updates `num` and increments `i` in a way that it skips over elements, which can lead to incorrect results.

A correct approach would need to consider the entire array and determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The current logic does not handle this correctly and can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.
