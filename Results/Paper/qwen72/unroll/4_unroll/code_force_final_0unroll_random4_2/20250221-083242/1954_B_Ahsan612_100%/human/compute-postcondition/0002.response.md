The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` representing the length of an array, and an array `a` of integers. The constraints are as follows: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element `a_i` in the array `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

However, the provided function signature does not include any parameters. Assuming the function should accept these parameters, the correct signature would be:

```
def func(t, n, a):
```

Given this, the function `func` accepts three parameters:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer representing the length of the array for each test case.
- `a`: an array of integers for each test case.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters. Since the output details are not specified, I will assume the function returns a list of results, one for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of the array for each test case), and `a` (array of integers for each test case). It processes each test case and returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
