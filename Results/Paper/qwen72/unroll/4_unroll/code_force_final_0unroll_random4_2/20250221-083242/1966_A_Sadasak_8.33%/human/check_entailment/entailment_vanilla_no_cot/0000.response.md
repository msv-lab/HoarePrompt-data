Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Frequency Capping**:
   - The function `func_1` caps the frequency of each number to `k`. However, this is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The frequency of each number should be counted without capping it to `k`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards Calculation**:
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if it is. This is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards left.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the total number of cards that can be exchanged and then determining the minimum number of cards left.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each number, calculate how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed.
   - The remaining cards after forming these sets will be the number of cards that cannot be exchanged.
   - The minimum number of cards left is the sum of the remainders when the frequency of each number is divided by `k`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = {}
        for num in nums:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        min_cards_left = sum(f % k for f in freq.values())
        print(max(1, min_cards_left))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Frequency Calculation**: The frequency of each number is counted without capping.
- **Minimum Cards Left**: The sum of the remainders when each frequency is divided by `k` gives the number of cards that cannot be exchanged. The `max(1, min_cards_left)` ensures that the minimum number of cards left is at least 1, as you cannot have 0 cards left.

This corrected program should correctly determine the minimum number of cards left for each test case.
