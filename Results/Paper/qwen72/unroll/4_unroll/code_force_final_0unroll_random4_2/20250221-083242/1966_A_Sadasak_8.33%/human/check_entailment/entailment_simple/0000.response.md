Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of cards one can have left in their hand after performing a series of operations, where in each operation, `k` cards with the same number are exchanged for `k-1` cards of any chosen number.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cards) and `k` (the number of cards to exchange).
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `k > n`, it means there are not enough cards to perform any exchange, so the number of cards remains `n`.
   - If `k == n`, it means all cards can be exchanged in one operation, leaving `k-1` cards.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in `nums`, but caps the frequency at `k`. This is because any frequency greater than `k` can be reduced to `k` by performing the exchange operation multiple times.

4. **Final Output:**
   - If any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`, it means that one full exchange can be performed, leaving `k-1` cards.
   - Otherwise, the program outputs `n`, which is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of performing multiple exchanges to reduce the number of cards.

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple exchanges can be performed to reduce the number of cards. For example, if `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` and `k = 4`, the program should output `3` (since you can perform two exchanges of 4 cards each, leaving 3 cards), but it outputs `10` because it doesn't account for the possibility of multiple exchanges.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach would involve calculating the total number of cards that can be exchanged and then determining the minimum number of cards left. This can be done by summing the frequencies of all card numbers, performing as many full exchanges as possible, and then calculating the remainder.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the possibility of multiple exchanges correctly.

Correctness: **False**
