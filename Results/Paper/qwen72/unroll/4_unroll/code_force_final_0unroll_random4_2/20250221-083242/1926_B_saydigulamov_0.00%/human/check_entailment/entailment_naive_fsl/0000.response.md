Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape drawn on the grid is a triangle or a square. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
2
3
000
011
011
4
0000
0000
0100
1110
```

**Expected Output:**
```
SQUARE
TRIANGLE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
[2, 2]
[1, 3]
```

The program prints the list `k` instead of the required output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE". Additionally, the logic for determining the shape is incorrect. The program checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, but this is not sufficient to determine the shape. For example, in the second test case, the first two rows have 0 '1's, which does not help in determining the shape. The program needs to check the entire grid to determine if the shape is a triangle or a square.
