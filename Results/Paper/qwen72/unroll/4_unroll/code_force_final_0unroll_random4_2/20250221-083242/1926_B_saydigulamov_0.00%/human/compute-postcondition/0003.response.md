The function `func` accepts no parameters. It internally handles multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of a grid, followed by `n` lines of `n` characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, and the shape's size is greater than 1. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).

For each test case, the function returns a string indicating whether the shape formed by the '1's is a "triangle" or a "square".

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each with a grid of '0's and '1's, and returns "triangle" or "square" based on the shape formed by the '1's in the grid.**
