Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases, `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid, `n`, and then reads `n` lines of the grid.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function collects the count of '1's in each row where '1' is present into a list `k`.
   - The condition `if k[0] == k[1]` is used to determine if the shape is a square. This condition checks if the first and second rows have the same number of '1's.

3. **Output**:
   - If the first and second rows have the same number of '1's, the function prints the list `k`.

**Issues**:
- The function does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement.
- The function only checks the first two rows to determine the shape, which is insufficient. For a square, all rows should have the same number of '1's, and for a triangle, the number of '1's should form a specific pattern (1, 3, 5, ... or 5, 3, 1, ...).

**Correct Implementation**:
- The function should check if all rows have the same number of '1's to determine if the shape is a square.
- For a triangle, the function should check if the number of '1's in each row forms a sequence of odd numbers (either increasing or decreasing).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Collect the count of '1's in each row
        k = [row.count('1') for row in grid if '1' in row]
        
        # Check if the shape is a square
        if len(set(k)) == 1:
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            # Check if the shape is a triangle
            is_triangle = True
            for i in range(len(k) - 1):
                if abs(k[i] - k[i + 1]) != 2:
                    is_triangle = False
                    break
            if is_triangle:
                print("TRIANGLE")
            else:
                print("TRIANGLE")  # This should be "TRIANGLE" if not a square

```

**Explanation**:
- **Square Check**: The `set(k)` will contain only one unique value if all rows have the same number of '1's, indicating a square.
- **Triangle Check**: The function checks if the difference between the count of '1's in consecutive rows is exactly 2, which is the pattern for a triangle (either increasing or decreasing).

**Conclusion**:
The given program is incorrect because it does not print the required output and does not correctly identify the shape based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
