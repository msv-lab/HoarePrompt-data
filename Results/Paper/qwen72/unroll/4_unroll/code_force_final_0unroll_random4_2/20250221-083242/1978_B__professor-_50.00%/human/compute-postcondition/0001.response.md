The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input integer `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used outside the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
