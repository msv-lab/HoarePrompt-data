The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `p`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, representing the number of elements in the list `p`. `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, `p_i` â‰  i, and all `p_i` are distinct. The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `p`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers, none of which are equal to their index. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
