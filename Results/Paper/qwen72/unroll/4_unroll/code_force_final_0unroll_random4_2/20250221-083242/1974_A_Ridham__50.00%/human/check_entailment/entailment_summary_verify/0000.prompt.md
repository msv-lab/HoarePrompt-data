You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user, where `x` is the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 x 2 icon. It calculates the total number of screens required to fit all the icons, considering that each screen can hold up to 15 cells (1 x 1 icons) and 2 x 2 icons take up 4 cells each. The function then prints the number of screens required for each test case, one per line. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons (x) is less than the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons, but still requires an additional screen due to the layout constraints of the 5x3 grid. Specifically, the program calculates the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons and then checks if the 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space. However, it does not account for the fact that the remaining space might be fragmented in such a way that not all 1x1 icons can fit, even if the total number of remaining cells is sufficient.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
14 1
```
The program will calculate:
- `screen_require_for_y = 1` (since 1 2x2 icon requires 1 screen)
- `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11` (11 cells remain after placing the 2x2 icon)
- `space_x = 14` (14 1x1 icons)

Since `space_x <= remaining_cells` is `14 <= 11`, the program will incorrectly determine that only 1 screen is needed. However, the 14 1x1 icons cannot all fit into the remaining 11 cells because the 2x2 icon will occupy a 2x2 block, leaving the remaining cells in a fragmented layout that cannot accommodate all 14 1x1 icons in a single screen. Therefore, the correct answer should be 2 screens, but the program outputs 1.
