To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `result` is a list containing the calculated number of screens required for each iteration.
- The length of the `result` list is `n`.
- Each element in the `result` list is an integer representing the total number of screens required for the corresponding `x` and `y` values.
- The values of `x` and `y` are updated for each iteration but are not retained after the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`result` List**: The `result` list contains `n` elements, where each element is an integer representing the number of screens required for a specific iteration. The exact values of these integers are not provided, but we know they are calculated based on the input values of `x` and `y` for each iteration.

2. **`map(str, result)`**: This function applies the `str` function to each element in the `result` list, converting each integer to a string. The result is an iterator that yields the string representations of the elements in `result`.

3. **`'\n'.join(map(str, result))`**: This function joins the string representations of the elements in `result` with a newline character (`\n`). The result is a single string where each element of `result` is on a new line.

4. **`print` Statement**: The `print` statement outputs the string created by `'\n'.join(map(str, result))`. This means that each element of `result` will be printed on a new line.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print each element of the `result` list on a new line. Each element is an integer representing the number of screens required for the corresponding iteration, but the exact values of these integers are not provided in the initial state.

Output: **[result[0]]
[result[1]]
...
[result[n-1]] (where each [result[i]] is an integer representing the number of screens required for the corresponding iteration)**
