Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user, where `x` is the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 x 2 icon. It calculates the total number of screens required to fit all the icons, considering that each screen can hold up to 15 cells (1 x 1 icons) and 2 x 2 icons take up 4 cells each. The function then prints the number of screens required for each test case, one per line. The function does not return any value. **
