### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then iterates over each constraint.

2. **Constraint Processing:**
   - The function uses `bx` to track the maximum value of `k` from type 1 constraints (i.e., `k >= x`).
   - The function uses `ax` to track the minimum value of `k` from type 2 constraints (i.e., `k <= x`).
   - The function uses a set `cx` to store the values of `k` that must be avoided from type 3 constraints (i.e., `k != x`).

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - After processing all constraints, the function checks if `bx` (the maximum of type 1 constraints) is greater than `ax` (the minimum of type 2 constraints). If this is true, it means there is no valid `k` that can satisfy both conditions, and the function appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the function calculates the number of valid integers `k` in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of values in `cx` that fall within this range.

4. **Output:**
   - The function correctly prints each element of the result list `r` on a new line, which corresponds to the number of valid integers `k` for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the input and processes the constraints.
- The logic for determining the valid range for `k` and counting the valid integers is correct.
- The function correctly handles the case where no valid `k` exists (i.e., `bx > ax`).

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
