### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cx` is a set used to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (1000000000 + 7) to represent the upper bound of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to represent the lower bound of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the program reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx` to ensure `bx` is the highest lower bound.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax` to ensure `ax` is the lowest upper bound.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Bounds**:
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds simultaneously. In this case, the program appends 0 to the result list `r`.

5. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the program calculates the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, which is `ax - bx + 1`.
   - It then subtracts the number of values in `cx` that fall within this range to get the final count of valid integers `k`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. It ensures that the bounds are respected and accounts for the values that must be avoided. The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
