### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Constraints Processing:**
   - The program initializes `ax` to a very large number (`1000000000.0 + 7`) and `bx` to a very small number (`-1`). These variables are used to track the minimum upper bound and the maximum lower bound, respectively.
   - It also initializes a set `cx` to store the values that `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Constraint Types:**
   - For each constraint, the program reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If the constraint type is 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
   - If the constraint type is 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
   - If the constraint type is 3 (k must not be equal to x), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Validation of Bounds:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends 0 to the result list `r` because no integer can satisfy the constraints.
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of integers in `cx` that fall within this range.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, one per line.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization:**
  - `ax` is initialized to a large number to ensure that any valid upper bound will be smaller.
  - `bx` is initialized to a small number to ensure that any valid lower bound will be larger.
  - `cx` is a set to store the values that `k` must not be equal to, ensuring no duplicates.

- **Processing Constraints:**
  - For type 1 constraints, `bx` is updated to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`, ensuring that `k` is at least as large as the largest lower bound.
  - For type 2 constraints, `ax` is updated to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`, ensuring that `k` is at most as large as the smallest upper bound.
  - For type 3 constraints, `x` is added to the set `cx`, ensuring that `k` cannot be any of these values.

- **Range Calculation:**
  - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means there is no valid range for `k`, so the result is 0.
  - Otherwise, the range `[bx, ax]` is valid, and the program calculates the number of integers in this range (`ax - bx + 1`).
  - It then subtracts the number of values in `cx` that fall within this range to get the final count of valid integers.

### Potential Issues:

- **Floating Point Initialization:**
  - The initialization of `ax` to `1000000000.0 + 7` is unnecessary and can be simplified to `1000000007` (an integer). This does not affect the correctness but is a minor improvement for clarity.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where `bx` is greater than `ax`, returning 0.
  - The program correctly handles the case where there are no type 3 constraints within the valid range, returning the full range count.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem description. The minor issue with the floating point initialization does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
