Output State: **`r` is a list containing the number of valid integers `k` for each test case, where `k` satisfies all the given constraints. Each element in `r` corresponds to a test case and represents the count of integers `k` that meet the conditions: `k` is greater than or equal to the maximum of all type 1 constraints, less than or equal to the minimum of all type 2 constraints, and not equal to any of the type 3 constraints within the range. If no valid `k` exists for a test case, the corresponding element in `r` is 0.**
