For the loop to execute, the only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `ii`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. To ensure the loop can execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `ii` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
