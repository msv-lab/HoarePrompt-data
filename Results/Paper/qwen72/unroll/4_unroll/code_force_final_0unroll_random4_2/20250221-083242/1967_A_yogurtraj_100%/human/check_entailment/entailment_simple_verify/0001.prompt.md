You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the final value calculated based on the conditions in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are updated for each test case, but their values are reset at the start of each new test case. After all iterations, the final state of `t` is 0, and the values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are undefined for the next test case (if any). The loop does not modify any variables outside of its scope.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given `n` types of cards, each with a count `a_i`.
   - We can buy up to `k` additional cards.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A subarray of length `n` is a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]` if and only if it contains exactly one of each card type.
   - To maximize the score, we need to ensure that the counts of each card type are as balanced as possible.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program sorts the counts of the cards `a` in ascending order.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list to find the point where we can no longer balance the counts using the remaining `k` coins.
   - For each card type `i`, it calculates the difference between the current count `a[i]` and the next count `a[i+1]` and checks if we can balance the counts using the remaining `k` coins.
   - If we can balance the counts, we update `k` and `r` (the current minimum count).
   - If we cannot balance the counts, we stop and calculate the final score.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `r` is initialized to the smallest count `a[0]`.
     - `rem` is used to store the remainder of the coins after the last balancing.
     - `y` is used to store the number of card types that are not balanced.
   - **Balancing Loop:**
     - For each card type `i` from 0 to `n-2`:
       - Calculate the number of coins needed to balance the counts up to `a[i+1]`.
       - If the required coins exceed `k`, update `r` to the maximum possible balanced count, calculate the remainder `rem`, and break the loop.
       - Otherwise, update `k` and `r` to the next balanced count.
   - **Final Calculation:**
     - If `k` is not zero after the loop, it means we can still balance the counts further.
     - Calculate the final score using the balanced count `r` and the remaining coins.
     - If `k` is zero, use the balanced count `r`, the remainder `rem`, and the number of unbalanced card types `y` to calculate the final score.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly balances the counts of the card types.
   - It handles the case where `k` is not enough to balance all counts.
   - The final score calculation is correct and matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
