Output State: **`introverts` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `introverts` <= 10^9, `extroverts` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `extroverts` <= 10^9, `universals` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `universals` <= 10^9, `ret` is the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**. 

The values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remain unchanged, but `ret` now holds the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments.
