### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to accommodate `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals in tents.
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.
   - We need to find the minimum number of tents required, or output -1 if it's impossible to meet all preferences.

2. **Analyzing Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function is responsible for calculating the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - The function checks if the number of extroverts is divisible by 3. If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is at least 3. If it is, the function returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3.
   - If the remaining extroverts plus universals is less than 3, it means there are not enough people to form a complete tent for the remaining extroverts, and the function returns `None`.

3. **Analyzing Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function combines the results of `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` and returns the total number of tents.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert needs a separate tent. This is correctly handled by adding `introverts` to the result.
   - **Extroverts and Universals:**
     - If the number of extroverts is divisible by 3, all extroverts can be accommodated in complete tents.
     - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, the remaining extroverts (1 or 2) need to be combined with universals to form a complete tent. If there are not enough universals to form a complete tent, the function returns `None` (impossible).
     - The function then calculates the total number of tents needed for extroverts and universals using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Introverts:** If there are only introverts, the number of tents is simply the number of introverts.
   - **All Extroverts:** If there are only extroverts, the number of tents is `ceil(extroverts / 3)`.
   - **All Universals:** If there are only universals, the number of tents is `ceil(universals / 3)`.
   - **Mixed Cases:** The function handles mixed cases correctly by ensuring that extroverts are always in complete tents and universals are used to fill any remaining spots.

6. **Example Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - Input: `1 2 3`
     - Output: `3`
     - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals.
   - **Test Case 2:**
     - Input: `1 4 1`
     - Output: `-1`
     - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 extrovert left who cannot form a complete tent with the 1 universal.
   - **Test Case 3:**
     - Input: `1 4 2`
     - Output: `3`
     - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 1 extrovert and 1 universal.
   - **Test Case 4:**
     - Input: `1 1 1`
     - Output: `-1`
     - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 extrovert left who cannot form a complete tent with the 1 universal.
   - **Test Case 5:**
     - Input: `1 3 2`
     - Output: `3`
     - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the 2 universals.
   - **Test Case 6:**
     - Input: `19 7 18`
     - Output: `28`
     - Explanation: 19 tents for introverts, 2 tents for 6 extroverts and 3 universals, and 1 tent for the remaining 1 extrovert and 2 universals. Total: 28 tents.
   - **Test Case 7:**
     - Input: `0 0 0`
     - Output: `0`
     - Explanation: No participants, so no tents needed.
   - **Test Case 8:**
     - Input: `7 0 0`
     - Output: `7`
     - Explanation: 7 introverts, so 7 tents needed.
   - **Test Case 9:**
     - Input: `0 24 0`
     - Output: `8`
     - Explanation: 24 extroverts, so 8 tents needed (24 / 3 = 8).
   - **Test Case 10:**
     - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
     - Output: `1666666667`
     - Explanation: 1000000000 introverts, 333333333 tents for 1000000000 extroverts, and 333333334 tents for 1000000000 universals. Total: 1666666667 tents.
