### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate introverts, extroverts, and universals according to their preferences.
   - Introverts must be alone in a tent.
   - Extroverts must be in a tent with two others.
   - Universals can be in any tent configuration.

2. **Breaking Down the Solution:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert requires a separate tent. Therefore, the number of tents needed for introverts is simply `a`.
   - **Extroverts and Universals:** Extroverts need to be in a tent with two others. This means we need to find a way to pair extroverts with either other extroverts or universals to form groups of three.

3. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]` is designed to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it means there are some extroverts left over after forming complete groups of three. These leftover extroverts need to be paired with universals.
   - If the number of leftover extroverts plus the number of universals is less than 3, it is impossible to form a valid group, and the function returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, the function returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

4. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int` combines the results from `func_1` and the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents for introverts and the number of tents for extroverts and universals.

5. **Checking the Example Cases:**
   - **Case 1: (1, 2, 3)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts and Universals: 2 extroverts + 1 universal = 3 people (1 tent), 2 universals = 1 tent (since they can be alone or with one other)
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents
   - **Case 2: (1, 4, 1)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts and Universals: 4 extroverts + 1 universal = 5 people
     - 4 extroverts form 1 tent, 1 extrovert and 1 universal cannot form a valid group (impossible)
     - Total: -1
   - **Case 3: (1, 4, 2)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts and Universals: 4 extroverts + 2 universals = 6 people
     - 4 extroverts form 1 tent, 2 universals form 1 tent
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents
   - **Case 4: (1, 1, 1)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts and Universals: 1 extrovert + 1 universal = 2 people (impossible to form a valid group)
     - Total: -1
   - **Case 5: (1, 3, 2)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts and Universals: 3 extroverts + 2 universals = 5 people
     - 3 extroverts form 1 tent, 2 universals form 1 tent
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents
   - **Case 6: (19, 7, 18)**
     - Introverts: 19 tents
     - Extroverts and Universals: 7 extroverts + 18 universals = 25 people
     - 7 extroverts form 3 tents (21 people), 4 universals form 1 tent
     - Total: 19 (introverts) + 9 (extroverts and universals) = 28 tents
   - **Case 7: (0, 0, 0)**
     - Introverts: 0 tents
     - Extroverts and Universals: 0 people
     - Total: 0 tents
   - **Case 8: (7, 0, 0)**
     - Introverts: 7 tents
     - Extroverts and Universals: 0 people
     - Total: 7 tents
   - **Case 9: (0, 24, 0)**
     - Introverts: 0 tents
     - Extroverts and Universals: 24 extroverts = 8 tents
     - Total: 8 tents
   - **Case 10: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
     - Introverts: 1000000000 tents
     - Extroverts and Universals: 1000000000 extroverts + 1000000000 universals = 2000000000 people
     - 1000000000 extroverts form 333333334 tents, 1000000000 universals form 333333334 tents
     - Total: 1000000000 (introverts) + 666666667 (extroverts and universals) = 1666666667 tents
