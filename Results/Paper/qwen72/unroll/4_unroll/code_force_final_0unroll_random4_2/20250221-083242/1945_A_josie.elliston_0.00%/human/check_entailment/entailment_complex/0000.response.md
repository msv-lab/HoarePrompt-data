Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is responsible for determining the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, it checks if the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is at least 3. This is because if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, there will be a remainder of 1 or 2 extroverts that need to be paired with universals to form a complete tent of 3 people.
   - If the sum is less than 3, it returns `None` indicating that it is impossible to form the required tents.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3, which is the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all extroverts and universals.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is responsible for determining the total number of tents required for all participants.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`, which gives the total number of tents needed.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases are:
     - `1 2 3`: 1 introvert, 2 extroverts, 3 universals. The extroverts need 1 tent, and the remaining 2 universals can form another tent. Total: 3 tents.
     - `1 4 1`: 1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal. 4 extroverts need 2 tents, but there is only 1 universal left, which is not enough to form a complete tent. Output: -1.
     - `1 4 2`: 1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 2 universals. 4 extroverts need 2 tents, and the remaining 2 universals can form another tent. Total: 3 tents.
     - `1 1 1`: 1 introvert, 1 extrovert, 1 universal. 1 extrovert cannot form a tent with only 1 universal. Output: -1.
     - `1 3 2`: 1 introvert, 3 extroverts, 2 universals. 3 extroverts need 1 tent, and the remaining 2 universals can form another tent. Total: 3 tents.
     - `19 7 18`: 19 introverts, 7 extroverts, 18 universals. 7 extroverts need 3 tents, and the remaining 18 universals can form 6 tents. Total: 28 tents.
     - `0 0 0`: No participants, so no tents are needed. Total: 0 tents.
     - `7 0 0`: 7 introverts, no extroverts or universals. Each introvert needs a separate tent. Total: 7 tents.
     - `0 24 0`: No introverts or universals, 24 extroverts. 24 extroverts need 8 tents. Total: 8 tents.
     - `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`: 1 billion introverts, 1 billion extroverts, 1 billion universals. 1 billion extroverts need 333333334 tents, and the remaining 1 billion universals can form 333333334 tents. Total: 1666666667 tents.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where there are no participants (`0 0 0`).
   - It correctly handles cases where it is impossible to form the required tents (`1 1 1`).
   - It correctly handles cases with large numbers of participants (`1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all the requirements and edge cases as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
