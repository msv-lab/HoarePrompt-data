### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip()`, which is efficient for large inputs.
   - The helper functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are correctly implemented to parse the input. `func_1` reads a line and strips the newline character, `func_2` converts the line to an integer, and `func_3` splits the line into a list of integers. These functions are used appropriately to handle different types of input lines.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_4` initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program iterates over each throw and updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after each throw.
   - For each throw, it checks the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - This logic is correct because it accounts for both possible directions when `c` is '?'.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` if it is. This is necessary because player `n` is represented as `0` in the modulo operation, and the output should be in the range `[1, n]`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and then prints the players' numbers in increasing order. This is done using `print(len(ans))` and `print(*ans)`, which is correct.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Modulo Operation for Counterclockwise Throws:**
   - The program uses `(q - r) % n` to handle counterclockwise throws. However, this can result in negative values, which are not correctly handled by the modulo operation in Python. For example, if `q = 1` and `r = 2`, `(1 - 2) % 5` would result in `4` instead of `0` (which should be `5` in the context of the problem). To fix this, the correct way to handle counterclockwise throws is to use `(q - r + n) % n`.

2. **Set Operations:**
   - The program correctly uses sets to keep track of all possible positions of the ball, ensuring that duplicates are not added and that the final set contains unique player numbers.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the size of the set `ans` and all elements in the set in increasing order.

### Corrected Code:

```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

# Function 1:
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

# Function 3:
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

# Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r + n) % n)  # Corrected counterclockwise throw
        ans = temp
    if 0 in ans:
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))  # Ensure the output is sorted

# Main loop to handle multiple test cases
t = func_2()
for _ in range(t):
    func_4()
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was mostly accurate, but it overlooked a critical issue with the modulo operation for counterclockwise throws. The corrected code ensures that the counterclockwise throws are handled correctly by using `(q - r + n) % n`. This change is necessary to ensure the program's correctness.

Final: **False** (The original program had a bug in handling counterclockwise throws, which has been corrected.)
