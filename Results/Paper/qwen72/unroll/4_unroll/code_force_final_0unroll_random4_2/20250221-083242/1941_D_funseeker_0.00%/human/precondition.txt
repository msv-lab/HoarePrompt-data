The function `read` is intended to read input data for the game described. The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with three integers n, m, x, where n represents the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m represents the number of throws (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and x represents the player who starts with the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n). This is followed by m lines, each containing an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?'), indicating the distance of the throw and the direction (clockwise, counterclockwise, or unknown, respectively). The total number of test cases t is given such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
