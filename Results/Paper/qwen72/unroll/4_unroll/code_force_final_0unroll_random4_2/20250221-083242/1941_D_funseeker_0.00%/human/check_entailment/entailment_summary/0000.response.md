### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This is a standard way to read input from stdin in Python.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer. This correctly sets up the number of test cases.
   - `func_3` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. This is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4`:**
   - The function `func_4` initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - It then iterates `m` times, each time reading a throw distance `r` and a direction `c` from the input.
   - For each throw, it calculates the possible new positions of the ball:
     - If the direction is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If the direction is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates the set `ans` with the values in `temp`.
   - If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to account for the 0-based indexing used in the modulo operation.
   - Finally, it prints the size of the set `ans` and the elements of the set in increasing order.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where `0` is in the set `ans` by converting it to `n`.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown (`?`), by considering both possible directions.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and the list of those players in increasing order, which matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, given the constraints and the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
