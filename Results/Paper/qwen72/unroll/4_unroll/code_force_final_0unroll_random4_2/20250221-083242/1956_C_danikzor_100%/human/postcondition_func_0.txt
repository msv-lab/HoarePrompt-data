The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, prints a tuple containing two values: the first value is the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the second value is `2 * n`. It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n`, printing two lines for each iteration: the first line starts with `1` followed by the current loop index `i` and a sequence of integers from `n` to 1; the second line starts with `2` followed by the current loop index `i` and the same sequence of integers from `n` to 1. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `n` remains unchanged.
