Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the matrix using no more than 2n operations. However, the program always outputs a fixed number of operations (2n) and uses the same permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` for both types of operations, which is not optimal.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum as `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, which is not the correct formula for the maximum sum. The correct maximum sum for an n√ón matrix filled with permutations of integers from 1 to n is `n * (n + 1) * n // 2`.

2. **Suboptimal Operations:**
   - The program uses the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` for both row and column operations. This permutation does not maximize the sum of the matrix. Instead, using the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` would be more appropriate.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the sum of the matrix, you should use the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` for both row and column operations. This way, each element in the matrix will be a distinct integer from 1 to n, and the sum will be maximized.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    max_sum = n * (n + 1) * n // 2
    print(max_sum, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
        print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum is calculated as `n * (n + 1) * n // 2`, which is the sum of all integers from 1 to n, repeated n times (once for each row and column).

2. **Operations:**
   - For each row and column, the program uses the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to fill the matrix. This ensures that each element in the matrix is a distinct integer from 1 to n, and the sum is maximized.

This corrected program will correctly solve the problem as described.
