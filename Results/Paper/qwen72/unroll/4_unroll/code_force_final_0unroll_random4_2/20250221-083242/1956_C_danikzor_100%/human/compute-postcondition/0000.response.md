The value of `n` is assigned the result of converting the user input to an integer. The function `func_1` still lacks parameters, and no other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving a matrix and operations, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case. `n` is an input integer.**
