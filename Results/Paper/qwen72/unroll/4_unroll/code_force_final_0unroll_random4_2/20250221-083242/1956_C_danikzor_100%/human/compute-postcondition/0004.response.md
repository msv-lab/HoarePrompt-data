The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving a matrix and operations, but the provided function definition does not include any parameters. Based on the description, the correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case. However, since the function definition is missing these parameters, it is unclear what the function returns or how it processes the inputs. To accurately describe the functionality, we need to assume the correct parameters are included.

Assuming the correct function definition is:
```
def func_1(t, n):
```

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer representing the size of the matrix for each test case.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but typically, such a function would return some result based on the operations performed on the matrix for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and `n` (an integer representing the size of the matrix for each test case). The function's return value is not specified, but it is intended to process the matrix operations for each test case.**
