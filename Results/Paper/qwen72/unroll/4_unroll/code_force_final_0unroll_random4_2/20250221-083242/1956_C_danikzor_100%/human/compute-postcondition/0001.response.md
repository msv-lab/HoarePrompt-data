Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving a matrix and operations, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters.
- The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case.
- `n` is an input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Expression 1: `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`**
   - This expression calculates a value based on the input integer `n`.
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is a mathematical formula that computes a specific value. It is often used in combinatorics or number theory, but without additional context, we can only describe it based on the formula itself.
   - The `//` operator performs integer division, which means the result will be an integer.

2. **Expression 2: `2 * n`**
   - This expression simply multiplies the input integer `n` by 2.
   - The result will be an integer.

### Output:
- The `print` statement will output two values separated by a comma.
- The first value is the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
- The second value is the result of the expression `2 * n`.

Since `n` is an input integer, we can't determine its exact value without knowing the specific input. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the input integer)**
