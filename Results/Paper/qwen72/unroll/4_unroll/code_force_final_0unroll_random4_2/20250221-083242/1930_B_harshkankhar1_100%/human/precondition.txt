The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation p. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
