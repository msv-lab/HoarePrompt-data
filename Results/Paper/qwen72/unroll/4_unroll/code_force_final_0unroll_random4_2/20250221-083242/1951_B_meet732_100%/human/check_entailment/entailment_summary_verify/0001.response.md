### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a single-elimination tournament where cows are paired based on their initial positions.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of matches won by our cow `k` by potentially swapping its position once.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of our cow `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ratings `l`.
   - The function `func_1` is called to determine the maximum number of wins for our cow.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of ratings `a` and the index `k` of our cow.
   - It initializes `x` with the rating of our cow.
   - It creates a list `ind` to store the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - It iterates through the list `a` to find the first two cows with ratings higher than `x` and stores their indices in `ind`.

4. **Cases Considered:**
   - **Case 1: No cows have a higher rating than `x` (`ind` is empty):**
     - Our cow can win all `n-1` matches.
     - The function returns `n - 1`.
   - **Case 2: Only one cow has a higher rating than `x` (`len(ind) == 1`):**
     - If this cow is at position 0, our cow can win `k-1` matches.
     - If this cow is after our cow, our cow can win `ind[0] - 1` matches.
     - If this cow is before our cow, our cow can win the maximum of `k - ind[0]` or `ind[0] - 1` matches.
   - **Case 3: Two cows have higher ratings than `x` (`len(ind) == 2`):**
     - If the first cow with a higher rating is at position 0, our cow can win the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` or `k - 1` matches.
     - If our cow is after the second cow with a higher rating, our cow can win the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` or `ind[1] - ind[0]` matches.
     - Otherwise, our cow can win the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` or `k - ind[0]` matches.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where our cow is the highest-rated cow.
   - It also handles the case where our cow is the lowest-rated cow.
   - The logic for determining the optimal number of wins is based on the positions of the two highest-rated cows, which is consistent with the problem description.

6. **Optimality:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the optimal position for our cow to maximize wins by considering the positions of the two highest-rated cows.
   - The logic for each case is sound and matches the problem requirements.

### Detailed Analysis and Verification:

- **Case 1: No cows have a higher rating than `x` (`ind` is empty):**
  - This is correctly handled by returning `n - 1`, as our cow will win all matches.

- **Case 2: Only one cow has a higher rating than `x` (`len(ind) == 1`):**
  - If the cow with a higher rating is at position 0, our cow can win `k - 1` matches.
  - If the cow with a higher rating is after our cow, our cow can win `ind[0] - 1` matches.
  - If the cow with a higher rating is before our cow, our cow can win the maximum of `k - ind[0]` or `ind[0] - 1` matches.
  - These conditions are correctly implemented and match the problem requirements.

- **Case 3: Two cows have higher ratings than `x` (`len(ind) == 2`):**
  - If the first cow with a higher rating is at position 0, our cow can win the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` or `k - 1` matches.
  - If our cow is after the second cow with a higher rating, our cow can win the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` or `ind[1] - ind[0]` matches.
  - Otherwise, our cow can win the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` or `k - ind[0]` matches.
  - These conditions are also correctly implemented and match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the maximum number of wins our cow can achieve. The cases considered and the logic used are consistent with the problem description.

Final: **True**
