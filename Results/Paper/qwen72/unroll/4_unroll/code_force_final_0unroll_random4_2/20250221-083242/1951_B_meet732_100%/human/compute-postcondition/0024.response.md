The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of `n` cows. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1:** If there are no elements in `a` greater than the Cowdeforces rating of the k-th cow (`x`), the function returns `n - 1`.
- **Case_2:** If the k-th cow has the highest rating in the list, the function returns `k - 1`.
- **Case_3:** If the first element in `a` with a rating greater than `x` is after the k-th cow, the function returns the index of this first element minus 1.
- **Case_4:** If the first element in `a` with a rating greater than `x` is before or at the k-th cow, the function returns the maximum value between the distance from `k` to this element and the distance from this element to the start of the list.
- **Case_5:** If there are exactly two elements in `a` with ratings greater than `x`, the function returns the smaller of the two values: the distance from the second element to the start of the list or the distance from the k-th element to the start of the list.
- **Case_6:** If there are exactly two elements in `a` with ratings greater than `x` and the first element is not at the start of the list, the function returns the larger of the two values: the distance from the first element to the start of the list or the distance between the first and second elements.
- **Case_7:** If there is exactly one element in `a` with a rating greater than `x`, the function returns the larger of the two values: the distance from this element to the start of the list or the distance from the k-th element to this element.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of `n` cows. It returns different values based on the position of the k-th cow's rating (`x`) relative to other ratings in the list.**
