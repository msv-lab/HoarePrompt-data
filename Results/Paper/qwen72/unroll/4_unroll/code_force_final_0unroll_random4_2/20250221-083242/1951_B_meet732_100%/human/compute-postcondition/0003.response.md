The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`a` is a list of n integers where n is the number of cows, and each integer a_i represents the Cowdeforces rating of cow i, with all a_i being distinct. `x` is equal to `a[k]`, where `a[k]` is the Cowdeforces rating of the k-th cow. `ind` is an empty list. `c` is 0. `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
