### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of your cow `k`, and then reads the list of ratings `a`.
   - It adjusts `k` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1 from it.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.
   - It initializes `x` to be the rating of your cow, `ind` to store the indices of cows with ratings greater than your cow's rating, and `c` to count the number of such cows.
   - It iterates through the list `a` to find the indices of the first two cows with ratings greater than `x` and stores them in `ind`.

3. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - **Case 1: No cows have a higher rating than your cow (`ind` is empty):**
     - If no cow has a higher rating, your cow can win all matches except the last one, so the function returns `n - 1`.
   - **Case 2: Only one cow has a higher rating (`len(ind) == 1`):**
     - If the cow with the higher rating is the first cow (`ind[0] == 0`), your cow can only win up to `k - 1` matches.
     - If the cow with the higher rating is after your cow (`ind[0] > k`), your cow can win up to `ind[0] - 1` matches.
     - If the cow with the higher rating is before your cow (`ind[0] <= k`), the function returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
   - **Case 3: Two cows have higher ratings (`len(ind) == 2`):**
     - If the first cow with a higher rating is the first cow (`ind[0] == 0`), the function returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
     - If your cow is after the second cow with a higher rating (`k > ind[1]`), the function returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
     - If your cow is before or between the two cows with higher ratings, the function returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where there are no cows with a higher rating or only one cow with a higher rating correctly.
   - It also handles the case where your cow is the first or the last cow in the list.

5. **Optimality:**
   - The logic ensures that your cow is placed in the optimal position to maximize the number of wins, either by swapping or by not swapping at all.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve based on the given problem description and constraints. It handles all edge cases and ensures the optimal placement of your cow.

**Correctness: True**
