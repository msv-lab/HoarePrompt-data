Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided program does not perform this calculation. Instead, it calculates a different value that does not correspond to the problem's requirements.

The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` (which should be `m` based on the problem description) and initializes `ans` to `n`. It then iterates over a range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and for each `i` in this range, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`. This calculation does not match the logic required to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided program does not do this, and the logic it uses is unrelated to the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
