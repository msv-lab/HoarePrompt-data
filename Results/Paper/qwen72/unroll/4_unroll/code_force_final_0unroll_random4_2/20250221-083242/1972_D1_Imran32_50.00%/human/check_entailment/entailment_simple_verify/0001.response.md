### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The provided program is:
     ```python
     import math

     t = int(input())
     for _ in range(t):
         func_1()

     def func_1():
         (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
         ans = n
         root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
         for i in range(2, root + 1):
             cnt = i * i
             ans += (n + i) // cnt
         print(ans)
     ```
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - It reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from input.
     - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
     - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
     - It iterates over \(i\) from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
     - For each \(i\), it calculates `cnt` as \(i \times i\).
     - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\) to it.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Logical Errors:**
   - **Incorrect Function Signature:**
     - The function `func_1` reads \(k\) but does not use it. The problem description clearly states that the second integer is \(m\), not \(k\). This suggests that the function is not correctly addressing the problem.
   - **Irrelevant Logic:**
     - The logic inside the loop does not align with the problem's requirements. The loop is iterating over the square root of \(n\) and updating `ans` in a way that does not correspond to the problem's constraints.
     - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked or used in the calculations.
   - **Incorrect Calculation:**
     - The expression \((n + i) // cnt\) does not have any meaningful relationship to the problem's conditions. It is not calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

4. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - **State of the Program Before Function Call:**
     - The function `func_1` is not correctly defined for the given problem. It should take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
   - **State Inside the Function:**
     - `n` and `k` are read from input, but `k` is not used.
     - `ans` is initialized to \(n\).
     - `root` is calculated as \(\text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1\).
     - The loop iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
     - For each \(i\), `cnt` is calculated as \(i \times i\).
     - `ans` is updated by adding \((n + i) // cnt\) to it.
   - **State Before Printing:**
     - `ans` is the sum of the initial value of `ans` and the sum of \((n + i) // (i \times i)\) for each \(i\) in the range from 2 to `root + 1`.
     - `root` remains equal to \(\text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) and does not use the second input \(m\) in any meaningful way.
   - The original assessment correctly identified the logical errors and the mismatch between the problem requirements and the provided code.
