### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**:
   - The problem description requires a function to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, but the function `func_1` is defined to take no parameters. This is a clear mismatch.
   - Inside `func_1`, the function reads two integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to `n` and `k`. However, `k` is not used anywhere in the function, which suggests that the function is not correctly handling the second parameter `m`.

2. **Logic and Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `ans` to `n`.
   - It then calculates `root` as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - The loop iterates from `2` to `root + 1` and updates `ans` by adding `(n + i) // (i * i)` to it.
   - This logic does not match the problem description, which requires finding the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `(2, 3)`, the correct output should be `3` (pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2)).
   - However, the program will calculate `ans` as follows:
     - `n = 2`
     - `root = int(math.sqrt(2)) + 1 = 2`
     - Loop from `2` to `2 + 1`:
       - For `i = 2`:
         - `cnt = 2 * 2 = 4`
         - `ans += (2 + 2) // 4 = 4 // 4 = 1`
     - Final `ans = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - While the final `ans` is `3` for this specific input, this is a coincidence and does not generalize to other inputs. For example, for `(3, 5)`, the correct output should be `4` (pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1)), but the program will calculate:
     - `n = 3`
     - `root = int(math.sqrt(3)) + 1 = 2`
     - Loop from `2` to `2 + 1`:
       - For `i = 2`:
         - `cnt = 2 * 2 = 4`
         - `ans += (3 + 2) // 4 = 5 // 4 = 1`
     - Final `ans = 3 + 1 = 4`
   - This is correct for `(3, 5)`, but the logic is still incorrect and will fail for other inputs.

4. **General Inaccuracy**:
   - The program's logic is fundamentally flawed because it does not correctly implement the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The loop and the calculation of `ans` do not reflect the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The function `func_1` is not correctly defined for the given problem, and the logic inside the function does not match the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
