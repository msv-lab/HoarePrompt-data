### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation and Loop Setup:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is followed by a loop that iterates `t` times, each time reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Sum of Scores Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the total number of points awarded in all games (whether wins, losses, or draws) must be even. Each game results in either 2 points (one win and one loss) or 2 points (one draw), so the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Calculating Total Points:**
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This is the total number of points that could have been awarded if all games were either wins or draws. Since each game awards 2 points, the maximum number of games played is `(a + b + c) // 2`.

4. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The program calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred if the two players with the lowest scores (`a` and `b`) played all their games against each other and all those games ended in draws. This is because the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores is the maximum number of draws they could have contributed to the total score.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is the maximum number of draws that could have occurred, given the constraints. If the sum of the scores is even, the minimum of `x` and `y` will be the correct number of draws.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Odd Sum Check:**
  - The program correctly identifies that if the sum of the scores is odd, it is impossible to achieve the given scores, and it prints `-1`.

- **Total Points Calculation:**
  - The calculation of `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` is correct because it represents the total number of points that could have been awarded in all games.

- **Draws Calculation:**
  - The calculation of `y` as `a + b` is correct because it represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred if the two players with the lowest scores played all their games against each other and all those games ended in draws.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which is the correct maximum number of draws that could have occurred, given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and test cases. It correctly identifies when the scores are impossible and when they are possible, and it calculates the maximum number of draws correctly.

**Correctness: True**
