The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might accept multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` where `0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30`, and the total number of test cases `t` where `1 <= t <= 500`. The function's output is not specified in the prompt, but typically, such a function would return a result based on the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` for each test case.

Since the output is not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the typical behavior of such functions:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` where `0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30`, and the total number of test cases `t` where `1 <= t <= 500`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`.**
