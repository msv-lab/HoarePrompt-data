Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the chosen vertices are not consecutive and the gaps between them are not properly accounted for. Specifically, the logic for calculating the gaps and the number of pairs in the gaps is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
8 4 2
1 3 5 7
```
Expected Output:
```
4
```
The vertices chosen by Bessie are 1, 3, 5, and 7. These vertices form a square, and the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is 4 (by connecting each pair of adjacent vertices with a diagonal).

However, the program will output:
```
6
```
This is incorrect because the program incorrectly calculates the number of triangles that can be formed. The issue lies in the way the gaps are calculated and the number of pairs is determined. The program assumes that adding vertices in the gaps will always increase the number of triangles, but this is not always the case, especially when the vertices are not consecutive.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
