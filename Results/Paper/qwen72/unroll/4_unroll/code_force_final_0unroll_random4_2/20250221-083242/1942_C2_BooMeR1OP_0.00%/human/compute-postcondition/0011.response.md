Output State: **`n` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `y` remains the same, `chosen_vertices` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `present` remains the same, `ans` remains the same, `gaps` is now a sorted list of positive integers representing the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` (considering `a` as a circular list with the last element wrapping around to the first element plus `n`).**
