Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `a` is a list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.** 

The code snippet updates the list `a` by subtracting 1 from each of its elements. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged.
