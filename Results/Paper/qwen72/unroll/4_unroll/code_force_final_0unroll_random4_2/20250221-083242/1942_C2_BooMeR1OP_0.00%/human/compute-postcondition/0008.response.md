Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, `present` is a set containing the elements of `a`, `ans` is `x - 2 + count`, where `count` is the number of times the condition `t1 not in present and t2 in present` is true during the loop iterations, `gaps` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `gaps`. No other variables are affected, so their initial states remain unchanged.
