The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Since `t` is already within this range, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0, and thus the loop can execute.

State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the program is currently executing as the main module.**
