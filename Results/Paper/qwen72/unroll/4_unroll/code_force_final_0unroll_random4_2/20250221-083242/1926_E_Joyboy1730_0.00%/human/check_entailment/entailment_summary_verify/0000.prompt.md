You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow *= 2



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 50,000`. It then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000,000`. The function calculates a value based on `n` and `k` and prints it if a certain condition is met. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the input variables `n` and `k` are not defined outside the loop. The list `L` is empty at the end of each iteration, and the variables `tot` and `pow` are reset for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from working correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues and a specific case where the program fails:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `L` List**: The list `L` is never populated with any values, which means the loop `for a in L:` will never execute. This is a critical flaw because the program relies on this list to determine the number of cards laid down in each step.

2. **Incorrect Logic for `tot` and `k` Updates**: The updates to `tot` and `k` inside the loop are incorrect. The program subtracts `tot` from `k` instead of decrementing `k` by the number of cards laid down in the current step.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`**: The calculation of `m` as `(n + 1) // 2` is not used correctly. It should be used to determine the number of cards laid down in the current step, but the program does not use it in a meaningful way.

4. **Missing Logic for Laying Down Cards**: The program does not correctly lay down the cards in the specified order (odd, twice odd, thrice odd, etc.). It lacks the necessary logic to generate and track the cards laid down in each step.

### Specific Case:
For the input:
```
1
7 1
```
The expected output is `1`, but the program will not produce any output because the list `L` is empty, and the loop `for a in L:` will never execute.

### Corrected Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
1. Generating the list of cards laid down in each step.
2. Tracking the cumulative count of cards laid down.
3. Determining the position `k` within the correct step and calculating the corresponding card.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        step = 1
        while True:
            count = (n + step - 1) // (2 * step)
            if k <= count:
                print(step * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            k -= count
            step += 1
```

This corrected version correctly handles the laying down of cards and ensures that the k-th card is identified accurately for all potential cases.
