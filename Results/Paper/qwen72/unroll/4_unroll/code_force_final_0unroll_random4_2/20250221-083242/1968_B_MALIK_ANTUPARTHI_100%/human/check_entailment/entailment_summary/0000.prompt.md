Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

# Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        print(k)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` and two binary strings `d` and `e` from the input. It then processes these inputs to find the smallest index `k` such that the substring `d[:j+1]` (for some `j` in the range `[0, b-1]`) is a subsequence of `e[k:]`. If such a subsequence is found, it prints the index `k`. If no such subsequence is found, it prints the index of the last character processed in `d`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the value of `a` is decremented by the number of test cases processed, and the values of `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `k` are modified within each iteration but their final values are not predictable without specific inputs. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
