Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly solves the problem based on the provided problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The condition `if n <= k` checks if Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon, which means Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color. If `n <= k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to a single color, so the output is `NO`.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` checks if the number of parts that need to be repainted to make all parts the same color is less than or equal to `k`. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the output is `NO`.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the output is `Yes`.

3. **Output**: The program prints `NO` or `Yes` for each test case, which matches the required output format.

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
