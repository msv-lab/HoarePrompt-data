The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. For each test case, the function evaluates whether `n` is greater than `k` and whether `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is not less than `k`. If both conditions are met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `itest` will retain their final values from the last iteration.
