Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each one. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The first condition `if n <= k` checks if the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`. If this is true, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the program prints 'NO'.
   - The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` checks if the number of parts that are not the most frequent color (after Alice paints) is less than the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this is true, Bob can still make all parts the same color by repainting the necessary parts. The `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of parts that will be painted with the most frequent color if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible. If the remaining parts (i.e., `n - math.ceil(n / m)`) are fewer than `k`, Bob can repaint them all to the most frequent color, so the program prints 'NO'.
   - If neither condition is true, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the test case `1 1 1`, the program correctly prints 'NO' because there is only one part and one color, so Bob can always make all parts the same color.
   - For the test case `5 1 1`, the program correctly prints 'NO' because there is only one color, so Bob can always make all parts the same color.
   - For the test case `5 2 1`, the program correctly prints 'YES' because Alice can paint the ribbon with two colors in such a way that Bob cannot repaint one part to make all parts the same color.
   - For the test case `5 2 2`, the program correctly prints 'NO' because Bob can repaint two parts to make all parts the same color.
   - For the test case `5 5 3`, the program correctly prints 'YES' because Alice can paint each part with a different color, and Bob cannot repaint three parts to make all parts the same color.

4. **Mathematical Validity**:
   - The use of `math.ceil(n / m)` is correct for determining the minimum number of parts that will be painted with the most frequent color when Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is a valid way to check if Bob can repaint the remaining parts to make all parts the same color.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
