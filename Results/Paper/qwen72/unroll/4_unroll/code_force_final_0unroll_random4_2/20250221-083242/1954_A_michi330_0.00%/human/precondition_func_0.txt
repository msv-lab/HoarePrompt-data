The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. The function should be able to read input from stdin where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing the integers n, m, and k.
