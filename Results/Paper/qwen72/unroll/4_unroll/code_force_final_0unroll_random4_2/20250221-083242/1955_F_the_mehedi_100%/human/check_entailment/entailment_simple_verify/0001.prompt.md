You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and each of the four integers p_i in the test cases is an integer such that 0 <= p_i <= 200.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: For each test case, the variable `cnt` is printed, which is the sum of 1 (if the first three integers in the list `a` are odd) and the floor division of each integer in the list `a` by 2. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, a new list `a` is read from input, and a new `cnt` is calculated and printed. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - Eve removes numbers one by one to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

2. **Winning Condition:**
   - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence are all even or all odd.
   - If any of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, or 4s is odd, the XOR will be non-zero, and Alice wins.
   - If all counts are even, the XOR will be zero, and Bob wins.

3. **Eve's Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s remain as even as possible to maximize Bob's wins.
   - Removing one number from an odd count makes it even, and removing one number from an even count makes it odd.

4. **Counting Bob's Wins:**
   - If all counts are odd initially, removing one number will make one count even, and the XOR will be non-zero, so Alice wins.
   - If all counts are even initially, Bob wins immediately.
   - For each pair of numbers (i.e., each even count), removing one number will make the count odd, and the XOR will be non-zero, so Alice wins.
   - Therefore, the number of times Bob can win is the number of even counts plus one if all counts are odd initially.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - It checks if all counts are odd and increments `cnt` by 1 if true.
   - It then adds the floor division of each count by 2 to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies if all counts are odd and increments `cnt` by 1 in that case.
   - The program correctly adds the number of pairs (floor division by 2) to `cnt`.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where all counts are even correctly. If all counts are even, Bob wins immediately, and `cnt` should be the sum of the floor divisions plus one.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where all counts are even correctly. It should add one to `cnt` if all counts are even initially.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
