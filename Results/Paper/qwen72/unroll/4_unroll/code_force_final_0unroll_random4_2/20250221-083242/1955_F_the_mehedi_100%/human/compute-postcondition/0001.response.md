Output State: **For each test case, the variable `cnt` is printed, which is the sum of 1 (if the first three integers in the list `a` are odd) and the floor division of each integer in the list `a` by 2. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, a new list `a` is read from input, and a new `cnt` is calculated and printed. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0.**
