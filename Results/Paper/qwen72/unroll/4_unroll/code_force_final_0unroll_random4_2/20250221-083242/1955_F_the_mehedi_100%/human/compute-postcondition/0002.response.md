The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function operates with an integer `t` and a list of four integers `p_i` where `1 <= t <= 10^4` and `0 <= p_i <= 200`. The function's output is not clearly specified in the provided information, but it is expected to return some value or values based on the input constraints.

Since the function's actual parameters and return values are not explicitly defined in the code snippet, I will assume that the function is designed to process the integer `t` and the list of integers `p_i` and return a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function processes an integer `t` and a list of four integers `p_i` where `1 <= t <= 10^4` and `0 <= p_i <= 200`, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
