Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` starts by reading an integer `t` which is supposed to represent the number of test cases. However, it does not use this value `t` in the subsequent loop. Instead, it always reads 10 pairs of integers, regardless of the value of `t`. This is a clear mismatch with the problem description, which states that the number of test cases `t` should dictate how many pairs of integers are processed.

2. **Loop Iteration**: The loop `for i in range(10)` always iterates 10 times, which is incorrect if `t` is less than 10. This will cause the program to read extra inputs that are not part of the test cases, or it will fail to read all the test cases if `t` is greater than 10.

3. **Output**: The function correctly prints the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers `x[i]` and `y[i]`. However, this is only correct if the number of test cases is exactly 10, which is not guaranteed by the problem description.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle the input as described in the problem statement. It should read `t` pairs of integers and process them accordingly, rather than always reading 10 pairs.

Correctness: **False**
