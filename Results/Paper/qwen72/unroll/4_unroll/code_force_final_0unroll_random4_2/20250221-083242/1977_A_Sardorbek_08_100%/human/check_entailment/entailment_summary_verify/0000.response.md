### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective:** Determine if it is possible to have a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- **Moves:** Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the top of the tower.
- **Constraints:** \(1 \le t \le 100\), \(1 \le n, m \le 100\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` (representing `n` and `m` respectively).

2. **Conditions:**
   - **Case 1:** If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes), the program prints 'YES'.
     - This is correct because if `n == m`, Nikita can simply add 1 cube `n` times to achieve exactly `m` cubes.
   - **Case 2:** If `b` is less than `c`, the program prints 'NO'.
     - This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - **Case 3:** If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), the program prints 'Yes'.
     - This is correct because if `n` and `m` have the same parity, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes by a combination of adding and removing cubes.
   - **Case 4:** If `b` and `c` have different parities, the program prints 'No'.
     - This is correct because if `n` and `m` have different parities, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `b` and `c`.
- It correctly handles the cases where `b == c`, `b < c`, and when `b` and `c` have the same or different parities.
- It prints the appropriate result for each test case and does not return any value.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `n` is less than `m` and incorrectly prints "YES" when `n == m`.
- However, the program does correctly handle the case where `n < m` by printing 'NO'.
- The program also correctly handles the case where `n == m` by printing 'YES', which is the correct behavior.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.
- The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program does not handle the case where `n < m`.

Final: **True**
