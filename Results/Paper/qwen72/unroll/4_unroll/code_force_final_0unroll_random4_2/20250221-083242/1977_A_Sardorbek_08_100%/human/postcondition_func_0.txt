The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `a` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the user input. It then prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` (if they exist) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the function. The variables `b`, `c`, and `q` are updated in each iteration but their final values are not retained after the loop completes.
