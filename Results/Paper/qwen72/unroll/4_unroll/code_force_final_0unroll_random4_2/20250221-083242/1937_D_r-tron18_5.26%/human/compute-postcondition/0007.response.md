To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to understand the structure and values of the `ans` list based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is a list of length `n`.
- Each element in `ans` represents the difference in the cumulative sum of the positions of '>' characters and the cumulative sum of the positions of '<' characters up to that index, adjusted by the total length of the string and the position of the characters.
- `preOne` is an empty list.
- `suffZero` is a list with a single element, 0.
- `totalOne` is 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - The list `ans` is described as having elements that are calculated based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters in a string.
   - However, the string itself is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `ans`.
   - The description of `ans` is quite specific, but without the actual string, we can only describe the elements in terms of the given formula.

2. **Printing `ans`**:
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will unpack the list `ans` and print its elements separated by spaces.
   - Since the exact values of the elements in `ans` are not provided, we will describe the elements in terms of the formula given.

### Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans`, where each element is the difference in the cumulative sum of the positions of '>' characters and the cumulative sum of the positions of '<' characters up to that index, adjusted by the total length of the string and the position of the characters.

Output: **[element_0] [element_1] ... [element_n-1] (where each element_i is the difference in the cumulative sum of the positions of '>' characters and the cumulative sum of the positions of '<' characters up to index i, adjusted by the total length of the string and the position of the characters)**

This output format ensures that the description is precise and understandable, even though the exact numerical values cannot be determined without the string.
