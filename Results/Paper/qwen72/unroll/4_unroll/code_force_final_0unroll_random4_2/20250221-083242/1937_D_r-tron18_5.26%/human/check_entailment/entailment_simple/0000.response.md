### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Calls**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the grid length and string for each test case.
   - It calls `func_2` for each test case, which is the main function responsible for computing the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to calculate the difference between the last element of a list `arr` and the element at a specific index based on `times`.
   - The function is used to compute cumulative sums of positions of characters in the grid, which is a crucial part of the algorithm.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is `>` in the string `s1`.
     - `totalOne` is the count of `>` characters in the string.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of the indices of `>` characters.
     - `suffZero` is initialized to `[0]` and will be used to store the cumulative sum of the indices of `<` characters from the right.
     - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to `0` to store the results for each cell.
   - **Loop**:
     - The loop iterates from the last cell to the first cell.
     - For each cell, it checks if the character is `>` or `<`.
     - If the character is `>`:
       - It calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums and the total counts of `>` and `<` characters.
       - It updates `preOne` and `totalOne` to reflect the removal of the current `>` character.
     - If the character is `<`:
       - It updates `suffZero` to include the current cell's index.
       - It calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums and the total counts of `>` and `<` characters.
   - **Output**:
     - The results are printed as a space-separated list of integers.

4. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The algorithm correctly uses cumulative sums to efficiently calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - The logic for handling the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball is implemented correctly.
   - The conditions and calculations for both `>` and `<` characters are handled appropriately.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as strings with only `>` or only `<` characters.
   - It also handles the general case where the string contains a mix of `>` and `<` characters.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each cell, based on the problem description and the provided comments. The use of cumulative sums and the handling of character inversions are appropriate and efficient.
