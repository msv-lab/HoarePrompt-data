Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. The function `func_1` checks if the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts, swapping them, and checking if the result matches the sorted array. The function `func_2` reads the input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case, appending the results to a list and printing them. The logic in `func_1` is sound and covers the required edge cases, such as when the array is already sorted or when no valid split can make the array sorted. I cannot find a case where the program would fail to produce the correct output.
