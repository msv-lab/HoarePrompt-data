### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times, including zero times.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes an array `a` as input.
   - It first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates the array `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
   - The function checks if any segment of length `n` in `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`.
   - If such a segment is found, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If no such segment is found after checking all possible segments, it returns 'No'.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes `t` with the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array `a` itself.
   - It calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The idea of concatenating the array with itself is correct because it allows us to check all possible splits and swaps.
   - The loop iterates over all possible starting points of segments of length `n` in `concatenated_a`.
   - If any segment matches `sorted_a`, it means that the array can be sorted by performing the swap operation.
   - If no such segment is found, the array cannot be sorted by the given operation.

5. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate array and collects the results.
   - It prints the results in the correct format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the array is already sorted by returning 'Yes'.
   - It also handles the case where the array cannot be sorted by any number of operations by returning 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operation. The input handling and output formatting are also correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
