### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of positive integers and checks if it can be sorted by performing the specified operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them).
   - It first sorts the list `a` to get `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
   - The function iterates through `concatenated_a` and checks if any contiguous subsequence of length `n` (the length of `a`) matches `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subsequence is found, it returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array `a` itself.
   - It calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result on a new line.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The logic of `func_1` is correct. By concatenating `a` with itself, it effectively simulates all possible splits and swaps of the array. If any of these splits and swaps result in a sorted array, the function will find it.
  - The condition `concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a` correctly checks if a contiguous subsequence of `concatenated_a` matches the sorted version of `a`.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
  - It prints the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted by performing the specified operation. Both functions work as intended and handle the input and output correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
