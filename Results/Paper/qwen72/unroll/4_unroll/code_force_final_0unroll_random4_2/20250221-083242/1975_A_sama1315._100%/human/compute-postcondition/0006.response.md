The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, `results`) are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
