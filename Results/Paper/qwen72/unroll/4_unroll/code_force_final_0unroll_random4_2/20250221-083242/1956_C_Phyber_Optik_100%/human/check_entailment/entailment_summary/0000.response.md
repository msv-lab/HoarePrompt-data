Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case, which matches the problem description.
2. The sum calculation in the program is intended to determine the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements. However, the formula used in the program is not correct. The correct formula for the maximum sum should be \( n^3 \) because each element in the matrix can be set to a value between 1 and n, and the maximum sum is achieved when each element is set to n.
3. The program prints `2n` as the number of operations, which is within the allowed limit of no more than 2n operations.
4. The operations printed by the program are valid according to the problem description. For each row and column, it applies a permutation of integers from 1 to n. This ensures that each element in the matrix is set to a value from 1 to n.
5. However, the operations do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix. The operations set each row and column to the same permutation, which does not guarantee that the matrix will contain the maximum possible values (i.e., all elements set to n).

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not provide a valid sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.

Correctness: **False**
