### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \). Assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \). Assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix is achieved when every element in the matrix is the largest possible value, which is \( n \).
   - Therefore, the maximum sum is \( n \times n \times n = n^3 \).

3. **Operations to Achieve the Maximum Sum:**
   - To achieve the maximum sum, we can use the following strategy:
     - Perform \( n \) Type 1 operations to fill each row with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - Perform \( n \) Type 2 operations to fill each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program initializes \( t \) to the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and calculates the sum using the formula \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i \).
   - The formula \( i^2 - (i-1)^2 \) simplifies to \( 2i - 1 \), so the sum calculation becomes \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i \).
   - This simplifies further to \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \).
   - The program then prints the sum and \( 2n \) (the number of operations).
   - It prints \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, each using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

5. **Verification of the Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum calculation in the program is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( n^3 \).
   - The program's sum calculation is \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \), which does not yield \( n^3 \).

6. **Verification of the Operations:**
   - The operations are correct in the sense that they use the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for both rows and columns.
   - However, the operations are not necessary to achieve the maximum sum. We can achieve the maximum sum with fewer operations.

### Conclusion:
The program's sum calculation is incorrect, and it does not provide the correct maximum sum \( n^3 \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
