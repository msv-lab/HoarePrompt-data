Output State: **The loop will have processed all t test cases. For each test case, it will have printed the sum calculated using the formula \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \) followed by \( 2n \). Additionally, for each test case, it will have printed two lines for each row of the n√ón matrix, where the first line starts with 1 and the second line starts with 2, both followed by the row number and a sequence of integers from 1 to n. The variable `t` will be unchanged, and the variable `n` will be the value of the last test case processed.**
