The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. However, it is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5. The function is expected to return the results for each test case, but the specific return values are not provided in the constraints.
