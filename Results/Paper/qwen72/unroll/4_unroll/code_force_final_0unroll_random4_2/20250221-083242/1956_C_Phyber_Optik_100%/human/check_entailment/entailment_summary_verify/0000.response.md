### Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula:
     ```python
     sum = 1
     for i in range(2, n + 1):
         sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
     ```
   - This formula simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
     \]
   - The term \(i^2 - (i-1)^2\) simplifies to \(2i - 1\), so the formula becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i
     \]
   - This further simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - The sum of the series \(2i^2 - i\) from \(i = 2\) to \(n\) is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} 2i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
     \]
   - The sum of \(2i^2\) from \(i = 2\) to \(n\) is:
     \[
     2 \left( \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 \right) = 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right)
     \]
   - The sum of \(i\) from \(i = 2\) to \(n\) is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1
     \]
   - Combining these, the formula becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1 \right) - \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 \right)
     \]
   - Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1) - 3n(n+1)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n - 1)}{6}
     \]
   - However, this formula is not the correct way to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix. The correct maximum sum for an \(n \times n\) matrix with the given operations is \(n^3\).

2. **Operations**:
   - The program outputs \(2n\) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each operation is of the form:
     ```python
     print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```
   - This means that for each row and column, it assigns the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) to the row and column, respectively.
   - For \(n = 2\), the operations are:
     ```
     1 1 1 2
     2 1 1 2
     1 2 1 2
     2 2 1 2
     ```
   - After these operations, the matrix will be:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 \\
     1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The sum of this matrix is \(1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6\), not 7.

3. **Correct Maximum Sum**:
   - The correct maximum sum for an \(n \times n\) matrix is \(n^3\). This is because each element in the matrix can be any integer from 1 to \(n\), and the maximum sum is achieved when each element is \(n\).
   - For \(n = 2\), the correct maximum sum is \(2^3 = 8\), but the problem specifies that the maximum sum is 7, which is achieved by the operations:
     ```
     1 1 1 2
     1 2 1 2
     2 1 1 2
     ```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix and the operations it outputs do not achieve the maximum sum.
- Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
