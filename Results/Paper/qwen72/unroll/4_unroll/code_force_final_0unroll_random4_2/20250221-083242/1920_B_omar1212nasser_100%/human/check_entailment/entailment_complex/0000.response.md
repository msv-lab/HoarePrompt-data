Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases**: The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the list `a`. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted before calling `func_2`. Sorting is necessary because Alice and Bob will make optimal decisions based on the smallest and largest elements, respectively. This is a correct approach.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initial Sum Calculation**: The function starts by calculating the sum of the entire array `s` and the sum of the last `x` elements `s2`. This is correct because Bob will try to minimize the sum by flipping the largest elements.
   - **Adjusting the Sum**: The function then iterates over the possible number of removals from 0 to `k`. For each removal count, it adjusts the sum `s` by subtracting the removed elements and recalculates `s2` by adding the next largest element that Bob can flip.
   - **Calculating the Adjusted Sum**: The adjusted sum is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, which accounts for the sum of the remaining elements after Alice's removals and Bob's flips. This is correct because flipping an element `a` to `-a` changes the sum by `-2 * a`.

4. **Returning the Maximum Sum**: The function `func_2` returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains the adjusted sums for each possible removal count. This ensures that Alice's strategy to maximize the sum is considered for all possible removals.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is equal to `n`, Alice can remove all elements, resulting in a sum of 0.
   - If `x` is equal to `n`, Bob can flip all elements, resulting in a sum of `-sum(a)`.
   - The function handles these edge cases correctly by iterating over all possible removals and selecting the maximum adjusted sum.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The sorting step is \(O(n \log n)\).
   - The iteration over removals is \(O(k)\), which is at most \(O(n)\).
   - The overall complexity is \(O(n \log n + n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for both players playing optimally and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
