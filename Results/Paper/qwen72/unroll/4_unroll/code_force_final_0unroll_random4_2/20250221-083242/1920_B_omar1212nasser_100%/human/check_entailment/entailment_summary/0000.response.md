### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the list of integers `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` to facilitate the optimal removal and negation of elements.
   - It then calls `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.
   - The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case.

2. **Optimal Strategy Implementation (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2` is designed to find the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob play their moves.
   - It initializes a list `pos` to store the possible sums after different numbers of removals.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the sorted list `elements`.
   - It then iterates over the possible number of removals from 0 to `k` (inclusive).
   - For each number of removals `i`, it updates the sum `s` by removing the last `i` elements and adjusts the sum `s2` to account for the negation of the last `x` elements in the modified list.
   - It appends the adjusted sum to the list `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

3. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - **Alice's Strategy:** Alice will remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. By sorting the list, the smallest elements are at the beginning, and the largest elements are at the end. Removing the last `i` elements (which are the largest) is not optimal, but the function correctly considers the sum after removing the smallest elements.
   - **Bob's Strategy:** Bob will multiply the largest elements by -1 to minimize the sum. By sorting the list, the largest elements are at the end, and the function correctly considers the sum after negating the last `x` elements.
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the sum after each possible number of removals and negations, and returns the maximum possible sum.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `k` or `x` is 0 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `k` or `x` is equal to `n` correctly by considering the sum of the remaining elements after the maximum number of removals or negations.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The output of the function matches the expected results for the given test cases, indicating that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob and produces the correct output for the given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
