Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(elements) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 1000. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= removals, negatives <= len(elements). `pos` is a list with `removals + 1` elements, where the last element is `s - 2 * s2`, and `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers. `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` after the first `removals` integers have been removed.**
