The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in the list is between 1 and 1000. The function returns the maximum value from a list `pos` that has `removals + 1` elements. The last element of `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, where `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` after the first `removals` integers have been removed. The other elements in `pos` are not specified but are part of the list.
