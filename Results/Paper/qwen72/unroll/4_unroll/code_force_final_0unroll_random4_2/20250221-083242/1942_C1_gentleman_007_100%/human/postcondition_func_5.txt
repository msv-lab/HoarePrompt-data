The function `func_6` accepts two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of sides of a polygon (4 <= n <= 10^9) and `m` is the number of edges to be marked (0 <= m <= n). It returns a 2D list `l` of size (n+1) x (n+1) where the elements `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` are set to 1 for each pair of integers (x, y) returned by `func_1()` during the loop iterations, and all other elements remain 0. The input parameters `n` and `m` are not modified.
