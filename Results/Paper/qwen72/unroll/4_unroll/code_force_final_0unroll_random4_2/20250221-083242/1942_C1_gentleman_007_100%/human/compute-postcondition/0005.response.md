The only variables in the loop head are `p` and `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `p <= num`. Right before the loop, `p` is 2 and `num` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= num. For the loop to execute the first time, `num` must be at least 2 or greater.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= num; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where the first two elements are `False` and the rest are `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where each element is `0`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where each element is `0`; `p` is 2**
