The function `func_8` accepts a 2D list `l` of integers, where each sublist has the same length. It returns a 2D list `p` of integers with dimensions `(n + 1) x (m + 1)`, where `n` and `m` are the dimensions of `l`. Each element `p[i][j]` in the returned list contains the sum of all elements in the submatrix of `l` from the top-left corner (0,0) to the element at position (i-1, j-1). The function does not modify the input list `l`.
