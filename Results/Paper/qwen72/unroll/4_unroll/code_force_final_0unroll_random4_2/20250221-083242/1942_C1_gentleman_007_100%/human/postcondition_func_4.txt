The function `func_5` accepts two integers, `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of sides of a polygon and `m` is the number of vertices chosen by Bessie (with `0 <= m <= n`). It returns a list `l` of `n + 1` lists. Each inner list at index `x` and `y` contains the values `y` and `x`, respectively, based on pairs of integers `(x, y)` returned by `func_1()`. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` or `m`.
