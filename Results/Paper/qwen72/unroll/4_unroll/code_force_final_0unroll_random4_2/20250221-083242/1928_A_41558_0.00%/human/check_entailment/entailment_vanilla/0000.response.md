### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` which represent the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If both are odd, it prints "NO" because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, it proceeds to the next condition.
   - The program then checks if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". This is because if one dimension is exactly half of the other, cutting the rectangle will result in two smaller rectangles that can only form the original rectangle when recombined, and no new rectangle can be formed.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "YES".

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - **Odd Dimensions**: If both `a` and `b` are odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. This is correct.
   - **Even Dimensions**: If either `a` or `b` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. The program further checks if the cut results in two rectangles that can only form the original rectangle when recombined. This is a valid check because if one dimension is exactly half of the other, the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original when recombined.
   - **Other Cases**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "YES". This is correct because in all other cases, Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting and recombining the pieces.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program outputs "NO" and "YES" in uppercase, which is consistent with the problem's requirement that the output can be in any case.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program correctly handles the problem's requirements and logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
