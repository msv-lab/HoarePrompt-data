The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle. The number of test cases, `t`, is a positive integer. The function should process each test case and return the appropriate output based on the dimensions provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function returns the results for each test case.**
