The only objects in the loop head are the variables `a`, `b`, and the list `edges`. To ensure the loop can execute, `edges` must contain at least one tuple. The variables `a` and `b` will be set to the first tuple in `edges` during the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n representing the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `g` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`, `a` and `b` are set to the first tuple in `edges`**
