Reasoning:

The program aims to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. To understand the correctness of the program, let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The optimal strategy for Alice is to pick the smallest integer that is not in `c` or appears exactly once in `arr` if it is the first unique integer encountered.
   - Bob will try to remove the smallest integer that is not in `c` or appears exactly once in `arr` if it is the first unique integer encountered.

4. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The program iterates through integers from 0 to `n` and checks if the integer `i` is not in `mpp` (the counter of `arr`).
   - If `i` is not in `mpp`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop, as this is the MEX.
   - If `i` is in `mpp` and appears exactly once, it sets `first` to `True` and continues.
   - If `i` is in `mpp` and appears exactly once and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1` exactly once, in which case the MEX is `n`.
   - The program also handles the case where `arr` contains duplicates and missing integers.

6. **Resetting Variables**:
   - The variables `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` are reset for each test case.
   - The variable `first` is reset to `False` for each test case.

The program's logic aligns with the optimal strategy for both players. Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that is not in `c` or appears exactly once, and Bob will try to remove the smallest integer that is not in `c` or appears exactly once. The program correctly identifies the MEX based on these strategies.

Correctness: **True**
