### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategy for both players.
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and has a count of 1 in `a`.
   - Bob will always try to pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and has a count of 1 in `a` to prevent Alice from picking it.
   - If a number has a count of 2 or more, it doesn't matter who picks it first because it will still be in `c` after both players have picked it.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n` to find the smallest number that is not in `a` or the smallest number that has a count of 1 and is picked by Alice first.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `first` to `False`.
   - It iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n`:
     - If the number `i` is not in the `Counter` keys, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If the number `i` has a count of 1 and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If the number `i` has a count of 1, it sets `first` to `True`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest number that is not in `a` or the smallest number that has a count of 1 and is picked by Alice first.
   - The logic ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by considering the smallest numbers first and the counts of those numbers.
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the optimal strategy for both players.

**Correctness: True**
