Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, reads the integer `n` and the list `arr` for each test case, and prints the first integer `i` (0 <= i <= n) that is either not present in `arr` or appears exactly once after the first unique integer has been encountered. The variables `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` are reset for each test case, and the variable `first` is used to track the first unique integer encountered in the current test case. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` are not preserved, and `first` is reset for each test case.**
