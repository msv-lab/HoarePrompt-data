The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided `a` and `n`.
