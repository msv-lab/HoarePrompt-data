Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly follow the problem description and constraints. It uses a series of queries to determine the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, using at most `3n` queries.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum OR Value**:
   - The program initializes `v1` to 0 and iterates over the range `[1, n)`.
   - For each `i`, it asks a query `? v1 v1 i i` to compare `p_v1 | p_v1` with `p_i | p_i`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `v1` to `i`, ensuring that `v1` always holds the index of the maximum value found so far.

3. **Refining the Maximum XOR Pair**:
   - The program initializes `prev` to 0 and iterates over the range `[1, n)`.
   - For each `i`, it asks a query `? v1 i v1 prev` to compare `p_v1 | p_i` with `p_v1 | p_prev`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `prev` to `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it further checks `? i i prev prev` to ensure the correct index is chosen.

4. **Outputting the Result**:
   - After the iterations, the program outputs the indices `prev` and `v1` as the pair that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The program makes at most `2n - 2` queries in the first loop and `n - 1` queries in the second loop, totaling `3n - 3` queries, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

The logic of the program ensures that it correctly identifies the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. The program handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
