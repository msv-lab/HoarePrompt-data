### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries of the form \( ? \ a \ b \ c \ d \), which returns the comparison of \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding the index \( v1 \) such that \( p_{v1} \) is the maximum value in the permutation \( p \). This is done by comparing \( p_i \) with \( p_0 \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - The logic here is to find the maximum value in the permutation, which is a good starting point because the maximum value will likely contribute to a high XOR result.

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
   - Once \( v1 \) is determined, the program tries to find another index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized.
   - It does this by comparing \( (p_{v1} \mid p_i) \) with \( (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}) \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - If \( (p_{v1} \mid p_i) > (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}) \), it updates \( prev \) to \( i \).
   - If \( (p_{v1} \mid p_i) = (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}) \), it further checks \( (p_i \mid p_i) \) with \( (p_{prev} \mid p_{prev}) \) to ensure the correct \( prev \).

4. **Query Efficiency:**
   - The program uses \( n-1 \) queries to find \( v1 \).
   - It then uses up to \( n-1 \) queries to find \( prev \).
   - The total number of queries is \( 2(n-1) \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

5. **Output:**
   - After finding \( prev \) and \( v1 \), the program outputs \( ! \ prev \ v1 \).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it will always find the maximum XOR between the two elements.
   - The program also ensures that the output indices are within the valid range \( 0 \le i, j < n \).

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Finding \( v1 \):**
  - The first loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( p_0 \) with \( p_i \) for each \( i \).
  - If \( p_i \) is greater than \( p_0 \), \( v1 \) is updated to \( i \).
  - This ensures that \( v1 \) is the index of the maximum value in the permutation.

- **Finding \( prev \):**
  - The second loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( (p_{v1} \mid p_i) \) with \( (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}) \).
  - If \( (p_{v1} \mid p_i) > (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}) \), \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).
  - If \( (p_{v1} \mid p_i) = (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}) \), it further checks \( (p_i \mid p_i) \) with \( (p_{prev} \mid p_{prev}) \) to ensure the correct \( prev \).
  - The logic here is to find the index \( i \) that, when XORed with \( p_{v1} \), gives the maximum result.

- **Queries and Efficiency:**
  - The program makes \( n-1 \) queries to find \( v1 \) and \( n-1 \) queries to find \( prev \), totaling \( 2(n-1) \) queries.
  - This is within the allowed limit of \( 3n \) queries.

- **Output:**
  - The program outputs the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \) as the pair that maximizes \( p_i \oplus p_j \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to find the maximum XOR pair using the allowed number of queries. It efficiently narrows down the potential indices and ensures that the final output is valid.
