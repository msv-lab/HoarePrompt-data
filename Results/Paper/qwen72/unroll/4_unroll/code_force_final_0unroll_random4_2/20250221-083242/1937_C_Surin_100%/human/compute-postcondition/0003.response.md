Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, and for each permutation `p` of length `n`, the output is a pair of indices (i, j) such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, with 0 ≤ i, j < n. The variables `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `prev` are updated as per the loop's logic, but the hidden permutation `p` and the function definitions `I` and `R` remain unchanged.**
