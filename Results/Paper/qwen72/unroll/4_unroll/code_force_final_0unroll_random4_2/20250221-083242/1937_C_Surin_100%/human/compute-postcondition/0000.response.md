Output State: **The function `I` is defined as a lambda function that reads a space-separated list of integers from the input and returns it as a list. The hidden permutation `p` and the integer `n` remain unchanged. The function can still make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements from the permutation, and must output a pair of indices (i, j) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, with 0 ≤ i, j < n. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
