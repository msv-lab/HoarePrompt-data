Functionality: ** The function `func` operates in an interactive environment to find and output a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in a hidden permutation `p` is maximized. The function processes multiple test cases, each with a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. After processing each test case, the function outputs a pair of indices (i, j) such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, with 0 ≤ i, j < n. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. The hidden permutation `p` remains unchanged, and the function definitions `I` and `R` are not used in the function. **
