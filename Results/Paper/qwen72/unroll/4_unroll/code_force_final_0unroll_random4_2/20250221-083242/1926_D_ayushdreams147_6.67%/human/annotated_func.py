#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.

        if num not in count:

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique integers in `a` where each integer is considered as its own complement (i.e., `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`), and `count` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` or its complement, and the value is the count of how many times the complement has been encountered minus the number of times the integer itself has been encountered.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in list `a` where each integer is considered as its own complement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the number of unique integers in `a` where each integer is considered as its own complement (i.e., `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`). The function modifies a dictionary `count` to track the complement of each integer in `a` and updates the result `res` accordingly. After the function concludes, `res` contains the count of unique integers in `a` based on their complements.
