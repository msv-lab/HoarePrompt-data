You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
    return res



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the number of unique integers in `a` where each integer is considered as its own complement (i.e., `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`). The function modifies a dictionary `count` to track the complement of each integer in `a` and updates the result `res` accordingly. After the function concludes, `res` contains the count of unique integers in `a` based on their complements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among the 31 least significant bits. The program attempts to use a dictionary to count the occurrences of numbers with their 31st bit flipped, but this approach is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The binary representations of these numbers are:
- 1: 000...0001
- 2: 000...0010
- 3: 000...0011
- 4: 000...0100

According to the problem description, no two numbers in the same group should have matching bits in any of the 31 least significant bits. However, the program will incorrectly place these numbers into groups based on the 31st bit, which is not the correct approach. The program should consider all 31 bits for each number to ensure no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.

A correct approach would involve using a bitmask to represent the 31 least significant bits of each number and then using a set to ensure that no two numbers with the same bitmask are placed in the same group. The minimum number of groups required would be the number of unique bitmasks.
