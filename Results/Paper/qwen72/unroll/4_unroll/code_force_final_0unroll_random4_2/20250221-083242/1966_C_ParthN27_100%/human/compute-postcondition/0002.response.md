The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `piles`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and each test case is an inner list within `piles` that contains `n` integers, where each integer represents the number of stones in each pile. The constraints are as follows: `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`, and each integer in the inner lists (a_i) is in the range `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2·10^5`.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines the outcome based on the number of stones in each pile.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `piles`, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It returns a list of results, where each result indicates the outcome for the corresponding test case based on the number of stones in the piles.**
