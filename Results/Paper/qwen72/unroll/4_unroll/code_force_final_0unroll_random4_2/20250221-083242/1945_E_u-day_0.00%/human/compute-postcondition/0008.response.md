To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition `low + 1 < high`. The variables `low` and `high` are the only ones that can be adjusted to meet this condition.

### Initial State:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n - 1`

### Condition Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `low + 1 < high`.
- Substituting the initial values, the condition becomes `0 + 1 < n - 1`, which simplifies to `1 < n - 1`.
- This further simplifies to `n > 2`.

### Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set, and `n` must be greater than 2**
