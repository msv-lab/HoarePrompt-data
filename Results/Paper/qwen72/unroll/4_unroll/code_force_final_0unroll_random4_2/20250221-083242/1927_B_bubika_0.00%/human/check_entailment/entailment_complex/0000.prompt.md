Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists a, where each inner list contains n integers (0 \le a_i < n) representing the trace of a string. Each inner list a corresponds to a test case, and the length n of each trace satisfies (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    b = [0] * 26
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        r = ''
        
        for i in s:
            x = b.index(i)
            r += a[x]
            b[x] += 1
        
        print(r)
        
    #State: The variable `b` will contain the counts of how many times each character in the string `a` was used to construct the output strings `r` for all test cases. The variable `a` remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The loop will print the constructed string `r` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads input from the standard input. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer provided by the user. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `s`. The function constructs a string `r` by mapping each integer in `s` to a character in the alphabet (from 'a' to 'z') based on the current count of each character stored in the list `b`. The constructed string `r` is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the list `b` contains the counts of how many times each character in the alphabet was used to construct the output strings, and the string `a` remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The function does not return any value.
