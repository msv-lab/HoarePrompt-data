The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input through a predefined mechanism, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells on a ribbon, followed by a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for a chip). There is at least one chip in each test case. The function processes this input and returns the minimum number of moves required to place all chips in the same cell. Each move consists of moving a chip from one cell to an adjacent cell.

Functionality: **The function reads input consisting of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the state of a ribbon. It returns the minimum number of moves required to place all chips (represented by 1s) in the same cell.**
