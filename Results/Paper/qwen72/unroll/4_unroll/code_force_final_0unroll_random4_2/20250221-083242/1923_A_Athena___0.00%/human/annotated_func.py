#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined input mechanism, as it does not have any parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells on the ribbon, followed by a list of n integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for a chip). There is at least one chip in each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `t` times, and for each test case, the list `a` will be printed after removing leading and trailing zeros, and the integer `res` will be printed, representing the number of zeros remaining in the list `a`. The variables `n` and `a` will be overwritten in each iteration, and `res` will be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. After all iterations, the final values of `n`, `a`, and `res` will be those of the last test case, with `a` being the list after removing leading and trailing zeros, and `res` being the count of zeros in this final `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input consisting of multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes a list of integers representing the state of a ribbon, where 0s indicate free cells and 1s indicate cells with chips. It removes leading and trailing zeros from the list and prints the modified list. Then, it counts the number of zeros remaining in the list and prints this count. The function does not return any value; it only prints the modified list and the count of zeros for each test case. After processing all test cases, the final values of `n`, `a`, and `res` will be those of the last test case, with `a` being the list after removing leading and trailing zeros, and `res` being the count of zeros in this final `a`.
