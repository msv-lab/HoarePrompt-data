The function `func` reads input consisting of multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes a list of integers representing the state of a ribbon, where 0s indicate free cells and 1s indicate cells with chips. It removes leading and trailing zeros from the list and prints the modified list. Then, it counts the number of zeros remaining in the list and prints this count. The function does not return any value; it only prints the modified list and the count of zeros for each test case. After processing all test cases, the final values of `n`, `a`, and `res` will be those of the last test case, with `a` being the list after removing leading and trailing zeros, and `res` being the count of zeros in this final `a`.
