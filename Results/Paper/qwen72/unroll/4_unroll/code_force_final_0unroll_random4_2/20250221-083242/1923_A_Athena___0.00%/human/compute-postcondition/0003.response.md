Output State: **The loop will have executed `t` times, and for each test case, the list `a` will be printed after removing leading and trailing zeros, and the integer `res` will be printed, representing the number of zeros remaining in the list `a`. The variables `n` and `a` will be overwritten in each iteration, and `res` will be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. After all iterations, the final values of `n`, `a`, and `res` will be those of the last test case, with `a` being the list after removing leading and trailing zeros, and `res` being the count of zeros in this final `a`.**
