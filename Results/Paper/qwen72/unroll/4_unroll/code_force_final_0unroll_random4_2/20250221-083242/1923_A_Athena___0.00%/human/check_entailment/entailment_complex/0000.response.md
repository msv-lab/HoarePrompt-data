### Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to move chips on a ribbon so that all chips form a single block without any free cells between them. However, the current implementation has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum number of operations.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the state of the ribbon `a`.

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The function removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`. This step is intended to focus on the segment of the ribbon that contains chips.
   - However, this step alone does not help in determining the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

3. **Counting Zeros:**
   - The function then counts the number of zeros in the modified list `a` and prints this count.
   - This count of zeros is not the correct answer to the problem. The number of zeros in the list does not directly correspond to the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Identify the positions of all chips in the list `a`.
2. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. This can be done by finding the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips to a contiguous segment.

### Example:
For the input:
```
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
- The positions of the chips are: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.
- The goal is to move these chips to form a single block. The optimal way is to move the chip at position 7 to position 5, which requires 1 operation. The chips will then be at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

### Correctness:
The current implementation does not correctly solve the problem because it simply counts the number of zeros in the list after removing leading and trailing zeros, which is not the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
