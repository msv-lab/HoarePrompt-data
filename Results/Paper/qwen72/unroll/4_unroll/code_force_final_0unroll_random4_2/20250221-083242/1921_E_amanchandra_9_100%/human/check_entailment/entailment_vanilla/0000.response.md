### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` which represent the height of the board, width of the board, Alice's initial position, and Bob's initial position respectively.

2. **Initial Position Check:**
   - The function checks if Alice's initial row `a` is greater than Bob's initial row `c`. If `a > c`, it immediately prints "Draw" because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down, so they will never meet if Alice starts below Bob.

3. **Move Calculation:**
   - If `a <= c`, the function calculates the number of moves `x` required for Alice and Bob to potentially meet. This is done using `x = abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - The function then checks if the number of moves is odd or even to determine the player who will make the final move.

4. **Odd Number of Moves:**
   - If the number of moves is odd (`abs(a - c) % 2`), Alice will make the final move.
   - The function calculates the range of possible columns `l` and `r` where Alice and Bob can meet after `x` moves.
   - It then checks if Alice's initial column `b` is within the range `l` to `r` and if the distance from `b` to the edges of the range is less than or equal to `x + 1`. If so, Alice can win; otherwise, it's a draw.

5. **Even Number of Moves:**
   - If the number of moves is even, Bob will make the final move.
   - The function calculates the range of possible columns `l` and `r` where Alice and Bob can meet after `x` moves.
   - It then checks if Bob's initial column `d` is within the range `l` to `r` and if the distance from `d` to the edges of the range is less than or equal to `x`. If so, Bob can win; otherwise, it's a draw.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for determining the number of moves and the range of possible meeting columns is correct.
- The conditions for checking if Alice or Bob can win are also correct. Alice can win if she can move to a column where Bob is or will be, and Bob can win if he can move to a column where Alice is or will be.
- The function correctly handles the edge cases where the initial positions of Alice and Bob are such that they cannot meet within the board boundaries.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the given problem description. It handles all the edge cases and conditions as required.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
