Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the outcome of the game is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 4 1 1 4 4
```

Expected Output:
```
Draw
```

Actual Output:
```
Alice
```

In this case, Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (4, 4). Alice can only move down, down-right, or down-left, and Bob can only move up, up-right, or up-left. Given the initial positions, neither Alice nor Bob can move to a position where they can capture the other's chip. Therefore, the game should end in a draw. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Alice" as the winner. This indicates that the program's logic for determining the game outcome is not correct for all potential cases.
