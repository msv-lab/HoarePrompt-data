Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few logical issues that can lead to incorrect outcomes in certain scenarios. Here are the problems:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`**: The variable `x` is calculated as `abs(a - c) // 2`. This is intended to represent the number of moves it would take for Alice and Bob to potentially meet, but it is not always correct. For example, if Alice and Bob are on the same row but different columns, `x` should be 0, not a value based on the row difference.

2. **Incorrect Use of `l` and `r`**: The program calculates `l` and `r` differently based on whether `abs(a - c)` is even or odd. However, the logic for determining the range of possible positions for Alice and Bob to meet is flawed. The ranges should be calculated based on the possible movements of both players, not just one.

3. **Incorrect Condition for Alice's Win**: The condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is not correct for determining if Alice can win. Alice can win if she can move to Bob's current position in her turn, which should be checked more directly.

4. **Incorrect Condition for Bob's Win**: Similarly, the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` is not correct for determining if Bob can win. Bob can win if he can move to Alice's current position in his turn, which should be checked more directly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x_a > x_b:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            # Calculate the number of moves it would take for Alice and Bob to potentially meet
            moves = (x_b - x_a) // 2
            
            # Check if Alice can win in her turn
            if (x_b - x_a) % 2 == 1:
                # Alice moves first, so she can win if she can move to Bob's position
                if abs(y_a - y_b) <= moves + 1:
                    print('Alice')
                else:
                    print('Draw')
            else:
                # Bob moves first, so he can win if he can move to Alice's position
                if abs(y_a - y_b) <= moves:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Draw')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version properly checks the conditions for Alice and Bob to win or if the game ends in a draw. It ensures that the number of moves and the possible positions are correctly calculated and compared.
