#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each test case, the grid is represented by two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}...a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}...a_{2n} where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())

    #State: The loop has finished executing `t` times. For each iteration, `n` is updated to the integer value read from the input, `a` and `b` are updated to the strings read from the input, and `ans` is a string constructed based on the conditions in the loop. The variable `counter` is updated to the number of consecutive positions where `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]` or `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', starting from the beginning of the strings `a` and `b`. After all iterations, `t` is unchanged, `n` is the last integer read from the input, `a` and `b` are the last strings read from the input, and `counter` is the last calculated value for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. It then constructs a string `ans` by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on specific conditions and prints `ans`. Additionally, it calculates and prints the number of consecutive positions starting from the beginning where `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]` or `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case.
