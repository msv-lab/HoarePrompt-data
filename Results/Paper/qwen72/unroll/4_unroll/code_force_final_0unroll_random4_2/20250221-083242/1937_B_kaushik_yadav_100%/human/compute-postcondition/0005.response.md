Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. It then constructs a string `ans` by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on specific conditions and prints `ans`. Additionally, it calculates and prints the number of consecutive positions starting from the beginning where `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]` or `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case. **
