The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take the value of 0 at the start of the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0**
