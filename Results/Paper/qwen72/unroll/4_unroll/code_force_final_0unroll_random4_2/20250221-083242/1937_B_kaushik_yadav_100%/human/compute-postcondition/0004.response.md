The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and two binary strings `a1` and `a2`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, representing the length of the binary strings. `a1` and `a2` are binary strings of length `n`, where each character in the strings is either '0' or '1'. For each test case, the function processes the grid represented by these two binary strings and returns a result based on the processing of the grid.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5), and two binary strings `a1` and `a2` of length `n`. For each test case, it processes the grid represented by `a1` and `a2` and returns a result based on the processing of the grid.**
