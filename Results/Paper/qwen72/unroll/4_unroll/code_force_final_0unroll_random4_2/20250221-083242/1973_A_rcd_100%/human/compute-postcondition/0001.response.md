The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` does not affect the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is a placeholder variable that will be set by the loop itself.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable**
