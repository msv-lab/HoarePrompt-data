You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:

                    print(p1 - x + p3)

                print(p3)
        
    #State: The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, but the loop has printed the results of the calculations for each test case. For each test case, if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `-1` is printed. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the sum of `p1` and `p2` is printed. Otherwise, the loop finds a pair `(x, y)` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y` and prints `p1 - x + p3`. If no such pair is found, `p3` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input, where `0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30`. The function then processes these values and prints a result for each test case. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, it prints `-1`. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, it finds a pair `(x, y)` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y` and prints `p1 - x + p3`. If no such pair is found, it prints `p3`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged after the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific case where the program fails is when the scores are such that the maximum number of draws is not correctly calculated. For example, consider the input `3 4 5`:

- The program should output `6` because the scores can be achieved with 6 draws (each player gets 1 point per draw) and 0 wins/losses.
- However, the program outputs `5`, which is incorrect.

Let's break down the logic and see why it fails:

1. The program checks if the total score is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This part is correct because the total score must be even for the game results to be valid.

2. If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` in this case.

3. If the above condition is not met, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. The loop logic is flawed. It tries to find a balance between `p1` and `p2` by decrementing `y` and incrementing `x` until `y >= x`. However, this logic does not always correctly calculate the maximum number of draws.

For the input `3 4 5`:
- The program will set `x = 0` and `y = 5`.
- It will then check if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, which is `3 - 0 <= 4 - 5`, or `3 <= -1`, which is false.
- It will increment `x` and decrement `y` to `x = 1` and `y = 4`.
- It will check if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, which is `3 - 1 <= 4 - 4`, or `2 <= 0`, which is false.
- It will increment `x` and decrement `y` to `x = 2` and `y = 3`.
- It will check if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, which is `3 - 2 <= 4 - 3`, or `1 <= 1`, which is true.
- It will print `p1 - x + p3`, which is `3 - 2 + 5 = 6`, but the loop logic is flawed and it prints `5` instead.

This is a clear case where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
