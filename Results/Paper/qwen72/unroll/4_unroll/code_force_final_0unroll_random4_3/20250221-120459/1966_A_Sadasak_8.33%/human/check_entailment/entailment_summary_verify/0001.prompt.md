You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    elif k == n:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value for each key is the minimum of `k` and the number of times that integer appears in `arr`. The function ensures that no value in the dictionary exceeds `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange value `k`, and then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, no operations can be performed, and the minimum number of cards left is `n`.
   - The program also checks if `k` is equal to `n`. If so, one operation can be performed to reduce the number of cards to `k-1`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the frequency of each card number in the list `nums`.
   - The function ensures that no frequency exceeds `k` by setting any frequency greater than `k` to `k`.

4. **Final Check:**
   - The program checks if any frequency in the `freq` dictionary is exactly `k`.
   - If a frequency is exactly `k`, it prints `k-1` because one operation can be performed to reduce the number of cards by 1.
   - If no frequency is exactly `k`, it prints `n`, which is incorrect.

### Analysis of the Final Check:
- The logic in the final check is flawed. The program should not print `n` if no frequency is exactly `k`. Instead, it should determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.
- The correct approach would be to calculate the total number of cards that can be removed by repeatedly performing the operation on groups of cards with frequencies greater than or equal to `k`.

### Correct Approach:
- For each card number with a frequency `f`:
  - If `f` is a multiple of `k`, all `f` cards can be removed.
  - If `f` is not a multiple of `k`, the remaining cards after performing the operation as many times as possible will be `f % k`.

- The minimum number of cards left is the sum of the remainders for all card numbers.

### Conclusion:
- The program's final check is incorrect, and it does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        min_cards_left = sum(f % k for f in freq.values())
        print(min_cards_left)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

This fix correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.
