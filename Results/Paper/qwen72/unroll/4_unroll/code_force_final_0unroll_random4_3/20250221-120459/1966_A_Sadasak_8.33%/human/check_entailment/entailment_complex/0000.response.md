Reasoning:

The program's logic is flawed in its approach to determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Conditions**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange number `k`, and then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k > n`, the program correctly prints `n` because you cannot perform any operations.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1`, which is incorrect. If you have exactly `k` cards, you can perform one operation and be left with `k - 1` cards, but if you have more than one set of `k` cards, you should be able to reduce the number further. The correct logic should consider the possibility of multiple sets of `k` cards.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the frequency of each card number in the list `nums`, but it caps the frequency at `k`. This is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a number appears `2k` times, the function will cap it at `k`, which is incorrect.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The program checks if any frequency in the `frequency_table` is exactly `k` and prints `k - 1` if so. This is not the correct approach. The minimum number of cards left should be determined by the total number of cards and the frequency of each card number.
   - If no frequency is exactly `k`, the program prints `n`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.

### Correct Approach:
- **Count the frequency of each card number**.
- **Calculate the minimum number of cards left**:
  - For each card number, determine how many full sets of `k` cards you can exchange.
  - The remaining cards after all possible exchanges should be the minimum number of cards left.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `5 3` and `4 1 1 4 4`, the correct output is `2` (as shown in the example).
- For the input `1 10` and `7`, the correct output is `1` (no operations can be performed).
- For the input `7 2` and `4 2 1 100 5 2 3`, the correct output is `1` (you can exchange pairs of cards to reduce the count).
- For the input `10 4` and `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`, the correct output is `2` (you can exchange 4 cards at a time to reduce the count).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. It fails to account for multiple sets of `k` cards and incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`.

Correctness: **False**
