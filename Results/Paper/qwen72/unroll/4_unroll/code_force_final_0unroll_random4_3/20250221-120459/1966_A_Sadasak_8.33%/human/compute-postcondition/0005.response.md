Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value for each key is the minimum of `k` and the number of times that integer appears in `arr`. The function ensures that no value in the dictionary exceeds `k`. **
