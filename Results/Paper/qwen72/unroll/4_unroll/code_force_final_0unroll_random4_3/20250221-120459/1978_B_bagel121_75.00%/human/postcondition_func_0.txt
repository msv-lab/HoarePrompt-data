The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates a value `ans` based on the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, and prints the sum of `ans` and `(n - k) * a`, where `k` is the calculated minimum value. After processing all test cases, the function does not retain any of the input variables, and their final values are undefined. The function does not return any value.
