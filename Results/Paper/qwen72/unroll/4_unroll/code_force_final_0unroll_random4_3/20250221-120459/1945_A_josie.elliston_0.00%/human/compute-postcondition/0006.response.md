The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. Both `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers, with values ranging from 0 to 10^9. 

- **Case_1**: If the function is called under certain conditions not specified in the constraints, it returns `None`.
- **Case_2**: If the function is called with valid parameters, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integers, `extroverts` and `universals`, and returns the ceiling of the division of their sum by 3. If the conditions for this calculation are not met, it returns `None`.**
