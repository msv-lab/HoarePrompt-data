You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional
#Function 1:
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

#Function 2:
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts three non-negative integer parameters `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, each ranging from 0 to 10^9. It returns -1 if `func_1(extroverts, universals)` returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (1, 2, or 3).

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3. If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is at least 3. If not, it returns `None` because it's impossible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts and universals.
   - If the above condition is satisfied, it returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Introverts:** If there are only introverts, the number of tents needed is exactly the number of introverts.
   - **All Extroverts:** If there are only extroverts, the number of tents needed is `ceil(extroverts / 3)`.
   - **All Universals:** If there are only universals, the number of tents needed is `ceil(universals / 3)`.
   - **Mixed Cases:** The function should handle cases where there are a mix of introverts, extroverts, and universals.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `1 2 3`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 2 (2 extroverts + 1 universal in 1 tent, 2 universals in 1 tent)
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
   - **Test Case 2:** `1 4 1`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (4 extroverts + 1 universal in 1 tent, but 1 universal is not enough to form a tent with 4 extroverts)
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible)
   - **Test Case 3:** `1 4 2`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (4 extroverts + 2 universals in 2 tents)
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
   - **Test Case 4:** `1 1 1`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 1 (1 extrovert + 1 universal in 1 tent, but 1 universal is not enough to form a tent with 1 extrovert)
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible)
   - **Test Case 5:** `1 3 2`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 3 (3 extroverts in 1 tent, 2 universals in 1 tent)
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
   - **Test Case 6:** `19 7 18`
     - Introverts: 19 (19 tents)
     - Extroverts: 7 (7 extroverts + 18 universals in 7 tents, 11 universals in 4 tents)
     - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 9 (extroverts and universals) = 28
   - **Test Case 7:** `0 0 0`
     - No participants, so no tents are needed.
     - Total tents: 0
   - **Test Case 8:** `7 0 0`
     - Introverts: 7 (7 tents)
     - No extroverts or universals.
     - Total tents: 7
   - **Test Case 9:** `0 24 0`
     - No introverts or universals.
     - Extroverts: 24 (24 / 3 = 8 tents)
     - Total tents: 8
   - **Test Case 10:** `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
     - Introverts: 1000000000 (1000000000 tents)
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 (1000000000 / 3 = 333333333.33, rounded up to 333333334 tents)
     - Universals: 1000000000 (1000000000 / 3 = 333333333.33, rounded up to 333333334 tents)
     - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 333333334 (extroverts and universals) = 1333333334

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles all the test cases and edge cases. It ensures that the number of tents is minimized while respecting the preferences of introverts, extroverts, and universals. The logic is sound and the implementation is correct.
