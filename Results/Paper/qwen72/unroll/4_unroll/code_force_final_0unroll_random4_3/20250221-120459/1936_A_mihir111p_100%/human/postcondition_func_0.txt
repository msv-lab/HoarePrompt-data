The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, each less than `n` where `2 <= n <= 10^4`. It prints a query string in the format `? [a] [b] [c] [d]` and then returns the user's input as a string. After the function concludes, the user's input is available as the return value, and the original parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.
