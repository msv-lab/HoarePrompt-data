The print statement will output a string that starts with a question mark followed by the values of the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. According to the initial state, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c, d < n\), and `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, we can only describe them based on the given conditions. The output will be a formatted string where the question mark is followed by the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

Output: **? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, and n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 10^4)**
