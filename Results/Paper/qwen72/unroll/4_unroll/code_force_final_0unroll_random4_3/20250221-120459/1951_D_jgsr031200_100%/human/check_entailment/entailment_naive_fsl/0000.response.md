Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. The program attempts to set up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`, but this approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. 

For example, consider the case where `n = 10` and `k = 3`. According to the program, the costs will be `[8, 1]`. However, with these costs:
- At the first stall, Alice can buy 1 jewel and is left with 2 coins.
- At the second stall, Alice can buy 2 more jewels and is left with 0 coins.
- In total, Alice buys 3 jewels, which is correct.

However, consider the case where `n = 10` and `k = 4`. According to the program, the costs will be `[7, 1]`. However, with these costs:
- At the first stall, Alice can buy 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins.
- At the second stall, Alice can buy 3 more jewels and is left with 0 coins.
- In total, Alice buys 4 jewels, which is correct.

But consider the case where `n = 10` and `k = 5`. According to the program, the costs will be `[6, 1]`. However, with these costs:
- At the first stall, Alice can buy 1 jewel and is left with 4 coins.
- At the second stall, Alice can buy 4 more jewels and is left with 0 coins.
- In total, Alice buys 5 jewels, which is correct.

However, consider the case where `n = 10` and `k = 6`. According to the program, the costs will be `[5, 1]`. However, with these costs:
- At the first stall, Alice can buy 2 jewels and is left with 0 coins.
- At the second stall, Alice cannot buy any more jewels.
- In total, Alice buys 2 jewels, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
