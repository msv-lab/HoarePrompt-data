The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. The function has two possible outcomes based on these inputs:

- Case_1: The function returns `None`.
- Case_2: The function does not return anything (i.e., it returns `None` implicitly).

Since both cases result in the function returning `None`, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k` and always return `None`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` and always returns `None`.**
