Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it is a constant).
- `costs` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it is a list).
- `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `n // (n - k + 1)`**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n - k + 1` becomes `0 - k + 1` which simplifies to `1 - k`.
   - `n // (n - k + 1)` becomes `0 // (1 - k)`.
   - Since `n` is 0, `0 // (1 - k)` is 0 for any value of `k` (as long as `k` is not 1, which would cause a division by zero error).

2. **Calculate `n // 1`**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // 1` becomes `0 // 1`, which is 0.

3. **Sum of the two values**:
   - `h` is the sum of `0` and `0`, which is `0`.

4. **Check the condition `h >= k`**:
   - `h` is 0.
   - The condition `0 >= k` must be true.
   - This implies that `k` must be 0 or less than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(*costs)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print(*costs)` statement will print the elements of the `costs` list, separated by spaces.
- The value of `costs` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact elements of the list.
- However, we know that `costs` is a list, and the `*` operator will unpack the list and print its elements.

### Output:
Output: **[elements of the `costs` list separated by spaces] (where `costs` is the list of integers)**

Since the exact elements of `costs` are not provided, the output will be the elements of the `costs` list separated by spaces.
