### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` (number of coins Alice has) and `k` (number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from one stall if each jewel costs 1 coin.
   - If `n < k`, the program prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **Stall Setup:**
   - The program sets up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - The first stall price is `n - k + 1`, which ensures that Alice can buy at most one jewel from this stall (since `n - (n - k + 1) + 1 = k`).
   - The second stall price is 1, which allows Alice to buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall using integer division and updates the remaining coins.
   - It then checks if the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is at least `k`.

5. **Output:**
   - If `h < k`, the program prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `h >= k`, the program prints "YES" and the stall setup with the prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - For `n == k`, the program correctly prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1. This ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
  - For `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

- **General Case:**
  - The program sets up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
  - From the first stall, Alice will buy `n // (n - k + 1)` jewels. Since `n - k + 1` is the price per jewel, and `n` is the total number of coins, the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy from the first stall is 1 (because `n // (n - k + 1)` is always 1 when `n >= k`).
  - From the second stall, Alice will buy `n // 1` jewels, which is `n` jewels. However, after buying from the first stall, the remaining coins are `n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1`. Therefore, Alice will buy exactly `k - 1` jewels from the second stall.
  - The total number of jewels bought is `1 + (k - 1) = k`, which is exactly what Bob wants.

- **Stall Limit:**
  - The program always sets up 2 stalls, which is within the limit of 60 stalls.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and output for the given problem description. It handles all edge cases and the general case correctly, ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels if possible, and prints "NO" if it is not possible.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
