Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `paths` is a list of strings where each string `s` has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and consists of characters '.', '@', and '*', and the first cell of each string is guaranteed to be empty; `s` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `a` remains unchanged because it is only used to determine the number of iterations of the outer loop.
- The variable `t` is not affected by the loop.
- The variable `paths` is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `s` is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration of the outer loop, so it will always be 0 after the loop finishes executing.
