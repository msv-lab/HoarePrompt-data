The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of strings `paths`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and the list `paths` contains strings where each string `s` has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and consists of characters '.', '@', and '*', representing empty cells, cells with coins, and cells with thorns, respectively. The first cell of each string is guaranteed to be empty.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if it is possible to move from the first cell to the last cell of the string, collecting coins ('@') and avoiding thorns ('*'). If the path is possible, the function returns "safe" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "dangerous".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of strings `paths`. It returns a list of results where each result is "safe" if the path from the first cell to the last cell in the corresponding string can be traversed without encountering thorns, and "dangerous" otherwise.**
