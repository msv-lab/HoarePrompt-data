Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of elements in `a` that remain after removing the longest prefix or suffix of consecutive equal elements. If the first and last elements of `a` are the same, it removes both the prefix and suffix of equal elements and prints the number of remaining unique elements. The function does not return any value, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are reinitialized for each test case. **
