### Reasoning:

1. **Function Signature and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of integers `arr`.

2. **Counter Usage:**
   - The function uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. This is a good approach to quickly determine the frequency of each element.

3. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The function iterates through the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive) to find the smallest integer `i` that is not present in `arr`. This is a correct way to find the MEX.
   - If all integers from 0 to `n` are present in `arr`, the function then checks for the smallest integer that appears exactly once after the first integer that appears exactly once. This is a bit more complex but is necessary to ensure optimal play by both Alice and Bob.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, and Bob wants to minimize it. The function correctly identifies the MEX by first checking for the smallest integer not present in `arr`.
   - If all integers from 0 to `n` are present, the function ensures that the smallest integer that appears exactly once is chosen after the first such integer is found. This is a reasonable heuristic for optimal play, as it ensures that Alice and Bob are making the best possible moves given the constraints.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the MEX for each test case, which is the expected output format.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem.
- The logic for finding the MEX and ensuring optimal play by both Alice and Bob is sound and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
