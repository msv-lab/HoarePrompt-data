#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. Additionally, the function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, each defined by the integer `t` and the list `a` of size `n` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 0 ≤ a_i < n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: The loop has processed all the test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the smallest integer that is not present in the list `arr` or the smallest integer that appears exactly once after the first integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` are reset for each test case, and `mpp` and `first` are updated within each iteration of the test case loop. After the loop finishes, the values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` are undefined, but the overall state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding outputs have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` of size `n`. It then finds and prints the smallest integer that is not present in `arr` or, if all integers from 0 to `n` are present, the smallest integer that appears exactly once after the first integer that appears exactly once in `arr`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` are undefined, and the program state is that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding outputs have been printed.
