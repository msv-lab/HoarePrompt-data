Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the given description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually, which is consistent with the problem's input format.

2. **Counter Usage**: The program uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`. This is efficient and appropriate for the problem.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - **Alice's Turn**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX. She will choose elements that are not already in `c` or that are unique in `arr` to delay the inclusion of smaller numbers in `c`.
   - **Bob's Turn**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX. He will choose elements that are already in `c` or that are unique in `arr` to include smaller numbers in `c`.

4. **Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
   - It checks if the current number `i` is not in the `Counter` (i.e., it is the MEX of the current `c`).
   - If `i` is not in the `Counter`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop, as this is the MEX of `c`.
   - If `i` is in the `Counter` and its count is 1, and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This ensures that Bob has already picked a unique element, and Alice cannot pick it to maximize the MEX.
   - If `i` is in the `Counter` and its count is 1, it sets `first` to `True`, indicating that Bob will pick this unique element on his next turn.

The program correctly handles the optimal strategies for both players and prints the correct MEX for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
