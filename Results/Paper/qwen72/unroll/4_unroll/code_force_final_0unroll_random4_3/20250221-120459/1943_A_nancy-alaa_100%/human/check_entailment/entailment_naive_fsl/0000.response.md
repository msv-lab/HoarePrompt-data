Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players. Specifically, the program does not ensure that Alice and Bob are making optimal moves to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```
The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would be:
1. Alice picks 2 (since it appears twice and is the smallest number that can be picked to maximize the MEX).
2. Bob picks 0.
3. Alice picks 1.
4. Bob picks 2.
5. Alice picks 3.

At the end, the array `c` would be `[2, 1, 3]`, and the MEX of `c` would be 0. However, the program will output 2, which is incorrect.

### Why the Program Fails:
- The program does not consider the optimal strategy for both players.
- It only checks if a number is missing or if it appears exactly once, but it does not ensure that Alice and Bob are making the best possible moves to achieve their respective goals.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed to simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
