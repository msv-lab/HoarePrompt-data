Output State: **The loop has processed all the test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the smallest integer that is not present in the list `arr` or the smallest integer that appears exactly once after the first integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` are reset for each test case, and `mpp` and `first` are updated within each iteration of the test case loop. After the loop finishes, the values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` are undefined, but the overall state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding outputs have been printed.**
