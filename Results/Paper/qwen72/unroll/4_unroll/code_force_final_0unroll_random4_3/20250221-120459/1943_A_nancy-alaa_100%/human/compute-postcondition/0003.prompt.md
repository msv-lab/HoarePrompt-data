You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. Additionally, the function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, each defined by the integer `t` and the list `a` of size `n` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 0 ≤ a_i < n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: The loop has processed all the test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the smallest integer that is not present in the list `arr` or the smallest integer that appears exactly once after the first integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` are reset for each test case, and `mpp` and `first` are updated within each iteration of the test case loop. After the loop finishes, the values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` are undefined, but the overall state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding outputs have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list. It processes the list `a` and returns a result for each test case, where the number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 2 · 10^4, the size of the list `n` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5, and each element in the list `a` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
