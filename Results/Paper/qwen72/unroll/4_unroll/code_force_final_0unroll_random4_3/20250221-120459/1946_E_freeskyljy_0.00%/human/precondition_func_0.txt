The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it should take parameters `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `p`, and `s` where `n` is the length of the permutation, `m_1` and `m_2` are the number of prefix and suffix maximums respectively, `p` is a list of indices of prefix maximums in increasing order, and `s` is a list of indices of suffix maximums in increasing order. Additionally, `1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
