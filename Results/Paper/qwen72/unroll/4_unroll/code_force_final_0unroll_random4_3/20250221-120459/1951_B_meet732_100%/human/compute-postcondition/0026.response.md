Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of distinct integers and an index `k` (which is not explicitly passed as a parameter but is used within the function). It returns an integer based on the indices of elements in `a` that are greater than `a[k]`. If there are no elements in `a` greater than `a[k]`, it returns `n - 1` (where `n` is the length of the list `a`). If there is exactly one element greater than `a[k]`, it returns the index of that element minus 1, or a value based on the position of `k` relative to that index. If there are two or more elements greater than `a[k]`, it returns a value based on the indices of the first two such elements and the position of `k` relative to them. **
