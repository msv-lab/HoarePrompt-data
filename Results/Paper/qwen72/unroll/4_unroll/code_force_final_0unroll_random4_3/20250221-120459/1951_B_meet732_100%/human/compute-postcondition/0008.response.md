Postcondition: **`ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and `c` is 2. If there are less than two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, `ind` will contain the indices of all such elements, and `c` will be the number of such elements. All other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list.**
