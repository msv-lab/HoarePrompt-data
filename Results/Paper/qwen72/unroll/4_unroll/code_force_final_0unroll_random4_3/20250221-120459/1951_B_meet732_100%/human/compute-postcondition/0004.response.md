Output State: `a` remains unchanged; `x` remains equal to `a[k]`; `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`; `c` is 2. If there are fewer than two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, `ind` will contain the indices of those elements, and `c` will be the number of such elements. If there are no elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, `ind` will remain empty, and `c` will be 0.
