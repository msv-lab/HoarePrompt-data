### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `todo` is a set containing the elements of array `b`.
   - `done` is a set that will keep track of elements from `a` that match elements in `b` and are part of the current subsegment.
   - `extra` is a set that will keep track of elements from `a` that are not in `b` and are part of the current subsegment.

3. **First Subsegment**:
   - The program iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and updates the `todo`, `done`, and `extra` sets accordingly.
   - If an element from `a` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - If an element from `a` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.

4. **Counting Good Subsegments**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1 if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`, otherwise it initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new element `a[r]`, it updates the sets by removing the element `a[r-m]` (the element that is no longer part of the current subsegment) and adding the new element `a[r]`.
   - If the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`, it increments `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments for a test case, the program prints the value of `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the initialization of the first subsegment.
- It correctly updates the sets as it slides the window over the array `a`.
- The logic for counting good subsegments is sound and follows the problem description.

### Potential Issues:
- The program uses sets for `todo`, `done`, and `extra`, which is efficient for the operations it performs (add, remove, and check membership).
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where the subsegment length `m` is equal to `n` or `k` is equal to `m`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the logic it implements.

### Correctness:
**True**
