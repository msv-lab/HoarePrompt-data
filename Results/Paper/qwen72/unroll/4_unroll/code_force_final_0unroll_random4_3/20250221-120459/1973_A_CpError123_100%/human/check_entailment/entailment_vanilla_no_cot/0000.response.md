Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Total Points Calculation**: The total points of all players combined should be an even number because each game (whether it ends in a win/loss or a draw) contributes an even number of points (2 points for a win/loss and 2 points for a draw).

2. **Draw Calculation**: The program calculates `x` as half of the total points and `y` as the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores. However, this does not necessarily give the correct maximum number of draws.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - The total number of games played can be calculated as `(a + b + c) // 2`.
   - The number of draws can be calculated by considering the maximum number of draws that can be consistent with the given scores. The maximum number of draws is the minimum of the total number of games and the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores divided by 2.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = a + b + c
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_games = total_points // 2
        max_draws = min(total_games, (a + b) // 2)
        print(max_draws)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the total number of games is correctly calculated and that the maximum number of draws is consistent with the given scores.
