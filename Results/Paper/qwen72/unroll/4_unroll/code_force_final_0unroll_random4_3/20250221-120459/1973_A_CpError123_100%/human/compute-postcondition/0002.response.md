Output State: **The loop processes `t` test cases, each defined by a different set of integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `x` as half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `y` as the sum of `a` and `b`, then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged, but the loop has printed the results for each test case.**
