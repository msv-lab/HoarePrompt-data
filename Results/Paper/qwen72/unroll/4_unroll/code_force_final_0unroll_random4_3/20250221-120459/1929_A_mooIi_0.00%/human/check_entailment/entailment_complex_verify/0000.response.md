Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. Instead of calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), the program sorts the array and prints the sorted elements. This behavior is clearly evident from the annotated code and the example provided in the original assessment.

The program should compute the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging the elements to maximize the sum of differences. Sorting the array in non-decreasing order and then computing the sum of differences would not necessarily yield the maximum beauty. For example, in the case where the input array is `[2, 1, 3]`, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3]`, and the sum of differences is \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\). However, the program simply prints the sorted array, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.
2. Compute the sum of differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

However, the current program only performs the first step and fails to compute the sum of differences. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

Final: **False**
