Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted elements. This does not meet the requirement of calculating the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  2 1 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1 2 3
  ```

The program should compute the maximum beauty, which in this case is 2, but it instead prints the sorted array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
