The loop head involves the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
