Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), after rearranging the elements of the array in any way. However, the program simply sorts the array and prints it, which does not compute the maximum beauty.

To solve the problem correctly, you should sort the array in ascending order and then compute the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array in descending order and then computing the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort in descending order
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.
