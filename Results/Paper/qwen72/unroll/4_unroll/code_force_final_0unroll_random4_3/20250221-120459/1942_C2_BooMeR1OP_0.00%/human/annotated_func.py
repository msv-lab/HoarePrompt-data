#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen. For example: `def func_1(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5) representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func_1():
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    a.sort()
    present = set(a)
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        
        if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `n`, `x`, `y`, `t`, `chosen_vertices`, `a`, and `present` remain unchanged. `ans` is incremented by the number of times the condition `(a[i] + 1) % n not in present and (a[i] + 2) % n in present` is true for all `i` from 0 to `x - 1`.
    gaps = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
        
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        
        if gap > 0:
            gaps.append(gap)
        
    #State: Output State: `n`, `x`, `y`, `t`, `chosen_vertices`, `a`, and `present` remain unchanged. `ans` is incremented by the number of times the condition `(a[i] + 1) % n not in present and (a[i] + 2) % n in present` is true for all `i` from 0 to `x - 1`. `gaps` is a list containing the positive differences between consecutive elements in `a` (with the last element considering the wrap-around if `i == x - 1`), where each difference is `next_elem - a[i] - 1` and `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + n` if `i == x - 1` and `a[(i + 1) % x]` otherwise.
    gaps.sort()
    for gap in gaps:
        pairs = gap // 2
        
        if y >= pairs:
            ans += gap
            y -= pairs
        else:
            ans += 2 * y
            break
        
    #State: `n`, `x`, `y` remain unchanged. `t`, `chosen_vertices`, `a`, and `present` remain unchanged. `ans` is incremented by the sum of all `gap` values in `gaps` that are fully consumed by the loop (i.e., `y >= pairs`), plus `2 * y` for the last partial consumption of `gap` (if any).
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of all fully consumed gap values in gaps plus 2 * y for the last partial consumption of gap, if any)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values for `n`, `x`, and `y` from the user, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It then calculates the number of additional vertices that can be chosen to form a convex polygon with Bessie's chosen vertices, under the constraint that at most `y` additional vertices can be selected. The function prints the total number of ways to choose these additional vertices. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the unchanged values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of chosen vertices, along with the calculated and printed value of `ans`.
