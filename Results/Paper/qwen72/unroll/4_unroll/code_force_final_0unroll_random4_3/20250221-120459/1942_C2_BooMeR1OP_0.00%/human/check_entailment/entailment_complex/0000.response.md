Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take parameters for the number of sides `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose `y`, and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen `a`.
   - The function reads input values inside the loop, which is a common practice for competitive programming problems, but it should be noted that the function definition is incomplete.

2. **Initial Calculation of `ans`:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is correct because any set of `x` vertices in a polygon can form at least `x - 2` triangles by connecting them with diagonals.

3. **Handling Gaps:**
   - The function calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices, considering the wrap-around for the last vertex. This is done correctly by using modulo arithmetic and checking the condition for the last element.
   - The gaps are stored in a list and sorted. This is a good approach to ensure that the smallest gaps are considered first, which helps in maximizing the number of triangles formed.

4. **Incrementing `ans` Based on Gaps:**
   - The function iterates over the sorted gaps and calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added within each gap. This is done by `gap // 2`.
   - If the number of pairs that can be added is less than or equal to `y`, it adds the entire gap to `ans` and decrements `y` by the number of pairs.
   - If `y` is less than the number of pairs, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and breaks the loop. This ensures that the maximum number of triangles is formed without exceeding the limit on additional vertices.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the final value of `ans`, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

Given the above reasoning, the function logic is correct and follows the problem description. However, the function definition is incomplete and should be fixed to include parameters. Despite this, the function will work correctly for the given problem when called with the appropriate parameters.

Correctness: **True**

However, to fully adhere to the problem description, the function should be defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):
    a = [(num - 1) for num in chosen_vertices]
    a.sort()
    present = set(a)
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
            ans += 1
    
    gaps = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        if gap > 0:
            gaps.append(gap)
    
    gaps.sort()
    for gap in gaps:
        pairs = gap // 2
        if y >= pairs:
            ans += gap
            y -= pairs
        else:
            ans += 2 * y
            break
    
    print(ans)
```

And the main program should call this function with the appropriate parameters:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        chosen_vertices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        func_1(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices)
```

This would ensure that the function is correctly defined and called, making the program fully compliant with the problem description.
