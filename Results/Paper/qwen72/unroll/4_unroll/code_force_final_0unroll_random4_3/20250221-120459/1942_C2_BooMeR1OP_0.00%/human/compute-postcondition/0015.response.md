To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `x`, `y` remain unchanged.
- `t`, `chosen_vertices`, `a`, and `present` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is incremented by the sum of all `gap` values in `gaps` that are fully consumed by the loop (i.e., `y >= pairs`), plus `2 * y` for the last partial consumption of `gap` (if any).

### Explanation:
1. **`gaps` List**: This list contains values that represent gaps. Each gap value is a number that can be consumed by the loop.
2. **Loop Consumption**: The loop consumes gaps in the list `gaps` until `y` is less than the number of pairs in the current gap. If `y` is greater than or equal to the number of pairs in the current gap, the gap is fully consumed, and `y` is decremented by the number of pairs. If `y` is less than the number of pairs in the current gap, the gap is partially consumed, and `y` is set to 0.
3. **Incrementing `ans`**:
   - For each fully consumed gap, the value of the gap is added to `ans`.
   - For the last partial consumption, `2 * y` is added to `ans`.

### Calculation:
- **Fully Consumed Gaps**: Sum all the `gap` values in `gaps` that are fully consumed by the loop.
- **Partial Consumption**: If there is a partial consumption of the last gap, add `2 * y` to `ans`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` after it has been incremented by the sum of all fully consumed `gap` values and `2 * y` for the last partial consumption (if any).

Since the exact values of `gaps` and `y` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of all fully consumed gap values in gaps plus 2 * y for the last partial consumption of gap, if any)**
