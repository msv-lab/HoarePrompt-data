The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, representing the number of sides of the polygon.
- `x`: an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.
- `y`: an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.
- `chosen_vertices`: a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

The function returns the number of ways to choose up to `y` additional vertices from the remaining vertices of the polygon, such that the chosen vertices (including Bessie's vertices) form a convex polygon.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. It returns the number of ways to choose up to `y` additional vertices from the remaining vertices of an `n`-sided polygon, such that the chosen vertices (including Bessie's `x` chosen vertices) form a convex polygon.**
