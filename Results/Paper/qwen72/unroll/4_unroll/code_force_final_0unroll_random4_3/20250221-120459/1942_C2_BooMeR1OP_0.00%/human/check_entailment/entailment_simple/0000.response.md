### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined without parameters, but it reads the input inside the function. This is not ideal for reusability and testing, but it does not affect the correctness of the program for the given problem.
   - The input is read correctly using `map(int, input().split())` and `list(map(int, input().split()))` to get the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of chosen vertices `a`.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are adjusted to be 0-indexed by subtracting 1 from each element in `a`.
   - The set `present` is created to keep track of the chosen vertices for quick lookup.
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices in a polygon can form at least `x - 2` triangles by connecting them with non-intersecting diagonals.

3. **Incrementing `ans` for Immediate Triangles:**
   - The loop iterates over each chosen vertex and checks if the next vertex (i.e., `(a[i] + 1) % n`) is not in `present` and the vertex after that (i.e., `(a[i] + 2) % n`) is in `present`.
   - If this condition is true, it means we can form an additional triangle by adding the next vertex, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - This part of the code correctly identifies and counts the immediate triangles that can be formed.

4. **Calculating Gaps:**
   - The `gaps` list is created to store the number of vertices between each pair of chosen vertices (considering wrap-around for the last vertex).
   - The gaps are calculated correctly using `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, where `next_elem` is adjusted for wrap-around if `i == x - 1`.

5. **Maximizing Triangles by Choosing Additional Vertices:**
   - The gaps are sorted in ascending order.
   - The loop iterates over each gap and calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added within that gap.
   - If `y` (the number of additional vertices you can choose) is greater than or equal to the number of pairs, `ans` is incremented by the gap size, and `y` is decremented by the number of pairs.
   - If `y` is less than the number of pairs, `ans` is incremented by `2 * y` (since each additional vertex can form at most 2 new triangles), and the loop breaks.
   - This part of the code correctly maximizes the number of triangles by choosing the most beneficial gaps first.

6. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, which represents the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Correctness:
The program correctly follows the problem description and logic to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake. The initial setup, gap calculation, and the process of choosing additional vertices are all implemented correctly.

**Correctness: True**
