Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `d` and `e` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. The function then processes these strings to find the longest prefix of `d` that is a substring of `e`, and prints the length of this prefix. The state of `t` remains unchanged, but the values of `n`, `m`, `d`, and `e` are updated for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
