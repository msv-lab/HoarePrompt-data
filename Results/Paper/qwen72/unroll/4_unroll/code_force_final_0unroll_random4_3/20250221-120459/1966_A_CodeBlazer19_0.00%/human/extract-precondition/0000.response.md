Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `numbers` representing the numbers on the cards, and an integer `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 100) representing the number of cards to be exchanged in each operation. The list `numbers` should have a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and each element `c_i` in `numbers` should be an integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100).**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be:

```python
def min_cards_left(numbers, k):
```

With the correct function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers with length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and each element c_i (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100), and k is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 100).**
