Reasoning:  
The provided function `func` is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. The function simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations.

The problem requires calculating the minimum number of cards that can remain after repeatedly exchanging `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards of any number. The function should count the frequency of each number in the list `l` and then determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be exchanged, which would be the remainder of the total number of cards after repeatedly performing the exchange operation.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:
1. For each test case, count the frequency of each number in the list `l`.
2. For each frequency, calculate the number of cards that cannot be exchanged. This can be done by taking the remainder of the frequency when divided by `k`.
3. Sum these remainders to get the total number of cards that cannot be exchanged, which is the minimum number of cards left.

The function provided does not perform any of these steps and instead prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
