Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. If `0` is in the set `ans`, `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations, excluding the value `0`, and `n` is added to the set `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations.***
