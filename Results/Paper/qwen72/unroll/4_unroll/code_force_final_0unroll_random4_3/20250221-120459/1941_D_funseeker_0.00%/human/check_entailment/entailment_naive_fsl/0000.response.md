Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly handles all the requirements specified in the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. It reads the number of players, the number of throws, and the starting player correctly.

2. **Throw Processing**: For each throw, the program correctly updates the set of possible players who could have the ball. It considers both clockwise and counterclockwise throws when the direction is unknown ('?') and only the specified direction when known ('0' or '1').

3. **Modulo Operation**: The program uses modulo operations to handle the circular nature of the game, ensuring that the player numbers wrap around correctly.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the number of possible players and the players themselves in increasing order. It also correctly handles the edge case where the player number might be 0 (which should be converted to n).

The program appears to handle all edge cases and potential inputs correctly, and I cannot find a case where it fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
