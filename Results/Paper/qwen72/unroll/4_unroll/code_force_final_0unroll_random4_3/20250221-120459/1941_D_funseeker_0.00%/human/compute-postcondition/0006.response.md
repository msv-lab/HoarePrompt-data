Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations, excluding the value 0, and `n` is added to the set `ans`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is added to the set `ans`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged. The set `ans` still contains all the values it had before, plus the value `n`.
