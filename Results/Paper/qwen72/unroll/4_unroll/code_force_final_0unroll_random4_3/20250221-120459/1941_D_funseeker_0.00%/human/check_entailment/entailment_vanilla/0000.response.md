### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines and `int()` to convert them to integers.
   - `func_3()` reads a line and splits it into integers, which is used to get the values of `n`, `m`, and `x`.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible players who could have the ball after each throw.

3. **Processing Each Throw**:
   - For each of the `m` throws, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible new positions of the ball.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. This represents a clockwise throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. This represents a counterclockwise throw.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.

4. **Adjusting for Player Numbering**:
   - The players are numbered from 1 to `n`, but the modulo operation results in values from 0 to `n-1`.
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and, if so, removes it and adds `n` to the set to adjust for the player numbering.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of players in the set `ans`.
   - It then prints the players in the set `ans` in increasing order.

### Analysis:
- **Modulo Operation**:
  - The use of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` is correct for handling circular movements. However, for counterclockwise movement, `(q - r) % n` might result in a negative value, which should be adjusted to a positive value by adding `n` if necessary.
  - The program should use `(q - r) % n` and then adjust it to `((q - r) % n + n) % n` to ensure the result is always non-negative.

- **Set Operations**:
  - The set `ans` is used to keep track of all possible positions of the ball. This is a good approach to avoid duplicate positions and ensure all possible outcomes are considered.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where the ball could be with player `n` by adjusting the set after the modulo operation.

### Correctness:
- The program is almost correct, but it needs a small adjustment to handle the counterclockwise movement properly. Specifically, the line `temp.add((q - r) % n)` should be changed to `temp.add(((q - r) % n + n) % n)` to ensure the result is always a valid player number.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

# Function 1:
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

# Function 3:
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

# Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add(((q - r) % n + n) % n)  # Adjust for counterclockwise movement
        ans = temp
    if 0 in ans:
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))  # Ensure the output is in increasing order

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    t = func_2()
    for _ in range(t):
        func_4()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Final Correctness:
- After making the necessary adjustment for counterclockwise movement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
