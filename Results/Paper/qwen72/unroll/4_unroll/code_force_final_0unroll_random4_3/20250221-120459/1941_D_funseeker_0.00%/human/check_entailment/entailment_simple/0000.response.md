### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1()` to read lines of input. This function reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. It is used to read the number of test cases and the details of each throw.
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases and returns it as an integer.
   - `func_3()` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part to an integer. This function is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - The main logic is in `func_4()`, which simulates the game for each test case.
   - The initial set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction `c`, the program updates the set `ans` to include the possible positions of the ball after the throw. If the direction is unknown (`?`), both clockwise and counterclockwise positions are considered.
   - The positions are calculated using `(q + r) % n` for clockwise and `(q - r) % n` for counterclockwise. This ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly.

3. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it is replaced with `n` because the players are numbered from `1` to `n`.
   - The program then prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and the list of these players.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the ball could be with player `n` (which is represented as `0` in the set `ans` due to modulo operation).
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown (`?`), considering both possible directions.

5. **Performance**:
   - The program uses a set to keep track of possible positions, which is efficient for this problem since the number of players and throws is limited.
   - The use of `lru_cache` is not necessary in this program and is not used, so it can be ignored.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly simulates the game and outputs the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. It handles all the specified cases and constraints correctly.

**Correctness: **True****
