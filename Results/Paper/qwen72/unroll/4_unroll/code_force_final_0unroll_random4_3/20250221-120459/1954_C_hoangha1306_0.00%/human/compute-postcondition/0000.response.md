The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and they still must be integers within the specified range (1 <= x, y < 10^100) and consist only of digits from 1 to 9.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.**
