You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` from input, each containing digits from 1 to 9. It then constructs two new strings `kq1` and `kq2` by comparing the corresponding digits of `a` and `b`. If the digits are the same, they are added to both `kq1` and `kq2`. If the digits are different, the smaller digit is added to `kq1` and the larger digit is added to `kq2` for the first difference encountered, and then the larger digit is added to `kq1` and the smaller digit is added to `kq2` for all subsequent differences. The function prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each test case. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` representing the integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes two empty strings `kq1` and `kq2` to store the results after the operations.
   - It also initializes a variable `vt` to 0, which is used to track the first swap.

3. **Digit Comparison and Swapping:**
   - The program iterates over each digit of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If the digits at the current position are the same, it appends them to both `kq1` and `kq2` without any change.
   - If the digits are different, it determines the smaller and larger digit using `min` and `max` functions.
   - If `vt` is 0 (indicating the first swap), it checks which digit is larger and appends the smaller digit to `kq1` and the larger digit to `kq2` if `a[i] > b[i]`, and vice versa if `a[i] < b[i]`.
   - If `vt` is 1 (indicating subsequent swaps), it always appends the larger digit to `kq1` and the smaller digit to `kq2`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all digits, it prints the resulting strings `kq1` and `kq2`.

### Analysis:

- **Objective:**
  - The goal is to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping digits at the same positions any number of times.

- **Logic:**
  - The program's logic is to ensure that the larger digit is always placed in the number that will benefit the most from it. This is achieved by:
    - Initially, if the digits are different, it decides which number should get the larger digit based on the current state.
    - After the first swap, it consistently places the larger digit in `kq1` and the smaller digit in `kq2`.

- **Correctness:**
  - The program correctly identifies and swaps the digits to maximize the product.
  - It handles the case where digits are the same by leaving them unchanged.
  - It ensures that the resulting numbers are valid integers and maximizes the product by placing the larger digits in the appropriate positions.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `73` and `31`
  - Output: `71` and `33`
  - Explanation: Swapping the second digits results in `71` and `33`, which maximizes the product.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `2` and `5`
  - Output: `5` and `2`
  - Explanation: Swapping the digits results in `5` and `2`, which maximizes the product.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3516` and `3982`
  - Output: `3912` and `3586`
  - Explanation: Swapping the second and fourth digits results in `3912` and `3586`, which maximizes the product.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping digits at the same positions. It handles all the given constraints and examples correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
