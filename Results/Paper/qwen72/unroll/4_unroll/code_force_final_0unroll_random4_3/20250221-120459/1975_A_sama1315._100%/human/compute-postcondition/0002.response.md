Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is 0.**

The variable `idx` is initialized to 0, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `data`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
