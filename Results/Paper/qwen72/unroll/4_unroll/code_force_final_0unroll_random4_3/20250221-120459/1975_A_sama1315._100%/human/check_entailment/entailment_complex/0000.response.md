### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of positive integers and checks if it can be transformed into a non-decreasing sorted array by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix).
   - It first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
   - The function iterates over the possible starting points `i` in `concatenated_a` and checks if the subsequence starting at `i` and of length `n` (the length of `a`) matches `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subsequence is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by performing the operation.
   - If no such subsequence is found after all iterations, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to handle multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an index `idx` to keep track of the current position in the input data.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - It calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result on a new line.

### Analysis:
- **Function 1**:
  - The logic of checking if the sorted version of `a` is a contiguous subsequence of `a + a` is correct. This is because if the sorted version of `a` can be obtained by splitting and swapping `a`, it must appear as a contiguous subsequence in `a + a`.
  - The function correctly handles the edge cases and returns 'Yes' or 'No' based on the presence of the sorted subsequence.

- **Function 2**:
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
  - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
  - The results are printed in the correct format, with each result on a new line.

### Conclusion:
The program as a whole correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted by performing the specified operation. Both functions work together to handle the input and produce the correct output for each test case.
