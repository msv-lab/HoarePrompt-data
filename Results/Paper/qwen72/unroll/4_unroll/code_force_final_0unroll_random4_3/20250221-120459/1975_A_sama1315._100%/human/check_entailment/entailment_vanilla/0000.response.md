### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix, and then swapping these parts.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - **Input:** The function `func_1` takes an array `a` as input.
   - **Output:** It returns "Yes" if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the operation, and "No" otherwise.
   - **Logic:**
     - The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
     - It then creates a concatenated array `concatenated_a` by appending `a` to itself.
     - It iterates through the concatenated array and checks if any subarray of length `n` (the length of the original array) is equal to the sorted array `sorted_a`.
     - If such a subarray is found, it returns "Yes".
     - If no such subarray is found after the loop, it returns "No".

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - **Input:** The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - **Output:** It prints the results for each test case.
   - **Logic:**
     - It reads the input as a single string and splits it into a list of strings.
     - It initializes an index `idx` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
     - It calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Correctness of Function 1:**
   - The logic of `func_1` is correct. By creating a concatenated array `a + a`, we can check if any cyclic permutation of the array `a` is equal to the sorted array `sorted_a`.
   - This is because if the array can be split and swapped to become sorted, the sorted array will appear as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array.
   - The function correctly checks all possible subarrays of length `n` in the concatenated array.

5. **Correctness of Function 2:**
   - The logic of `func_2` is also correct. It reads the input efficiently and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - The use of `sys.stdin.read` and splitting the input into a list of strings is a common and efficient way to handle multiple test cases in competitive programming.
   - The function correctly handles the index and reads the input for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Both `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented to solve the given problem. The program will correctly determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation.

**Correctness: True**
