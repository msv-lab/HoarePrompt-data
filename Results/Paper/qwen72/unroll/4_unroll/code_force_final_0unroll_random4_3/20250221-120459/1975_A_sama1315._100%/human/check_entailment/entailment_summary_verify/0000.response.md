### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Purpose**: To determine if the array `a` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified swap operation.
   - **Approach**: The function concatenates the array `a` with itself (`a + a`) and then checks if any subarray of length `n` (the length of the original array) in this concatenated array matches the sorted version of the original array.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The approach is based on the observation that if the array can be split into two parts and swapped to become sorted, then the sorted array must appear as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array `a + a`.
     - This is because the operation of splitting and swapping the array can be thought of as a circular shift. If a circular shift of the array results in a sorted array, then the sorted array will appear as a subarray in `a + a`.
     - The function correctly checks all possible subarrays of length `n` in `a + a` to see if any of them match the sorted version of `a`.
     - If such a subarray is found, the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases by reading input from `sys.stdin`, processing each test case using `func_1`, and printing the results.
   - **Approach**:
     - The function reads all input data at once and splits it into a list of strings.
     - It then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the list of integers `a` from the input data.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the list `a` and collects the results.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case as described in the problem statement.
     - It uses the `func_1` function to determine if the array can be sorted for each test case.
     - The results are collected in a list and printed at the end, which is consistent with the problem's output requirements.

### Evaluation:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - The function `func_1` is logically sound and correctly implements the required check. It effectively uses the concatenated array to simulate all possible circular shifts and checks for the sorted condition.
  - No issues were found in the logic or the implementation.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - The function `func_2` correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
  - It reads the input efficiently and processes each test case using `func_1`.
  - The results are printed in the correct format as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is accurate. Both functions work as expected and correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final:
**True**
