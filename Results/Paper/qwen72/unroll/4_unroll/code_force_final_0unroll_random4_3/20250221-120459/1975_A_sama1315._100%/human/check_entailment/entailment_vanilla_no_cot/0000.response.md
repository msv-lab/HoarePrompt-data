Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if the array `a` can be transformed into a non-decreasing sorted array by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix).
   - It first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates the array `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`. This is a common technique to handle circular shifts or splits and swaps.
   - It iterates through the concatenated array to check if any subarray of length `n` (the length of the original array) matches the sorted array `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an index `idx` to keep track of the current position in the input data.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the problem by checking if any circular shift of the array can result in a sorted array. The input handling in `func_2` is also correct and follows the problem's input format. Therefore, the program is correct.
