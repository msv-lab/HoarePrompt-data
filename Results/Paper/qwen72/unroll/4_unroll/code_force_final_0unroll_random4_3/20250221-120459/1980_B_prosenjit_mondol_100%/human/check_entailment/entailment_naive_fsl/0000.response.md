Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the favorite cube will be removed. Specifically, the condition `if a[k] > x:` is incorrect. It should be checking if the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes after sorting, not just if the value at position `k` is greater than the value of the favorite cube.

Here's a counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 2 2
  4 3 3 2 3
  ```
- Expected Output: "MAYBE"
- Actual Output: "NO"

In this case, the favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3. After sorting the array in non-increasing order, the array becomes `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The first `k` (2) cubes are `[4, 3]`. The favorite cube could be in the second position, which means it would be removed, or it could be in the third position, which means it would not be removed. Therefore, the correct output should be "MAYBE", but the program incorrectly outputs "NO".
