Output State: **t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n remains an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, p remains a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct. The loop prints either 2 or 3 for each iteration of the outer loop, depending on the condition inside the inner loop.**
