You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n remains an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, p remains a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. The loop prints either 2 or 3 for each iteration of the outer loop, depending on the condition inside the inner loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `x` and the list of best friends `l`.

2. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends**: The program checks if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. This is done by iterating over the list `l` and checking if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If this condition is true for any `i`, it means that friend `i + 1` and friend `l[i]` are mutual best friends.

3. **Output for Mutual Best Friends**: If a pair of mutual best friends is found, the program prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. This is correct because if there is a pair of mutual best friends, Monocarp only needs to send invitations to these two friends to ensure that both come to the party.

4. **Output for No Mutual Best Friends**: If no pair of mutual best friends is found, the program prints `3`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the minimum number of invitations needed is always `3` when there are no mutual best friends. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, if the best friend relationships form a cycle of length greater than 2, Monocarp might need to send more than 3 invitations to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

5. **Handling Cycles**: The program does not handle cycles in the best friend relationships. For instance, if `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, this forms a cycle of length 4. In such cases, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. The program fails to account for this scenario and always prints `3` when no mutual best friends are found.

6. **General Case**: The program does not consider the general case where the best friend relationships might form multiple cycles or chains. The correct approach would be to identify the smallest cycle or chain that can ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases of best friend relationships, especially cycles of length greater than 2.
