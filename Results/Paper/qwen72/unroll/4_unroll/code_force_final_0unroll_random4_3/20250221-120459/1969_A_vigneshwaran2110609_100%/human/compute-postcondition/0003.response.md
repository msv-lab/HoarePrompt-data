The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` â‰  `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct.

The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each between 1 and `n` and not equal to its index. The function returns a result based on these parameters.**
