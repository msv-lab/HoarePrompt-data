Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of the array, `n` is also the length of the array.**

In natural language, the initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `n` is now explicitly assigned the value of the length of the array, which is the same as the `n` mentioned in the initial state.
