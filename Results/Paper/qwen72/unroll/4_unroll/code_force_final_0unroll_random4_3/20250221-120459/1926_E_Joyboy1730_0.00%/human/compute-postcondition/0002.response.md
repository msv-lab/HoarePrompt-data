Output State: **The loop reads `t` pairs of integers `(n, k)` from the input, and for each pair, it prints a value calculated based on the given logic. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged, but the internal variables `L`, `tot`, `pow`, and `a` are reset or modified within each iteration of the loop.**

To break it down:
- `t` remains the same as it was initially.
- `n` and `k` are reset to the values read from the input for each iteration of the outer loop.
- `L` is an empty list after each iteration of the outer loop.
- `tot` and `pow` are reset to 0 and 1, respectively, at the start of each iteration of the outer loop.
- `a` is a variable that is used within the inner loop and is not retained between iterations.

The key output is the value printed for each pair `(n, k)`, which is calculated as `pow * (2 * k - 1)` when the condition `tot < k and k <= tot + a` is met.
