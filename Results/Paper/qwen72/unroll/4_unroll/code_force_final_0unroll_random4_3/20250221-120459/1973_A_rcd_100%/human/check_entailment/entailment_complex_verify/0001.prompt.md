You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order.

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input, and print a result based on the conditions provided in the loop body. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the initial state will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the input, representing the scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order. It then prints a result based on the following conditions: if the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1`. If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1` and `p2`, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, it adjusts the scores by decrementing `p3` and incrementing `p1` until a condition is met, and prints the adjusted sum of `p1` and `p3`. If the loop completes without meeting the condition, it prints `p3`. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not modified outside the loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Check for Validity of Scores**:
   - The total score `(p1 + p2 + p3)` must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw).
   - If the total score is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.

3. **Determine Maximum Draws**:
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because all games could have ended in draws.
   - Otherwise, the function attempts to find the maximum number of draws by adjusting the scores of the players.

4. **Algorithm for Finding Draws**:
   - The function initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively.
   - It then enters a loop where it checks if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.
   - If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid condition, it prints `p3`.

### Analysis:

- **Total Score Check**:
  - This is a necessary condition to ensure the scores are consistent with the rules of the game. If the total score is odd, it is impossible to achieve the scores with the given rules, so `-1` is printed correctly.

- **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
  - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because all games could have ended in draws, and the highest score `p3` could be the sum of the draws.
  - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the function tries to find a valid distribution of draws and wins that matches the scores. The loop adjusts the scores by decrementing `y` and incrementing `x` until a valid condition is met or the loop completes.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the case where no games were played (`0 0 0`) correctly by printing `0`.
  - It also handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (`1 1 10`) correctly by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly checks the validity of the scores and calculates the maximum number of draws for each test case. The logic and conditions used are consistent with the problem description.
