### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Check for Validity of Scores**:
   - The total score `(p1 + p2 + p3)` must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw).
   - If the total score is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.

3. **Determine Maximum Draws**:
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`), the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because all games could have ended in draws.
   - Otherwise, the function attempts to find the maximum number of draws by adjusting the scores of the players.

4. **Algorithm for Finding Draws**:
   - The function initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively.
   - It then enters a loop where it checks if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.
   - If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid condition, it prints `p3`.

### Analysis:

- **Total Score Check**:
  - This is a necessary condition to ensure the scores are consistent with the rules of the game. If the total score is odd, it is impossible to achieve the scores with the given rules, so `-1` is printed correctly.

- **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
  - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because all games could have ended in draws, and the highest score `p3` could be the sum of the draws.
  - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the function tries to find a valid distribution of draws and wins that matches the scores. The loop adjusts the scores by decrementing `y` and incrementing `x` until a valid condition is met or the loop completes.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the case where no games were played (`0 0 0`) correctly by printing `0`.
  - It also handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (`1 1 10`) correctly by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly checks the validity of the scores and calculates the maximum number of draws for each test case. The logic and conditions used are consistent with the problem description.
