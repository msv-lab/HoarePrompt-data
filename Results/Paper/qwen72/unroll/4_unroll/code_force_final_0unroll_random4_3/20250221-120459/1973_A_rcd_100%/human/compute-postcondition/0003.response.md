The function `func` accepts three parameters `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. These parameters are integers where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns a string indicating the outcome based on the scores, but the specific conditions for the return values are not provided in the given information.
