Output State: **The loop will execute `n` times, and for each iteration, it will read two integers `a` and `b` from the input. If both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one is exactly half of the other, it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will print 'YES'. The values of `a` and `b` will be updated with each iteration, but the value of `n` will remain unchanged.**
