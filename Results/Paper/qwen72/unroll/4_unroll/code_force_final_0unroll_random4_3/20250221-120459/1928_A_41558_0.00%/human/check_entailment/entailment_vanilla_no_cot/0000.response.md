Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the conditions used to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. Specifically, the condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is incorrect. This condition checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other, but this is not a valid criterion for determining whether another rectangle can be formed.

To correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle, we need to check if at least one of the dimensions is even. If both dimensions are odd, then cutting the rectangle will always result in smaller rectangles that cannot form a new rectangle different from the original one (considering the 90-degree rotation).

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

This program correctly checks if at least one of the dimensions is even, and if so, it prints "YES". If both dimensions are odd, it prints "NO". This aligns with the problem description and the provided examples.
