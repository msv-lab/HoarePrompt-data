You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `n` test cases, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, which represent the dimensions of a rectangle. It then checks if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one is exactly half of the other. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values `a` and `b` for each test case are processed, and the program state is unchanged except for the output printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting an odd-sized side will always result in two rectangles with at least one odd side, and combining them will not form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. The key is to check if the resulting rectangles can form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

3. **Checking for New Rectangle**:
   - If \(a\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(a/2 \times b\) rectangles. These can be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(a/2 \times 2b\), which is different from the original if \(a/2 \neq b\).
   - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(a \times b/2\) rectangles. These can be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(2a \times b/2\), which is different from the original if \(a \neq b/2\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), Bob cannot form a new rectangle because there is no way to cut a 1x1 rectangle.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting a 2x1 rectangle results in two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, both of which are the same as the original.

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(n\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If so, it prints "NO" because no new rectangle can be formed.
   - It checks if \(a / 2 == b\) or \(b / 2 == a\). If either condition is true, it prints "NO" because the resulting rectangle would be the same as the original.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" because a new rectangle can be formed.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the resulting rectangle is the same as the original.
   - The program correctly prints "YES" for all other cases where a new rectangle can be formed.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the reasoning provided.

Correctness: **True**
