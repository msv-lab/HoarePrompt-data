Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where one of the dimensions is 1 and the other is an even number. According to the problem description, a rectangle of size 2 \times 1 cannot be used to form another rectangle, but the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" for such cases. For example, if the input is `2 1`, the program should output "No" but it outputs "Yes".
