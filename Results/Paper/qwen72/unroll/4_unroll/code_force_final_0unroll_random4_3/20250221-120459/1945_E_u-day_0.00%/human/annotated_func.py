#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that yields integer values from the input provided, where the input is split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an iterator that yields integer values from the input provided, where the input is split by spaces. The function assumes that the input is a string of space-separated values that can be converted to integers. After the function concludes, the iterator is ready to be used to retrieve the integer values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, so there is no precondition to specify.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the initial state, the exact contents of the list cannot be determined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`. The exact contents of the list are not specified as `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code.
