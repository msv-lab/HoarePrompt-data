Output State: **`pos` is the index of the element `k` in the list `arr` if `k` is present in `arr`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`. `st` is an empty set.** 

The code initializes an empty set `st`, but does not change the values of `pos`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid, with the addition that `st` is now an empty set.
