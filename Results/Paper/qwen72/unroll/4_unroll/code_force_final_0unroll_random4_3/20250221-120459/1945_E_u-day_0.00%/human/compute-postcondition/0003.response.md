The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()`. However, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and starts at 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1**
