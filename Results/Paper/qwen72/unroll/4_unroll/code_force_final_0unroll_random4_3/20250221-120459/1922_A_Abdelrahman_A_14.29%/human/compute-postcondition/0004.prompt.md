You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take four parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `tests` times, and for each test case, it will read `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if any character in `c` is not present in either `a` or `b`, it will print 'NO' or 'YES' respectively. After all iterations, the variables `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be in their final states corresponding to the last test case, and the variable `no` will be `True` if the last test case did not print 'YES', otherwise it will be `False`. The variable `tests` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result for each test case based on the input strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
