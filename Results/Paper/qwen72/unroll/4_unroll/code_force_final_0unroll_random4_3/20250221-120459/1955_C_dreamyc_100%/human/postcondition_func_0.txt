The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `nums`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates two thresholds: `a` (the ceiling of `k / 2`) and `b` (the integer division of `k` by 2). The function then returns the total count of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` when counted from the start of the list, plus the count of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` when counted from the end of the list. The original values of `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
