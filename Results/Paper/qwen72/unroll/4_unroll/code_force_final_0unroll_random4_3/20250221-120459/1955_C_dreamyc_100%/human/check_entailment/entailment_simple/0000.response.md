### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check:**
   - The function `func_1` starts by checking if `k` (the number of attacks) is greater than or equal to the sum of all the durabilities in `nums`. If this is the case, it returns `n`, which is the total number of ships. This is correct because if the Kraken attacks more times than the total durability of all ships, all ships will sink.

2. **Attack Calculation:**
   - The function then calculates `a` and `b`:
     - `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2`, which represents the number of attacks on the first ship (or the first remaining ship) in the sequence.
     - `b` is the integer division of `k` by 2, which represents the number of attacks on the last ship (or the last remaining ship) in the sequence.
   - This is a reasonable approach because the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships.

3. **Loop to Count Sunk Ships:**
   - The function iterates through the list `nums` to count how many ships are sunk:
     - For each ship `i`, it adds the durability of the ship to `s_a` and `s_b`.
     - It checks if `s_a` (the sum of the durabilities of the first `i+1` ships) is less than or equal to `a`. If so, it increments `ans` by 1, indicating that the first `i+1` ships have been attacked enough times to potentially sink.
     - It checks if `s_b` (the sum of the durabilities of the last `i+1` ships) is less than or equal to `b`. If so, it increments `ans` by 1, indicating that the last `i+1` ships have been attacked enough times to potentially sink.
   - However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the alternating nature of the attacks. The function should track the number of attacks on the first and last ships separately and ensure that a ship is not counted as sunk more than once.

4. **Output:**
   - The function returns `ans`, which is the number of ships that are less than or equal to `a` plus the number of ships that are less than or equal to `b` when counted from the end of the list. This is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the alternating attacks and can lead to overcounting of ships.

### Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks by the Kraken and can overcount the number of ships that are sunk. The logic for counting the number of sunk ships is flawed, and it does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.
