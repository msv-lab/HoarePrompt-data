def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains the integer values of the input provided by the user, split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns a map object containing the integer values of the user input, split by spaces. The map object can be iterated over to access the individual integer values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are used in the function signature.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from the input provided by the user, where the input is split into separate strings and each string is converted to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers derived from user input. The input is expected to be a string of space-separated values, each of which is converted to an integer. The function does not modify any external state or variables.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a positive integer `n` and a value `v` of any type. It returns a list containing `n` elements, where each element is `v`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that a new list has been created and returned, with each element being a copy of `v`.

    #The program returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of the value `v`, and there are `n` such inner lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `v`. It returns a list containing `n` inner lists, each of which contains `m` occurrences of the value `v`. The function does not modify the input parameters. After the function concludes, the program state is unchanged except for the returned value.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two integers, `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of sides of a polygon and `m` is the number of edges or connections to be added, with constraints 4 <= n <= 10^9 and 0 <= m <= n.
