### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This is a crucial step because Alice will remove the largest elements to maximize the sum, and Bob will multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - `ans1` is initialized to the sum of the array `a`.
   - Bob's operation is simulated by subtracting twice the value of the first `x` elements from `ans1`. This is because multiplying an element by -1 and then adding it to the sum is equivalent to subtracting twice its value from the sum.

4. **Adjusting the Sum**:
   - The function then iterates over the first `k` elements of the array (the largest elements that Alice can remove).
   - For each element, it adds the element to `ans1` (undoing the initial subtraction of twice its value) and, if possible, subtracts twice the value of the element at position `i + x` (undoing Bob's operation on the smallest elements).
   - `ans2` is updated to the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` after each iteration.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum value of `ans2` for each test case, which represents the optimal sum after both Alice and Bob have played their moves.

### Analysis:

- **Alice's Strategy**:
  - Alice should remove the largest elements to maximize the sum. By sorting the array in descending order, the first `k` elements are the largest, and removing them will minimize the impact on the sum.

- **Bob's Strategy**:
  - Bob should multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum. By sorting the array in descending order, the smallest elements are at the end, and the first `x` elements of the sorted array are the largest, which are the ones Bob will target.

- **Combining Strategies**:
  - The function correctly combines both strategies by first calculating the sum after Bob's operation and then adjusting it by considering Alice's removal of the largest elements and Bob's subsequent operation on the remaining elements.

### Issues:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the edge case where `k` or `x` is equal to `n` (the length of the array) correctly.
  - It also handles the case where `k + x` is greater than `n` by checking if `i + x < n` before performing the subtraction.

- **Optimality**:
  - The function ensures that both players play optimally by considering all possible combinations of Alice's removal and Bob's multiplication operations.

### Conclusion:

The function correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum after both Alice and Bob have played their moves. The sorting and sum adjustments are done in a way that aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
