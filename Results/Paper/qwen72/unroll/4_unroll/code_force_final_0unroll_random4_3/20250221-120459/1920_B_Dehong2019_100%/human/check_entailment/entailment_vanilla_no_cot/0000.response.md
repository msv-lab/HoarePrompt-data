Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it handles the optimal plays of Alice and Bob. Specifically, the solution does not correctly account for the following aspects:

1. **Alice's Optimal Play:**
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. The current solution sorts the array in descending order, which means Alice is removing the largest elements, which is incorrect.

2. **Bob's Optimal Play:**
   - Bob should multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum. The current solution multiplies the largest elements by -1, which is incorrect.

3. **Combined Strategy:**
   - The solution does not correctly handle the combined strategy where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements by -1. The logic for updating `ans1` and `ans2` is flawed and does not reflect the optimal strategy.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Sort the Array:**
   - Sort the array in ascending order to facilitate the removal of the smallest elements by Alice and the multiplication of the smallest elements by Bob.

2. **Alice's Strategy:**
   - Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements to maximize the sum.

3. **Bob's Strategy:**
   - Bob should multiply the smallest `x` elements by -1 to minimize the sum. However, if the smallest `x` elements are already negative due to Alice's removal, Bob should consider the next smallest elements.

4. **Combined Strategy:**
   - After Alice's removal, Bob should multiply the smallest `x` elements by -1. If `x` is greater than the number of remaining elements, Bob should multiply the smallest possible elements by -1.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        # Remove the smallest k elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Multiply the smallest x elements by -1
        for i in range(min(x, len(a))):
            if a[i] > 0:
                a[i] = -a[i]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        ans = sum(a)
        
        # If there are still negative elements and x is odd, Bob can flip one more to minimize the sum
        if x % 2 == 1 and a and a[0] < 0:
            ans += 2 * a[0]
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array is sorted in ascending order to facilitate the removal of the smallest elements by Alice.

2. **Alice's Removal:**
   - Alice removes the smallest `k` elements by slicing the array `a = a[k:]`.

3. **Bob's Multiplication:**
   - Bob multiplies the smallest `x` elements by -1. This is done by iterating over the first `x` elements and changing their sign.

4. **Final Sum Calculation:**
   - The final sum is calculated using `sum(a)`.
   - If `x` is odd and there are negative elements left, Bob can flip one more element to minimize the sum. This is handled by the condition `if x % 2 == 1 and a and a[0] < 0`.

This corrected approach ensures that both Alice and Bob play optimally, and the final sum is calculated correctly.
