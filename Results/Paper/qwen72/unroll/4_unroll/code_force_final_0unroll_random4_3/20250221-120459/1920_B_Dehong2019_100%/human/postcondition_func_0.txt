The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a list of integers `a` and two integers `k` and `x`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after performing two operations: removing the largest `k` elements and multiplying the largest `x` elements by -1. The function prints the maximum sum for each test case and does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final output is the sequence of maximum sums printed for each test case.
