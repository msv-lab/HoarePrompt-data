Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the array, and two integers `k` and `x` representing the limits on the number of elements Alice can remove and Bob can multiply by -1, respectively. The list `a` should contain at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5 elements, each element `a_i` should be a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000), and `k` and `x` should be non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ len(a). Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of the lengths of the arrays across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `t` is now an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans2)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
