You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `b` and `c`, it prints 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' to the console. The function does not return any value. The variables `b`, `c`, and `q` are updated in each iteration, but their final values after the loop are the values from the last iteration. The function does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, or `m` (if they exist outside the function).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes, respectively.

2. **Conditions:**
   - **If `b == c`:**
     - This condition checks if the number of moves is equal to the desired number of cubes. If so, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired tower height. This is correct.
   - **If `b < c`:**
     - This condition checks if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes. If so, it is impossible to build a tower with `c` cubes because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move. This is correct.
   - **If `a % 2 == b % 2`:**
     - This condition checks if the parity (odd or even) of the number of test cases `a` is the same as the parity of the number of moves `b`. However, the parity of `a` (the number of test cases) is irrelevant to the problem. The correct condition should be checking the parity of `b` and `c`.
   - **Else:**
     - If none of the above conditions are met, the program outputs "No". This is correct for the case where `b` and `c` have different parities.

3. **Correct Condition:**
   - The correct condition to check is whether `b` and `c` have the same parity. If they do, it is possible to build a tower with `c` cubes after `b` moves. This is because the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must be even (i.e., the number of moves to add and remove cubes must balance out to achieve the desired height).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the condition `a % 2 == b % 2`. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
