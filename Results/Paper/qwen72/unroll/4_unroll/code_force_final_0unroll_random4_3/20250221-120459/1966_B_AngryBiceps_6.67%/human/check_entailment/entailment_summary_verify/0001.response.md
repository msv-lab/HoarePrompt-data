### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, and stores the grid in a list `a`.

2. **Grid Analysis:**
   - The function constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
   - `first_row` is a concatenation of the first character of each row.
   - `last_row` is a concatenation of the last character of each row.

3. **Conditions for "NO":**
   - **Condition 1:** `len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]`
     - This condition checks if the first row is entirely one color and if it is different from the last row. If this is true, it means that the first row and the last row are different, and since the first row is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color by performing the operations described.
   - **Condition 2:** `len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row`
     - This condition checks if the first column (formed by the first characters of each row) is entirely one color and if it is different from the last column (formed by the last characters of each row). If this is true, it means that the first column and the last column are different, and since the first column is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color by performing the operations described.

4. **Conditions for "YES":**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function prints "YES".

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** `len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]`
  - This condition is correct. If the first row is entirely one color and different from the last row, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
- **Condition 2:** `len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row`
  - This condition is also correct. If the first column is entirely one color and different from the last column, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

### Additional Considerations:
- The function does not explicitly check if the grid is already uniform (all 'W' or all 'B'). However, this is implicitly covered by the conditions. If the grid is already uniform, neither condition will be met, and the function will print "YES".
- The function assumes that the grid is non-empty and that the input is valid, which is reasonable given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
- The conditions are sufficient to determine if it is possible to make the entire grid the same color.
- The logic is sound and covers all the necessary cases based on the problem description.
- The function correctly handles the input and output as specified.

Final: **True**
