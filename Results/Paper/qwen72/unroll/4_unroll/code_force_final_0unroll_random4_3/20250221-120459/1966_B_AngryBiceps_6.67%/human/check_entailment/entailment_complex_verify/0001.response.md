### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, and stores the grid in a list `a`.

2. **Grid Analysis:**
   - The function constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
   - `first_row` is a concatenation of the first character of each row.
   - `last_row` is a concatenation of the last character of each row.

3. **Conditions for "NO":**
   - **Condition 1:** `len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]`
     - This condition checks if the first row is entirely one color and if it is different from the last row. If this is true, it means that the first row and the last row are different, and since the first row is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color by performing the operations described.
   - **Condition 2:** `len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row`
     - This condition checks if the first column (formed by the first characters of each row) is entirely one color and if it is different from the last column (formed by the last characters of each row). If this is true, it means that the first column and the last column are different, and since the first column is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color by performing the operations described.

4. **Conditions for "YES":**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function prints "YES".

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** `len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]`
  - This condition is valid. If the first row is entirely one color and the last row is a different color, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform because the first row cannot be changed to match the last row without changing the last row to match the first row, which would require a different color to be present in the first row.
- **Condition 2:** `len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row`
  - This condition is also valid. If the first column is entirely one color and the last column is a different color, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform because the first column cannot be changed to match the last column without changing the last column to match the first column, which would require a different color to be present in the first column.

### Additional Considerations:
- The function does not account for the possibility that the grid might already be uniform (all squares the same color) from the start. However, this is implicitly covered by the conditions. If the grid is already uniform, neither condition will be met, and the function will print "YES".
- The function does not explicitly check if the entire grid can be made uniform by other means, but the conditions are sufficient to determine the impossibility of making the grid uniform. If neither condition is met, it is possible to make the grid uniform by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

### Conclusion:
- The conditions are sufficient to determine if it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. If either of the conditions is met, it is impossible to make the grid uniform. Otherwise, it is possible.
- The logic is sound and covers all the necessary cases based on the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
