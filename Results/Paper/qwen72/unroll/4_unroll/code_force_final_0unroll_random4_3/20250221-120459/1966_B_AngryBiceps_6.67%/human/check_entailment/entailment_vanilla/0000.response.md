### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, and stores the grid in a list `a`.

2. **Grid Analysis:**
   - The function constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
   - `first_row` is a concatenation of the first character of each row.
   - `last_row` is a concatenation of the last character of each row.

3. **Conditions for "NO":**
   - The function checks if the first row is entirely one color (i.e., `len(set(a[0])) == 1`) and if it is different from the last row (`a[0] != a[-1]`). If this condition is met, it prints "NO".
   - The function also checks if the `first_row` is entirely one color (i.e., `len(set(first_row)) == 1`) and if it is different from the `last_row` (`first_row != last_row`). If this condition is met, it prints "NO".

4. **Conditions for "YES":**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function prints "YES".

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** `len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]`
  - This condition checks if the first row is entirely one color and if it is different from the last row. If this is true, it means that the first row and the last row are different, and since the first row is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color by performing the operations described.
- **Condition 2:** `len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row`
  - This condition checks if the first column (formed by the first characters of each row) is entirely one color and if it is different from the last column (formed by the last characters of each row). If this is true, it means that the first column and the last column are different, and since the first column is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color by performing the operations described.

### Correctness:
- The conditions are sufficient to determine if it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. If either of the conditions is met, it is impossible to make the grid uniform. Otherwise, it is possible.
- The logic is sound and covers all the necessary cases based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
