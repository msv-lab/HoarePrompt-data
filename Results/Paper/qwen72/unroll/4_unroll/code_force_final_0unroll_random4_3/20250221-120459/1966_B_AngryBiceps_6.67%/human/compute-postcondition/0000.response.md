The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, indicating that there is at least one test case. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
