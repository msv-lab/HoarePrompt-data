You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve the problem described but lacks the necessary parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the grid and its dimensions, such as `def func(t, n, m, grid):`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid, and `grid` is a list of strings representing the rows of the grid, with each string containing 'W' and 'B' characters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself, and checks if the first row or the first and last columns are entirely the same character ('W' or 'B') but differ from the last row or the last column, respectively. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The variables `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, and stores the grid in a list `a`.

2. **Grid Analysis:**
   - The function constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row`.
   - `first_row` is a concatenation of the first character of each row.
   - `last_row` is a concatenation of the last character of each row.

3. **Conditions for "NO":**
   - The function checks if the first row is entirely one color (i.e., `len(set(a[0])) == 1`) and if it is different from the last row (`a[0] != a[-1]`). If this condition is met, it prints "NO".
   - The function also checks if the `first_row` is entirely one color (i.e., `len(set(first_row)) == 1`) and if it is different from the `last_row` (`first_row != last_row`). If this condition is met, it prints "NO".

4. **Conditions for "YES":**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function prints "YES".

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** `len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]`
  - This condition checks if the first row is entirely one color and if it is different from the last row. If this is true, it means that the first row and the last row are different, and since the first row is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color by performing the operations described.
- **Condition 2:** `len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row`
  - This condition checks if the first column (formed by the first characters of each row) is entirely one color and if it is different from the last column (formed by the last characters of each row). If this is true, it means that the first column and the last column are different, and since the first column is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color by performing the operations described.

### Correctness:
- The conditions are sufficient to determine if it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. If either of the conditions is met, it is impossible to make the grid uniform. Otherwise, it is possible.
- The logic is sound and covers all the necessary cases based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
