The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving a grid, but it lacks the necessary parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the dimensions of the grid, and the grid itself. Specifically, the function should accept `t` (the number of test cases), `n` and `m` (the dimensions of the grid), and `grid` (a list of strings representing the rows of the grid, with each string containing 'W' and 'B' characters).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, and `grid`. `t` is the number of test cases, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid, and `grid` is a list of strings representing the rows of the grid, where each string contains 'W' and 'B' characters. The function returns the result based on the grid and its dimensions for each test case.**
