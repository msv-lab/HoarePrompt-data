Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of a grid, and then reads `n` rows of the grid, where each row is a string of 'W' and 'B' characters. It checks if the first row or the first and last columns are entirely the same character ('W' or 'B') but differ from the last row or the last column, respectively. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to standard output. **
