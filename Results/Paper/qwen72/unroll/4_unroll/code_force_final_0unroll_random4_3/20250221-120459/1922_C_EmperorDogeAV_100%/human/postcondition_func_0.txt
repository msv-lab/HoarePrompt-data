The function `func_1` accepts a list of city coordinates in strictly ascending order and an integer `n` representing the number of cities. It returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers. Each integer in the list is either `1` if the next city is closer than the previous city, or the distance to the next city if the next city is not closer than the previous city.
