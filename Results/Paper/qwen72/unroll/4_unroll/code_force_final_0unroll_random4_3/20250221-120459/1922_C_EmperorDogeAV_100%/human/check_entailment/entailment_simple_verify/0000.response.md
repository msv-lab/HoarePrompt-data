Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies issues with the `func_1` function. Let's break down the problems and the reasoning step by step:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City Cost**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the cost of moving to the closest city for each city. However, it incorrectly sets the cost to 1 if the forward city is closer, and to the absolute difference between the forward city and the current city otherwise. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where the closest city is the backward city.
   - Specifically, the condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):` only checks if the forward city is closer than the backward city. If the backward city is closer, it should set the cost to the distance to the backward city, but it does not. Instead, it sets the cost to the distance to the forward city, which is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the edge cases where the city is the first or the last in the list. For the first city, there is no backward city, and for the last city, there is no forward city. The program should handle these cases appropriately.
   - In the current implementation, the first city always has a cost of 1 (since `back` is set to a very large negative number), and the last city always has a cost of 1 (since `forward` is set to a very large positive number). This is not correct because the closest city for the first and last cities should be the next and previous city, respectively, and the cost should be the distance to that city.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

- For the query `(1, 4)`, the correct answer should be 3 coins (1 coin to move from city 1 to city 2, 1 coin to move from city 2 to city 3, and 1 coin to move from city 3 to city 4). However, the program will incorrectly calculate the cost for city 1 to city 2 as 1 coin, and then for city 2 to city 3 as 4 coins (since it does not correctly handle the backward city), and so on.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Determine the closest city for each city in both directions (forward and backward).
2. Use these closest city costs to build prefix sums for both directions.
3. For each query, determine the minimum cost by considering both the direct distance and the cost of moving to the closest city step by step.

### Detailed Evaluation:
- **State Before `func_1` Call**: The `cities` list is correctly prepared as a list of integers in strictly ascending order.
- **State After `func_1` Call**: The `forward_cities` list is supposed to contain the cost of moving to the closest city in the forward direction, but due to the logical issue, it does not correctly handle the backward city. Similarly, the `backward_cities` list is supposed to contain the cost of moving to the closest city in the backward direction, but it also has the same logical issue.
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` lists, leading to incorrect results.
- **Query Handling**: The queries are handled using the incorrect prefix sums, resulting in incorrect output for some queries.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the problem as described due to the logical issues in the `func_1` function. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Final: **False**
