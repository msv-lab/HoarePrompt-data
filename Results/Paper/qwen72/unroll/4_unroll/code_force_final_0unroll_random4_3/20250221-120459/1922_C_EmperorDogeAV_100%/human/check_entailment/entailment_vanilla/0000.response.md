### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and the coordinates of the cities.
   - It then converts the city coordinates from a list of strings to a list of integers.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `back` and `forward` to very large and very small values, respectively, to handle edge cases.
   - For each city `i`, it updates `back` to the previous city and `forward` to the next city.
   - It then determines the closest city by comparing the distances to `back` and `forward`.
   - If the forward city is closer, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating a 1-coin travel to the closest city).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the closest city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for both the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` is calculated for the original list of cities.
   - `pref_sum_b` is calculated for the reversed list of cities.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly compute the total cost of traveling from one city to another.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of queries `m` and processes each query.
   - For each query, it checks if the starting city `a` is less than the destination city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum to calculate the cost.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the city is at the beginning or end of the list by setting `back` and `forward` appropriately.
   - The use of very large and very small values ensures that the closest city is always determined correctly.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the closest city for each city and calculates the minimum cost to travel between any two cities.
   - The prefix sums are used efficiently to compute the total cost for each query.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the closest city and calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel between any two cities for each query. The use of prefix sums ensures that the queries are handled efficiently, and the edge cases are appropriately managed.
