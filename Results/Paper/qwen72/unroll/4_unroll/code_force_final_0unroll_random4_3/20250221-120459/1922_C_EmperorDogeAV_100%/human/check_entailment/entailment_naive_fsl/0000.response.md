Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the problem as described. The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the cost of moving to the closest city, but it has a logical issue that causes it to produce incorrect results in some cases.

### Issue in `func_1`:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City Cost**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the cost of moving to the closest city for each city. However, it incorrectly sets the cost to 1 if the forward city is closer, and to the absolute difference between the forward city and the current city otherwise. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where the closest city is the backward city.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the edge cases where the city is the first or the last in the list. For example, for the first city, there is no backward city, and for the last city, there is no forward city. The program should handle these cases appropriately.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The program will produce incorrect results for some queries. For instance, the query `(1, 4)` should result in 3 coins, but the program's logic in `func_1` will not correctly calculate the cost of moving to the closest city for each step.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Determine the closest city for each city in both directions (forward and backward).
2. Use these closest city costs to build prefix sums for both directions.
3. For each query, determine the minimum cost by considering both the direct distance and the cost of moving to the closest city step by step.

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
