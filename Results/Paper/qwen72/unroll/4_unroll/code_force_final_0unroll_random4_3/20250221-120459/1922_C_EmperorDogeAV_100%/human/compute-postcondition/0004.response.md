The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cities` and `n`. `cities` is a list of `n` integers in strictly ascending order, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, and each city's coordinate `a_i` satisfies `0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9`. The function returns a list `prog_cities` which contains `n-1` integers. Each integer in the list is either `1` if the next city is closer than the previous city, or the distance to the next city if the next city is not closer than the previous city.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of city coordinates in strictly ascending order and an integer `n` representing the number of cities. It returns a list of `n-1` integers where each integer is `1` if the next city is closer than the previous city, or the distance to the next city if it is not closer.**
