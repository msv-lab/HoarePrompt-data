### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies issues in the `func_1` function. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City Cost**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to determine the cost of moving to the closest city for each city. However, it only checks the distance to the next city (`forward`) and the previous city (`back`). If the next city is closer, it sets the cost to 1. If the previous city is closer, it sets the cost to the distance to the next city, which is incorrect. The correct cost should be the minimum of the distance to the next city and the distance to the previous city.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The function `func_1` does not handle the edge cases correctly:
     - For the first city, there is no previous city, so the cost should be the distance to the next city.
     - For the last city, there is no next city, so the cost should be the distance to the previous city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum calculation in the main program is based on the incorrect results from `func_1`. This means that the prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` will also be incorrect, leading to incorrect answers for the queries.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Let's consider the input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

- For the first city (0):
  - `back` is -99999999999999999999 (not a valid city).
  - `forward` is 8.
  - The cost should be 8, but `func_1` sets it to 1 (incorrect).

- For the second city (8):
  - `back` is 0.
  - `forward` is 12.
  - The cost should be 4 (distance to the next city), but `func_1` sets it to 1 (incorrect).

- For the third city (12):
  - `back` is 8.
  - `forward` is 15.
  - The cost should be 3 (distance to the next city), but `func_1` sets it to 1 (incorrect).

- For the fourth city (15):
  - `back` is 12.
  - `forward` is 20.
  - The cost should be 5 (distance to the next city), but `func_1` sets it to 1 (incorrect).

- For the fifth city (20):
  - `back` is 15.
  - `forward` is 999999999999999999 (not a valid city).
  - The cost should be 5, but `func_1` sets it to 1 (incorrect).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Determine the closest city for each city in both directions (forward and backward).
2. Use these closest city costs to build prefix sums for both directions.
3. For each query, determine the minimum cost by considering both the direct distance and the cost of moving to the closest city step by step.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not correctly handle the problem as described due to the logical issues in `func_1` and the incorrect handling of edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Final: **False**
