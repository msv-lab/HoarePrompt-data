### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the city coordinates, and the number of queries `m`.
   - The city coordinates are stored in a list `cities` and converted to integers.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is called to calculate the closest city for each city in the forward direction.
   - The function `func_1` is then called again with the reversed list of cities to calculate the closest city in the backward direction.
   - The function `func_1` works as follows:
     - It initializes a list `prog_cities` of size `n-1` with zeros.
     - For each city `i` (except the last one), it calculates the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
     - It sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the next city is closer than the previous city, otherwise, it sets it to the distance to the next city.
   - This function is correct for the given problem constraints, as it ensures that the closest city is unique and correctly identifies the closest city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward closest city distances.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly compute the minimum number of coins required for each query.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the minimum number of coins required to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum to calculate the cost.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a` and `b` are in different orders.

### Issues:
- **Backward City Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` is called with the reversed list of cities to calculate the backward closest city distances.
  - However, the function `func_1` is designed to work with the forward direction. When the list is reversed, the function should be adjusted to correctly handle the reversed indices.
  - Specifically, the line `if i < n - 1: forward = cities[i + 1]` should be `if i < n - 1: forward = cities[i - 1]` when the list is reversed.

- **Distance Calculation in `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` should always return 1 for the closest city, regardless of the direction. The current implementation sometimes returns the distance to the next city, which is incorrect.
  - The correct implementation should always return 1 for the closest city.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = 1  # Always return 1 for the closest city
    
    return prog_cities
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the function `func_1` is corrected as described above.
- **False** if the function `func_1` remains unchanged, as it will not always return the correct closest city distance.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not always return 1 for the closest city, and the backward direction calculation is not adjusted properly.
