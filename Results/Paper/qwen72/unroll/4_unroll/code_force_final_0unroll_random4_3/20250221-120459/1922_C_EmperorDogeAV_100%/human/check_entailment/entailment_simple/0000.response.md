### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and their coordinates `cities`.
   - It then converts the `cities` list from strings to integers.
   - The program calls `func_1` to determine the closest city for each city in the forward direction and stores the result in `forward_cities`.
   - It reverses the `cities` list and calls `func_1` again to determine the closest city for each city in the backward direction, storing the result in `backward_cities`.
   - It then reverses `backward_cities` to align it with the original city order.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for both `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` and stores them in `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` respectively.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly compute the total cost of traveling from one city to another.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of queries `m`.
   - For each query, it reads the source city `a` and the destination city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses `pref_sum_f` to compute the cost of traveling from `a` to `b`.
   - If `a > b`, it uses `pref_sum_b` to compute the cost of traveling from `a` to `b`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city in the given direction (forward or backward).
   - It initializes `back` and `forward` with extreme values to handle edge cases.
   - It correctly updates `back` and `forward` based on the current city's position.
   - It compares the distances to the previous and next cities and updates `prog_cities` accordingly.
   - The function returns `prog_cities`, which is a list of `n-1` integers where each integer is either 1 (if the next city is closer) or the distance to the next city.

### Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling in `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` has a logical error in the way it handles the `forward` and `back` distances.
  - Specifically, the condition `if i < n - 1: forward = cities[i + 1]` is incorrect because `i` can be `n-1` in the loop, but `cities[i + 1]` would be out of bounds.
  - Additionally, the condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back): prog_cities[i] = 1` is incorrect because it should always be `1` if the next city is closer, and the distance to the next city if the previous city is closer.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) <= abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - back)
    
    return prog_cities
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the function `func_1` is corrected as shown above.
- **False** if the function `func_1` is not corrected, as the current implementation will not handle the edge cases correctly and may produce incorrect results.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the logical errors in the `func_1` function, which need to be fixed as described above.
