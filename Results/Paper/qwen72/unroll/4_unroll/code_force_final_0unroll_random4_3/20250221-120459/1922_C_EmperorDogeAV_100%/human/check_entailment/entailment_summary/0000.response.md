Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, the number of cities `n`, the city coordinates, and the number of queries `m`. It also reads each query and processes it accordingly.

2. **City Distance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the closest city for each city in the list. However, there is a logical error in the function. The function should return the distance to the closest city, but it is currently returning `1` if the next city is closer than the previous city, or the distance to the next city otherwise. This is incorrect because it should always return the distance to the closest city, not just the next city.
   - The correct approach is to compare the distance to the previous city and the next city and store the minimum distance in `prog_cities`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward distances. This is a good approach to efficiently answer the queries.
   - The prefix sums are calculated correctly for both forward and backward directions.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - The program processes each query by checking if the starting city `a` is less than the destination city `b`. If so, it uses the forward prefix sum; otherwise, it uses the backward prefix sum.
   - The difference in prefix sums is used to determine the minimum number of coins required to travel from city `a` to city `b`.

5. **Logical Error in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` should return the distance to the closest city, not just `1` or the distance to the next city.
   - The correct logic should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(cities, n):
         prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
         for i in range(n - 1):
             back = -99999999999999999999
             forward = 999999999999999999
             if i > 0:
                 back = cities[i - 1]
             if i < n - 1:
                 forward = cities[i + 1]
             if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
                 prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
             else:
                 prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - back)
         return prog_cities
     ```

6. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program is sound, but the error in `func_1` affects the correctness of the results.

Given the logical error in `func_1`, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
