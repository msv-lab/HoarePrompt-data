Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all piles have the same number of stones correctly. According to the problem description, if all piles have the same number of stones, Alice can win by removing all stones in one move. However, the program incorrectly determines the winner based on the sorted unique values of the piles, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
The expected output is "Alice" because Alice can remove all stones in one move. However, the program will output "Bob" because it incorrectly processes the set and the subsequent logic.
