The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times` such that 0 <= `times` <= `len(arr)`. It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-len(arr), -1 - times)`. This means it calculates the difference between the last element and the element that is `times` positions from the end of the list. If `times` is 0, the difference is between the last element and itself, resulting in 0. If `times` is equal to the length of `arr`, the difference is between the last element and the first element of the list.
