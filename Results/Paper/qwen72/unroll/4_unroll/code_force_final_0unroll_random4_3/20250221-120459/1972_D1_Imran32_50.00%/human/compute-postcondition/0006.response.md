The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers with the constraint 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value or condition is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, both within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
