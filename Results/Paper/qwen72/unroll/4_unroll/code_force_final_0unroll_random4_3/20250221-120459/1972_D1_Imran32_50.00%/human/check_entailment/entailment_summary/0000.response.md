Reasoning:  
The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the program calculates a different value, which is the sum of \(n\) and the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to the square root of \(n\). This calculation does not address the conditions specified in the problem.

Additionally, the function `func_1` reads the input variables as `n` and `k`, but the problem description specifies that the input should be `n` and `m`. The variable `k` is not used in the function, which further indicates that the program is not solving the intended problem.

Given these discrepancies, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
