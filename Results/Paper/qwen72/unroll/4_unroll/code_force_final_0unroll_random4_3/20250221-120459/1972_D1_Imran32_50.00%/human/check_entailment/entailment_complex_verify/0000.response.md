### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from the input. However, the variable \(k\) is not used in the function, which suggests a potential issue.
   - The program initializes `ans` to \(n\) and then iterates from \(2\) to \(\sqrt{n} + 1\).
   - For each \(i\) in the range, it calculates `cnt` as \(i \times i\) and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations confirm that the function reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) but does not use \(k\).
   - The function calculates a new value `ans` by starting with \(n\) and adding the sum of \((n + i) // (i \times i)\) for all integers \(i\) from \(2\) to \(\sqrt{n} + 1\).
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, which is not the number of valid pairs as required by the problem statement.

4. **Original Assessment Validation**:
   - The original assessment states that the program does not correctly solve the problem.
   - The program does not implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The program instead calculates a different value, which is not aligned with the problem statement.
   - For example, for the input `2 3`, the correct output should be `3` (pairs (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2)), but the program will not produce this output.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It calculates a different value that is not related to the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions.

Final: **False**
