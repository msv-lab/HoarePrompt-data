Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is calculating a value that does not correspond to the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it appears to be performing a different calculation that is not related to the problem statement. The logic inside `func_1` is not aligned with the conditions specified in the problem, and it does not even use the variable `k` (which should be `m` based on the problem description). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
