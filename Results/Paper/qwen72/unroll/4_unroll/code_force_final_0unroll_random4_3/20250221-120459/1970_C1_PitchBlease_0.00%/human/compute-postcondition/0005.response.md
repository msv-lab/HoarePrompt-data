Output State: **`tree` is a defaultdict(list) where each node u (1 <= u <= n) has a list of adjacent nodes v that are directly connected to u by an edge, `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged, `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one adjacent node in `tree`, `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to the first node in `leaves` as calculated by the `bfs` function, `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to the second node in `leaves` as calculated by the `bfs` function.**

Explanation:
- The code `dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])` calculates the shortest distance from the `start` node to the second node in the `leaves` list using the `bfs` function.
- The initial state variables `tree`, `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.
- The variable `leaves` is also unchanged, as it is only used to access the second node in the list.
- The variable `dist1` remains the same, as it is not modified by this code snippet.
- The new variable `dist2` is assigned the value of the shortest distance from `start` to the second node in `leaves` as calculated by the `bfs` function.
