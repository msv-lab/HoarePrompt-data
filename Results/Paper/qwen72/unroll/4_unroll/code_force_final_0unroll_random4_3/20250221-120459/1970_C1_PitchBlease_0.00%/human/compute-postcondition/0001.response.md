Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, and `tree` is a dictionary or list representing the adjacency list of the tree, with each key or index corresponding to a node and the value being a list of its neighbors. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.**
