You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, if n > 1, the minimum value between `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` is printed. If n == 1, the value of `a` is printed. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The program calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts by comparing the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`ans1 = a * n`) with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price (`ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`). It then prints the minimum of these two costs. This approach ensures that the program always finds the minimum cost for any valid input within the given constraints.
