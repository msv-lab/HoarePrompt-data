Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The program calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts by comparing the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`ans1 = a * n`) with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price (`ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`). It then prints the minimum of these two costs. This approach ensures that the program always finds the minimum cost for any valid input within the given constraints.
