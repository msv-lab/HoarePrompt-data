Output State: **The function `R` is defined to read a line of input, convert it to an integer, and return that integer. The secret permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, remains unchanged. The function can still make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements from the permutation. The function must still find and output a pair of indices (i, j) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, and 0 ≤ i, j < n. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4. `I` is still a function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each part to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.**
