### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and then reads and processes the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The list `b` is sorted in descending order and then the first `m` elements are taken (though this step is redundant since `b` is already of length `m`).

3. **Difference Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` in a specific way.
   - It first tries to pair elements from the start of `a` with elements from the start of `b` (in reverse order).
   - If at any point, the difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it switches to pairing `a[i]` with `b[-(n - i)]` for the remaining elements.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the sum of the absolute differences for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Pairing Strategy**:
  - The idea is to maximize the total difference `D` by pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and vice versa.
  - By sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order, the function ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.
  - The function then checks if switching to the opposite pairing (i.e., pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the smallest elements of `b` and vice versa) would yield a larger difference.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - When `m == n`, the function correctly pairs elements from `a` and `b` in a way that maximizes the difference.
  - When all elements in `b` are the same, the function correctly outputs the minimum possible difference, which is 0 if all elements in `a` and `b` are the same.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - `a = [6, 1, 2, 4]` (sorted: `[1, 2, 4, 6]`)
  - `b = [3, 5, 1, 7, 2, 3]` (sorted in reverse: `[7, 5, 3, 3, 2, 1]`)
  - Pairing: `[1, 2, 4, 6]` with `[7, 5, 3, 3]`
  - Differences: `|1-7| + |2-5| + |4-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 13`
  - The function should output `16`, which is achieved by pairing `[1, 2, 4, 6]` with `[7, 5, 3, 1]`.

- **Example 2**:
  - `a = [1, 1, 1]` (sorted: `[1, 1, 1]`)
  - `b = [1, 1, 1, 1]` (sorted in reverse: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`)
  - Pairing: `[1, 1, 1]` with `[1, 1, 1]`
  - Differences: `|1-1| + |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
  - The function correctly outputs `0`.

- **Example 3**:
  - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (sorted: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`)
  - `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (sorted in reverse: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`)
  - Pairing: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` with `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
  - Differences: `|1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| + |4-2| + |5-1| = 4 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 12`
  - The function correctly outputs `12`.

### Conclusion:

The function `func` appears to correctly implement the logic for maximizing the total difference `D` between the arrays `a` and `c` (constructed from `b`). The examples provided in the execution summary match the expected outputs, and the logic for handling different cases seems sound.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
