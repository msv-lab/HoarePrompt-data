Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it selects elements from the `b` array. Specifically, the line `b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]` is incorrect. The `[:m]` slice is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because `b` should contain all `m` integers, not just the first `m` integers after sorting.

Additionally, the logic for choosing the elements from the `b` array to maximize the difference is flawed. The program attempts to choose the largest possible differences by comparing `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` and `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, but this approach does not always guarantee the maximum total difference.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 6
6 1 2 4
3 5 1 7 2 3
```
The expected output is `16`, as Vasya can create the array `(1, 5, 7, 2)` to maximize the difference.

However, the program will output a different result. Here's why:
- `a` is sorted to `[1, 2, 4, 6]`.
- `b` is sorted in reverse to `[7, 5, 3, 3, 2, 1]`.

The program will then:
- Compare `abs(1 - 1)` and `abs(1 - 7)`, and choose `abs(1 - 7) = 6`.
- Compare `abs(2 - 2)` and `abs(2 - 5)`, and choose `abs(2 - 5) = 3`.
- Compare `abs(4 - 3)` and `abs(4 - 3)`, and choose `abs(4 - 3) = 1`.
- Compare `abs(6 - 3)` and `abs(6 - 1)`, and choose `abs(6 - 1) = 5`.

The total difference is `6 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 15`, which is less than the expected `16`.

Thus, the program does not always produce the correct maximum difference.
