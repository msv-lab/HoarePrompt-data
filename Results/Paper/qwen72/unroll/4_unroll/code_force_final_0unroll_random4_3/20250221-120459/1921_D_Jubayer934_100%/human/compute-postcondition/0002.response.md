The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `m`: an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `b`.
- `a_i`: a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of list `a`.
- `b_i`: a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of list `b`.

The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the input. The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, two integers `n` and `m` where `n` is the length of list `a` and `m` is the length of list `b`, and two lists `a_i` and `b_i` of integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `a_i` and `b_i` for each test case.**
