You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: The loop processes each test case, and for each test case, it prints the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of the sorted list `a` and the reversed sorted list `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are not directly modified by the loop, but the loop uses their values to compute the result for each test case. After all iterations, the loop has completed its execution, and the final output state is the sum of the minimum absolute differences for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It computes the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of the sorted list `a` and elements of the reversed sorted list `b`. The function prints the sum for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are not modified by the function, and the final state of the program is the printed sum for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array `b` is sorted in descending order.
   - This sorting is done to maximize the difference between elements of `a` and `b`.

3. **Initial Difference Calculation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the differences.
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and the first `n` elements of `b` (since `m >= n`).
   - For each element, it calculates the difference `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and appends it to `ans`.

4. **Optimal Difference Calculation:**
   - The program checks if there is a point where the difference `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` is greater than `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.
   - If such a point is found, it sets `temp` to the index `i` and breaks the loop.
   - This is done to ensure that the program can switch to using the largest possible differences from the end of the sorted `b` array.

5. **Adjusting Differences:**
   - If `temp` is set to a valid index, the program iterates from `temp` to `n` and calculates the difference `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` instead of `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.
   - This adjustment ensures that the program uses the largest possible differences to maximize `D`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The program's approach is to sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order, which is a good strategy to maximize the differences.
- The initial loop calculates the differences using the first `n` elements of `b` in descending order.
- The program checks for a point where switching to the end of the sorted `b` array would yield a larger difference and makes the necessary adjustments.
- This approach ensures that the program always uses the largest possible differences to maximize `D`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference `D` for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
