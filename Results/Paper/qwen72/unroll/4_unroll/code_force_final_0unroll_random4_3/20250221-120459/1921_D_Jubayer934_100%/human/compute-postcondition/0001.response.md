Output State: **The loop processes each test case, and for each test case, it prints the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of the sorted list `a` and the reversed sorted list `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are not directly modified by the loop, but the loop uses their values to compute the result for each test case. After all iterations, the loop has completed its execution, and the final output state is the sum of the minimum absolute differences for each test case.**
