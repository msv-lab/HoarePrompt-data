Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Selection**: 
   - The array `a` is sorted and the first `n` elements are considered.
   - The array `b` is sorted in reverse order and the first `m` elements are considered.

3. **Difference Calculation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the differences.
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of the sorted `a` and `b` arrays.
   - For each element, it checks whether the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` (the last elements of the sorted `b` array) is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` (the first elements of the sorted `b` array).
   - If the difference with the last element is greater, it sets a flag `temp` to the current index and breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it appends the difference `abs(a[i] - b[i])` to the `ans` list.

4. **Handling the Flag**:
   - If `temp` is set (i.e., `temp != -1`), it means that for some index `i`, the difference with the last element of `b` was greater. In this case, it continues to append the differences `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for the remaining elements starting from `temp`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the sum of the differences stored in the `ans` list.

This approach ensures that the program maximizes the total difference `D` by considering the largest possible differences between elements of `a` and `b`. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
