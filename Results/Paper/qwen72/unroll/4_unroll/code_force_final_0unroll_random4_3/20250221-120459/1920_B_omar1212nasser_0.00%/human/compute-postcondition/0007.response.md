To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `removals`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, removals + 1)`. The variables involved are `i` and `removals`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `removals` is at least 1. This is because `range(1, removals + 1)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 and ending at `removals` (inclusive). If `removals` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` will be 1, as specified by the `range(1, removals + 1)`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`removals`**: To ensure the loop executes, `removals` must be greater than 0.
- **`i`**: The initial value of `i` is 1, as it is the starting point of the range.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `removals` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1.

State: **`removals` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= `elements`[i] <= 1000, and either `removals` is not equal to 6, or `negatives` is not equal to 3. `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * n`. `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`. `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`.**
