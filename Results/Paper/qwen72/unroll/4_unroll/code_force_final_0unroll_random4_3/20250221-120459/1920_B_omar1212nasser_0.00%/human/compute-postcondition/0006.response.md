The code snippet `pos.append(s - 2 * n)` appends the value `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. Here, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`. The value `s - 2 * n` is calculated and added to `pos`.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`), and `elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= `elements`[i] <= 1000. Additionally, either `removals` is not equal to 6, or `negatives` is not equal to 3. `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * n`. `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`. `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`.**
