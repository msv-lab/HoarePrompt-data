### Reasoning:

1. **Hard-Coded Condition**:
   - The function `func_2` contains a hard-coded condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0`. This is indeed a specific case and not a general solution. It will fail for other inputs that should logically return a different result. For example, the input `6 6 3` with elements `1 2 3 4 5 6` should result in a sum of 0 after Alice removes all elements, but the program will not return 0 for this input because it will not reach the hard-coded condition.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The problem requires Alice to remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum and Bob to negate the largest elements to minimize the sum. However, the current logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement this strategy.
   - The variable `s` is initialized as the sum of all elements in the array. The variable `n` is initialized as the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the array. This is incorrect because Bob should negate the largest elements, not the last elements.
   - The loop iterates over the range `1` to `removals + 1` and subtracts the `i`-th largest element from `s` and adjusts `n` accordingly. This approach does not consider the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.

3. **IndexError Handling**:
   - The `try-except` block is used to handle `IndexError` when accessing elements beyond the array's bounds. While this prevents the program from crashing, it does not ensure the correct logic for the game.

### Correct Approach:
- **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements to maximize the sum.
- **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should negate the largest `x` elements to minimize the sum.
- **Combined Strategy**: After Alice's removal, Bob should negate the largest `x` elements from the remaining array.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `1 1 1` with elements `[1]`
  - Alice removes the only element. The sum is `0`.
  - Bob has no elements to negate.
  - Expected output: `0` (Correct).

- **Test Case 2**: `4 1 1` with elements `[3, 1, 2, 4]`
  - Alice removes the smallest element `1`. The remaining elements are `[3, 2, 4]`.
  - Bob negates the largest element `4`. The remaining elements are `[3, 2, -4]`.
  - The sum is `3 + 2 - 4 = 1`.
  - Expected output: `1` (Incorrect, the program outputs `2`).

- **Test Case 5**: `8 5 3` with elements `[5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2, 9, 9]`
  - Alice removes the smallest 5 elements `[2, 3, 3, 3, 3]`. The remaining elements are `[5, 5, 9, 9]`.
  - Bob negates the largest 3 elements `[9, 9, 5]`. The remaining elements are `[5, -9, -9, -5]`.
  - The sum is `5 - 9 - 9 - 5 = -18`.
  - Expected output: `-18` (Incorrect, the program outputs `-5`).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly and does not implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. The hard-coded condition and the flawed logic for handling removals and negations are the primary issues.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
