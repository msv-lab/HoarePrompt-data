The function `func` is intended to accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should accept an integer `n` representing the number of cells, and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers 0 or 1, where 0 represents a free cell and 1 represents a cell with a chip. The parameters `t`, `n`, and `a` have the following constraints: 1 <= t <= 1000, 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` contains at least one chip (1). The function returns the minimum number of moves required to move all chips to the same cell for each test case.
