The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `n` and the list `a` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 0**
