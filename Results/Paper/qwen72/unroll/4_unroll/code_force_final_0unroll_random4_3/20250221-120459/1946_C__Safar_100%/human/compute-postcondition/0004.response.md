Output State: **`g` is a list of lists where each list `g[a]` contains the vertices that are connected to vertex `a` by an edge, and `g[b]` contains the vertices that are connected to vertex `b` by an edge. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged. `c` is 0. `l` is 1.**

The value of `l` is set to 1. All other variables and their values remain the same as in the initial state.
