The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 2. However, this does not ensure that `x` is not equal to 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to ensure it is not equal to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18 for each test case, `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 0 or 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0**
