Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, where `1 <= q <= 1000`. It then processes `q` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`). For each test case, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' in all other cases. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are left with the values of the last test case. The variable `mn` remains unchanged at 100, and `q` is reduced by the number of test cases processed. **
