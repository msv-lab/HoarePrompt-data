You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and return the maximum number of draws that could have happened or -1 if the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The function will have printed the maximum number of draws for each set of inputs or -1 if the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, and the loop will have completed all `t` iterations. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) from the input. It then calculates and prints the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on these scores, or -1 if the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `t` remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Check for Valid Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.

3. **Calculate Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws.
   - The formula used is `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total number of points.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score `v[2]` does not exceed the sum of the other two scores by more than the points that can be gained from wins. If `v[2]` is greater than `v[0] + v[1]`, it means the highest score is not achievable with the given scores, and the program should print `-1`.
     - The expression `v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` gives the total points that can be attributed to draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws, as each draw contributes 2 points.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (all scores are 0) correctly by printing `0`.
   - The program also handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, such as `1 1 1` or `3 3 3`, by printing `-1`.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the sum is 0, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 0.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the sum is 2, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 1.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the sum is 3, which is odd, so the program prints `-1`.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the sum is 4, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 2.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the sum is 9, which is odd, so the program prints `-1`.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the sum is 12, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 6.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is 12, which is even, and the maximum number of draws is 2.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws or identify invalid scores. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
