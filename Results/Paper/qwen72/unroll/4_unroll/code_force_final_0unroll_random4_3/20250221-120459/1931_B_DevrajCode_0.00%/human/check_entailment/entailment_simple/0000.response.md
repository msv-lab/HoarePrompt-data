### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases `n`, and the rest are the elements of the water containers.
   - However, the program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It only processes the first test case and ignores the rest. This is a significant issue because the problem requires processing multiple test cases.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n` and `a` as arguments.
   - The function first calculates the total amount of water in all containers and checks if the total is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'No'. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant and will never trigger.
   - The function then calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
   - It initializes a variable `container` to 0, which is used to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the target amount.
   - The function iterates through the list `a` and updates `container` by adding the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it returns 'No'. This is because if `container` becomes negative, it means that at some point, the cumulative amount of water in the containers being considered is less than the target, which implies that it is impossible to balance the water without violating the condition `i < j`.

3. **Final State:**
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to balance the water.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It reads all input at once and processes only the first test case, ignoring the rest. This is a critical flaw because the problem explicitly states that there can be multiple test cases, and the program should output the result for each test case.

- **Logic for Balancing Water:**
  - The logic inside `func_1` is correct for a single test case. The function correctly determines whether it is possible to balance the water in the containers by ensuring that the cumulative difference never becomes negative.

### Conclusion:
- **Correctness: False**
  - The program is incorrect because it fails to handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. The logic for a single test case is correct, but the overall program structure is flawed.
