Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. The logic within `func_1` is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the process of pouring water from one container to another. The function calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total water divided by the number of containers. It then iterates through the list of water amounts, adjusting the cumulative water difference (`container`) as it goes. If at any point `container` becomes negative, the function returns 'No', indicating that it is not possible to balance the water levels.

However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of pouring water from a container with more water to a container with less water in a way that could balance the water levels. The cumulative water difference (`container`) should not be used to determine the possibility of balancing the water levels. Instead, the program should check if the water can be redistributed such that no container has less water than the target amount before the redistribution is complete.

The correct approach would be to check if the water can be redistributed by ensuring that the sum of the water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers and that the water can be poured from higher to lower containers without violating the condition `i < j`.

Correctness: **False**
