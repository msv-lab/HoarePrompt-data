### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Total Water Divisibility**:
   - The program first calculates the total amount of water in all containers and checks if this total is divisible by `n`. However, this check is redundant because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. Therefore, the condition `if (total_water % n != 0)` will never be true, and the program will never return 'No' at this point.

2. **Target Water Calculation**:
   - The target amount of water in each container is calculated as `target = total_water // n`. This is correct because the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, so `target` will be an integer.

3. **Balancing Water**:
   - The program then iterates through each container and calculates the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target amount. This is done by the line `container += water - target`.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, the function returns 'No'. This is because a negative `container` value indicates that more water has been poured out than has been poured in, which means it's impossible to balance the water levels without violating the condition that water can only be poured from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.

4. **Final Check**:
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'. This indicates that it is possible to balance the water levels in the containers.

### Analysis of the Provided Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 1`, `a = [43]`
  - The target is `43 // 1 = 43`.
  - `container` will be `43 - 43 = 0`.
  - The function returns 'Yes', which is correct.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `a = [1, 3]`
  - The target is `(1 + 3) // 2 = 2`.
  - `container` will be `1 - 2 = -1` after the first iteration.
  - The function returns 'No', which is correct because it's impossible to balance the water levels without violating the pouring condition.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `a = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`
  - The target is `(4 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3) // 5 = 3`.
  - `container` will be `4 - 3 = 1` after the first iteration.
  - `container` will be `1 + (5 - 3) = 3` after the second iteration.
  - `container` will be `3 + (2 - 3) = 2` after the third iteration.
  - `container` will be `2 + (1 - 3) = 0` after the fourth iteration.
  - `container` will be `0 + (3 - 3) = 0` after the fifth iteration.
  - The function returns 'Yes', which is correct.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 3`, `a = [1, 2, 3]`
  - The target is `(1 + 2 + 3) // 3 = 2`.
  - `container` will be `1 - 2 = -1` after the first iteration.
  - The function returns 'No', which is correct.

- **Test Case 5**: `n = 7`, `a = [4, 5, 5, 0, 6, 4, 4]`
  - The target is `(4 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 6 + 4 + 4) // 7 = 4`.
  - `container` will be `4 - 4 = 0` after the first iteration.
  - `container` will be `0 + (5 - 4) = 1` after the second iteration.
  - `container` will be `1 + (5 - 4) = 2` after the third iteration.
  - `container` will be `2 + (0 - 4) = -2` after the fourth iteration.
  - The function returns 'No', which is correct.

- **Test Case 6**: `n = 7`, `a = [6, 5, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4]`
  - The target is `(6 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 4) // 7 = 4`.
  - `container` will be `6 - 4 = 2` after the first iteration.
  - `container` will be `2 + (5 - 4) = 3` after the second iteration.
  - `container` will be `3 + (5 - 4) = 4` after the third iteration.
  - `container` will be `4 + (1 - 4) = 1` after the fourth iteration.
  - `container` will be `1 + (3 - 4) = 0` after the fifth iteration.
  - `container` will be `0 + (4 - 4) = 0` after the sixth iteration.
  - `container` will be `0 + (4 - 4) = 0` after the seventh iteration.
  - The function returns 'Yes', which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to balance the water levels in the containers. The function `func_1` works as intended and handles the given test cases correctly.
