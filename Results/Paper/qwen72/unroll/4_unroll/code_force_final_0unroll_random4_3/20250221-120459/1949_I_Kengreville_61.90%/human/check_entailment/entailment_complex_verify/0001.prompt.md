You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and `n` sets of coordinates and radii from the user input, storing them in lists `x`, `y`, and `r` respectively. It then processes these sets using a depth-first search (DFS) to determine if there is at least one non-zero value in the `coef1` list after the DFS completes. If such a value exists, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

If `visited[i]` is `False`, the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists are modified as follows: For each disk `j` that has not been visited and whose center is exactly `r[i] + r[j]` units away from the center of disk `i`, `visited[j]` becomes `True`, `coef0[j]` is updated to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is updated to `-coef1[i]`, and `j` is appended to `nodes`. If `visited[i]` is `True`, no changes are made to any of the lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` accepts an integer `i` representing the index of a disk. It marks the disk at index `i` as visited if it has not been visited before and appends `i` to the `nodes` list. It then recursively visits all disks `j` that have not been visited and whose centers are exactly `r[i] + r[j]` units away from the center of disk `i`. For each such disk `j`, it updates `visited[j]` to `True`, `coef0[j]` to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` to `-coef1[i]`, and appends `j` to the `nodes` list. If the disk at index `i` has already been visited, the function returns without making any changes. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of disks `n` and initializes arrays for the coordinates `x`, `y`, and radii `r` of the disks.
   - It also initializes arrays `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to keep track of visited nodes and coefficients for the radii changes.
   - The `nodes` list is used to store the indices of the disks in the current connected component.

2. **DFS Function:**
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the connected component of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - It marks the current disk `i` as visited and appends its index to the `nodes` list.
   - For each disk `j` that is not visited and is tangent to disk `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii), it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for disk `j` and recursively calls `dfs` on disk `j`.

3. **Main Function:**
   - The main function `func_1` iterates over all disks and performs a DFS on each unvisited disk to explore its connected component.
   - It calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for the disks in the current connected component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is non-zero for any connected component, it sets `ok` to `True`, indicating that it is possible to change the radii in the desired manner.
   - Finally, it prints `YES` if `ok` is `True` and `NO` otherwise.

### Analysis:

- **Tangency Condition:**
  - The program correctly checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the square of the sum of their radii to the square of the distance between their centers. This is a valid and efficient way to check tangency without computing the square root.

- **Connected Components:**
  - The program uses DFS to explore connected components of tangent disks. This is a correct approach because it ensures that all disks that are tangent to each other are grouped together.

- **Coefficient Calculation:**
  - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to determine if it is possible to change the radii such that the sum of the radii decreases while maintaining tangency. The calculation of `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` is based on the idea that if two disks are tangent, their radii changes should be inversely related to maintain tangency.

- **Sum of Coefficients:**
  - The program checks if the sum of `coef1` for any connected component is non-zero. If `c1 != 0`, it means that there is a way to change the radii of the disks in that component such that the sum of the radii decreases. This is because a non-zero sum of `coef1` implies that there is a non-trivial linear combination of the radii changes that can result in a decrease in the total sum of radii.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. It uses DFS to find connected components of tangent disks and calculates the necessary coefficients to check if the sum of the radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
