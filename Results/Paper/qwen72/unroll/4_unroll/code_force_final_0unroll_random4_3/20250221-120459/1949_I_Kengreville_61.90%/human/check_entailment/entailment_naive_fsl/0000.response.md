Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the problem as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining if it is possible to change the radii of the disks such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap is flawed.

### Issue:
1. **DFS Logic and Coefficients**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other. However, the way coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) are assigned and used to determine if the sum of radii can be decreased is not clear and does not seem to follow a well-defined mathematical or logical approach.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to balance the changes in radii, but the logic for setting these coefficients and the final check `c1 != 0` is not sufficient to ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the disks are already in a configuration that cannot be changed to meet the requirements. For example, if all disks are already tangent to each other and their radii are such that any change would cause overlap or break tangency, the program should return `NO`. However, the current logic might incorrectly return `YES`.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
3
0 0 1
2 0 1
4 0 1
```
- The disks are arranged in a line, each tangent to the next.
- If we try to decrease the radii of the first and third disks by 0.5 and increase the radius of the second disk by 1.0, the sum of radii would remain the same (1 + 1 + 1 = 3, and 0.5 + 2 + 0.5 = 3).
- The program should return `NO` because it is not possible to strictly decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. However, the current logic might incorrectly return `YES`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
