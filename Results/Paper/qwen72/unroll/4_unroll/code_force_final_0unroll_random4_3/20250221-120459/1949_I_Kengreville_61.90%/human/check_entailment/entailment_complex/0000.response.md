Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of disks `n` and their coordinates and radii, storing them in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r`. This part of the function is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Initialization**: The lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized appropriately. `visited` is a list of booleans to keep track of which disks have been processed, `coef0` and `coef1` are initialized to `None` and will be used to store coefficients that help in determining the feasibility of changing the radii.

3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is designed to explore the connected components of the graph formed by the disks. It correctly marks a disk as visited and processes its neighbors if they are tangent to the current disk. The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated based on the tangency condition, which is a key part of the algorithm to ensure that the sum of radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency.

4. **DFS Execution**: In `func_1`, the `dfs` function is called for each disk that has not been visited. This ensures that all connected components of the graph are explored.

5. **Feasibility Check**: After the DFS, the function checks if the sum of `coef1` values for the disks in the current connected component is non-zero. If any connected component has a non-zero sum of `coef1` values, it means that it is possible to change the radii in such a way that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency. The `ok` variable is used to track this condition.

6. **Output**: Finally, the function prints `YES` if at least one connected component has a non-zero sum of `coef1` values, otherwise it prints `NO`.

The overall logic of the program is correct and aligns with the problem statement. The DFS ensures that all tangent disks are considered, and the coefficients are used to determine if the radii can be adjusted as required.

Correctness: **True**
