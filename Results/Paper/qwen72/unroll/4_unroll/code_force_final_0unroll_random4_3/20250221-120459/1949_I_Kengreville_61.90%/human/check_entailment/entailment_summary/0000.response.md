### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to change the radii of the disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1()`**:
     - It reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
     - It initializes lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to keep track of visited disks and coefficients.
     - It iterates over each disk and performs a DFS if the disk has not been visited.
     - After the DFS, it checks if there is at least one non-zero value in the `coef1` list. If such a value exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   
   - **`dfs(i)`**:
     - It marks the disk at index `i` as visited and appends `i` to the `nodes` list.
     - It recursively visits all disks `j` that have not been visited and are tangent to disk `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers is exactly the sum of their radii).
     - For each tangent disk `j`, it updates the coefficients `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` and appends `j` to the `nodes` list.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The algorithm uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components of tangent disks.
   - For each connected component, it sets up a system of linear equations to determine if the radii can be adjusted to meet the conditions.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to represent the linear equations for the radii changes.
   - If there is at least one non-zero value in `coef1` after processing all disks, it indicates that the radii can be adjusted to strictly decrease the total sum while maintaining tangency and non-overlap.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The DFS correctly identifies all disks that are tangent to each other.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated in a way that ensures the linear equations are set up correctly.
   - The final check for a non-zero value in `coef1` is a valid way to determine if the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the radii of the disks can be adjusted to meet the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
