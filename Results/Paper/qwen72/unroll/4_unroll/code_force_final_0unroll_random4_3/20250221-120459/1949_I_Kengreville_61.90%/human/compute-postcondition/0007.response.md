Functionality: ** The function `dfs` accepts an integer `i` representing the index of a disk. It marks the disk at index `i` as visited if it has not been visited before and appends `i` to the `nodes` list. It then recursively visits all disks `j` that have not been visited and whose centers are exactly `r[i] + r[j]` units away from the center of disk `i`. For each such disk `j`, it updates `visited[j]` to `True`, `coef0[j]` to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` to `-coef1[i]`, and appends `j` to the `nodes` list. If the disk at index `i` has already been visited, the function returns without making any changes. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
