### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of disks `n` and initializes arrays for the coordinates `x`, `y`, and radii `r` of the disks.
   - It also initializes arrays `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to keep track of visited nodes and coefficients for the radii changes.
   - The `nodes` list is used to store the indices of the disks in the current connected component.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **DFS Function:**
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the connected component of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - It marks the current disk `i` as visited and appends its index to the `nodes` list.
   - For each disk `j` that is not visited and is tangent to disk `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii), it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for disk `j` and recursively calls `dfs` on disk `j`.
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the `dfs` function. It ensures that all disks in a connected component are visited and their coefficients are updated accordingly.

3. **Main Function:**
   - The main function `func_1` iterates over all disks and performs a DFS on each unvisited disk to explore its connected component.
   - It calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for the disks in the current connected component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is non-zero for any connected component, it sets `ok` to `True`, indicating that it is possible to change the radii in the desired manner.
   - Finally, it prints `YES` if `ok` is `True` and `NO` otherwise.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Tangency Condition:**
  - The program correctly checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the square of the sum of their radii to the square of the distance between their centers. This is a valid and efficient way to check tangency without computing the square root.

- **Connected Components:**
  - The program uses DFS to explore connected components of tangent disks. This is a correct approach because it ensures that all disks that are tangent to each other are grouped together.

- **Coefficient Calculation:**
  - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to determine if it is possible to change the radii such that the sum of the radii decreases while maintaining tangency.
  - The calculation of `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` is based on the idea that if two disks are tangent, their radii changes should be inversely related to maintain tangency.
  - This is a crucial part of the program. The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to form a linear equation for the radii changes. If `coef1` is non-zero, it means that there is a non-trivial solution to the equation that can result in a decrease in the total sum of radii.

- **Sum of Coefficients:**
  - The program checks if the sum of `coef1` for any connected component is non-zero. If `c1 != 0`, it means that there is a way to change the radii of the disks in that component such that the sum of the radii decreases.
  - This is a correct approach because a non-zero sum of `coef1` implies that there is a non-trivial linear combination of the radii changes that can result in a decrease in the total sum of radii.

### Potential Issues:

- **Global Variables:**
  - The `dfs` function uses several global variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`). While this is functional, it can lead to issues if these variables are not properly managed. However, in this specific program, the variables are managed correctly, and there are no issues with their usage.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where there is only one disk (i.e., `n = 1`) correctly. In this case, the sum of radii cannot be decreased, and the program will print `NO`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. It uses DFS to find connected components of tangent disks and calculates the necessary coefficients to check if the sum of the radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency.

Therefore, the program is correct.
