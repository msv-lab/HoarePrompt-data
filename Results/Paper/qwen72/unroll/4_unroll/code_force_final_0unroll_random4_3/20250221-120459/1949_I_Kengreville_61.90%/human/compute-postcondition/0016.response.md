Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `y` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `r` is a list of integers of length `n`.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`.
- `coef0` is a list of integers of length `n` where all elements are `0`.
- `coef1` is a list of integers of length `n` where all elements are `1`.
- `nodes` is an empty list.
- `ok` is `False` because none of the `c1` values calculated in the loop are non-zero.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables and objects listed in the initial state do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the string `'NO'` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or objects.

Output: **NO**
