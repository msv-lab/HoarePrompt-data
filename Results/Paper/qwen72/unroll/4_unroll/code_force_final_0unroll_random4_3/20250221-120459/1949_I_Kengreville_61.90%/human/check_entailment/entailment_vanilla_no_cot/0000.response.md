Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program provided is intended to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to change the radii of the disks such that the conditions specified in the problem are met. However, there are several issues in the program that make it incorrect:

1. **Global Variables Usage**: The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are used globally within the `dfs` function. This is generally not a good practice and can lead to unexpected behavior. However, this alone does not make the program incorrect, but it is a potential source of bugs.

2. **DFS Function Logic**: The `dfs` function is supposed to traverse all disks that are tangent to the current disk and update the coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) accordingly. However, the logic for updating `coef0` and `coef1` is flawed. Specifically, the line `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the relationship between the radii of tangent disks.

3. **Coefficient Calculation**: The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are intended to help in determining if the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem's conditions. However, the way they are calculated and used in the `func_1` function is not correct. The program should be checking if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii decreases while maintaining tangency and non-overlapping conditions.

4. **DFS Initialization**: The `dfs` function is called within the `func_1` function, but the `nodes` list is reset to an empty list for each new component. This means that the `nodes` list will only contain the current disk and its immediate neighbors, not the entire connected component, which is necessary for the correct calculation of the coefficients.

5. **Final Check**: The final check `ok = ok or c1 != 0` is not sufficient to determine if the radii can be adjusted. The program should ensure that the sum of the radii can be strictly decreased while maintaining the tangency and non-overlapping conditions.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a system of linear equations to represent the tangency conditions and then checking if there is a feasible solution that reduces the sum of the radii. The provided program does not implement this correctly and thus is incorrect.
