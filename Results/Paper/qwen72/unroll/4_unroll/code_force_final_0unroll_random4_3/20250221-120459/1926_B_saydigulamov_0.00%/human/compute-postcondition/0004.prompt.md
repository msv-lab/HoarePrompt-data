You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is a list of n strings, each string consisting of n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, grid remains a list of n strings, each string consisting of n characters that are either '0' or '1', a remains the same input integer. The list k is populated with the counts of '1's in each input string b, but only if '1' is present in b. If the first two counts in k are equal, k is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `grid`. It returns 'triangle' if a triangle is found in the grid, and 'square' if a square is found in the grid.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
