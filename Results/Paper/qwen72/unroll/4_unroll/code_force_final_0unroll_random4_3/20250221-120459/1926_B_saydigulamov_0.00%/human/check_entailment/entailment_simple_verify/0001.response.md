### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid, `n`, and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.
   - It checks if there is at least one '1' in each row and appends the count of '1's in that row to the list `k`.

2. **Shape Determination**:
   - The program attempts to determine the shape by checking if the first and second elements of the list `k` are equal.
   - However, this check is insufficient to determine the shape. A square will have all elements in `k` equal, while a triangle will have elements that form a specific pattern (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7 for a triangle with `k=4`).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the list `k` if the first and second elements are equal, which is not the expected output according to the problem statement.
   - The correct output should be "SQUARE" if all elements in `k` are equal, and "TRIANGLE" if the elements form the pattern of a triangle.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output**:
  - The program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required.
  - Instead, it prints the list `k` if the first and second elements are equal, which is not the expected output.

- **Logic Incompleteness**:
  - The program does not handle the logic for determining if the shape is a triangle or a square.
  - It only checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements of the problem statement. It fails to correctly identify and print the shape as "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

### Final: **False**
