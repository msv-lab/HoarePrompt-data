Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the grid and counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. However, it only checks if the first two counts in the list `k` are equal and prints the list `k` if they are. This is insufficient to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle.

To correctly determine the shape, the program should:
1. Identify the pattern of '1's in the grid.
2. Check if the pattern matches the definition of a triangle or a square.
3. Print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the pattern.

The current program does not perform these steps. It simply prints the list of counts if the first two counts are equal, which does not provide the required output.

Correctness: **False**
