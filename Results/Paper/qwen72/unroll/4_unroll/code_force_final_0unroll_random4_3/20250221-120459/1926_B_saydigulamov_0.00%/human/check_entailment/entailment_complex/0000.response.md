Reasoning:

The function `func` is supposed to determine if the shape drawn on the grid is a square or a triangle. However, the function as provided does not correctly implement this logic. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling and State Management**: The function reads the number of test cases `a` and then for each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself. This part is correct.

2. **Counting '1's in Each Row**: The function correctly counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in the list `k`.

3. **Shape Determination**: The function checks if the first two counts in `k` are equal. If they are, it prints the list `k`. This is incorrect because:
   - It should print "SQUARE" if the counts in `k` indicate a square.
   - It should print "TRIANGLE" if the counts in `k` indicate a triangle.
   - The function does not handle the case where the shape is a triangle with more than two rows.
   - The function does not handle the case where the shape is an upside-down triangle.

4. **Output**: The function prints the list `k` instead of the required "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

To correctly determine the shape, the function should:
- Check if all counts in `k` are equal, which would indicate a square.
- Check if the counts in `k` follow the pattern of a triangle (i.e., 1, 3, 5, ... or 5, 3, 1, ... for an upside-down triangle).

Given these issues, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
