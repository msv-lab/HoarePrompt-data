Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape drawn on the grid is a triangle or a square. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and the size of the grid correctly, but it does not handle the grid input properly. It only appends the count of '1's in each row to the list `k` if the row contains at least one '1'. This means it might not capture the full structure of the shape, especially if the shape is a triangle with a single '1' in the first row.

2. **Shape Determination**: The program checks if the first two elements in the list `k` are equal and prints the list `k` if they are. This is incorrect because:
   - It should print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the shape.
   - The condition `k[0] == k[1]` is not sufficient to determine the shape. For a square, all elements in `k` should be equal, and for a triangle, the elements should follow the pattern of a triangle (i.e., `2*i - 1` for the i-th row).

3. **Output**: The program does not print the correct output format as specified in the problem description. It should print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(n):
        if grid[i].count('1') != 2 * (i + 1) - 1:
            return False
    return True

def is_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(n):
        if grid[i].count('1') != n:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for triangle
        if is_triangle(grid):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        # Check for square
        elif is_square(grid):
            print("SQUARE")
        # Check for upside-down triangle
        elif is_triangle(grid[::-1]):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("SQUARE")

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Defines helper functions `is_triangle` and `is_square` to check if the grid forms a triangle or a square, respectively.
- Handles the input correctly by reading the grid for each test case.
- Checks for both the normal and upside-down triangle.
- Prints the correct output format as specified in the problem description.
