You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is a list of n strings, each string consisting of n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, grid remains a list of n strings, each string consisting of n characters that are either '0' or '1', a remains the same input integer. The list k is populated with the counts of '1's in each input string b, but only if '1' is present in b. If the first two counts in k are equal, k is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid, `n`, and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.
   - It checks if there is at least one '1' in each row and appends the count of '1's in that row to the list `k`.

2. **Shape Determination**:
   - After collecting the counts of '1's in each row, the program checks if the first and second elements of the list `k` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it prints the list `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement.
   - Instead, it prints the list `k` if the first and second elements are equal.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output**:
  - The program does not correctly determine and print whether the shape is a "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".
  - It simply prints the list `k` if the first and second elements are equal, which is not the expected output.

- **Logic Incompleteness**:
  - The program does not handle the logic for determining if the shape is a triangle or a square.
  - It only checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements of the problem statement. It fails to correctly identify and print the shape as "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

### Correctness: **False**
