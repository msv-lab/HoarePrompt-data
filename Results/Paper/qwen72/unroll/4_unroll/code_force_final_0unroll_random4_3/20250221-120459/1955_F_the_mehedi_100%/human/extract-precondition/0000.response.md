Precondition: **The function `func` should take four non-negative integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` as input, where each integer represents the count of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, respectively, and 0 <= p1, p2, p3, p4 <= 200.**

However, the function definition provided is incomplete. It should be:

```python
def func(p1, p2, p3, p4):
```

With the precondition as described above.
