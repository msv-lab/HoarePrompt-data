Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the sequence initially has a bitwise XOR of 0. According to the problem description, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the sequence is 0. However, the program does not correctly account for this scenario in its logic.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
0 0 0 1
```
The sequence contains only one 4, and the bitwise XOR of a single number is the number itself. Since 4 is non-zero, Alice wins in this case. However, the program will output `1` because it adds 1 to `cnt` for the single 4, which is incorrect. Bob should not win in this case, but the program incorrectly counts this as a win for Bob.
