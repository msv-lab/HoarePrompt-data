The function `func` accepts four parameters `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`. Each parameter is a non-negative integer representing the count of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in a sequence, respectively, with the constraint that 0 <= p1, p2, p3, p4 <= 200.

Functionality: **The function accepts four non-negative integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`, each representing the count of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in a sequence, respectively, with the constraint that 0 <= p1, p2, p3, p4 <= 200. The function returns a result based on these counts, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
