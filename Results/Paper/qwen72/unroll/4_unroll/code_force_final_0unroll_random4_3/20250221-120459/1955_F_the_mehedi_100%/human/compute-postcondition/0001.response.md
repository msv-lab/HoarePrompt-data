To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the loop and understand how it affects the variables and the overall state.

### Initial State:
- The function `func` takes four non-negative integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` as input.
- Each integer represents the count of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, respectively.
- The range of these integers is 0 <= p1, p2, p3, p4 <= 200.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
        cnt += 1
    for x in a:
        cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
    print(cnt)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop runs `int(input())` times. This input is the number of test cases or sequences to process.

2. **Loop Body:**
   - For each iteration, a new list `a` is read from the input, which contains four integers.
   - A variable `cnt` is initialized to 0.
   - If all elements in `a` are odd, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
   - For each element `x` in `a`, `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(x / 2)`.
   - The value of `cnt` is printed.

### Output State:
- The variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` are not modified within the loop.
- The loop only reads new inputs and prints the result of the computation for each test case.
- Therefore, the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The output state is the same as the initial state because the loop does not modify the input variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`.

Output State: **The values of p1, p2, p3, and p4 remain unchanged.**
