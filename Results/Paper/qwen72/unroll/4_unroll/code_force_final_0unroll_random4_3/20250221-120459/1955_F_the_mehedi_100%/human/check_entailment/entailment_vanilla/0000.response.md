### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve's goal is to remove numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence can be paired such that each pair XORs to zero.
   - Specifically, the XOR of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are:
     - \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
     - \(2 \oplus 2 = 0\)
     - \(3 \oplus 3 = 0\)
     - \(4 \oplus 4 = 0\)
     - \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0\)
   - Therefore, if the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are all even, the XOR will be zero, and Bob wins.

3. **Initial XOR Calculation**:
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, the initial XOR will be non-zero, and Alice wins.
   - If any of the counts of 1s, 2s, or 3s are even, the initial XOR can be zero, and Bob wins.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s become even as often as possible.
   - Removing pairs of numbers (e.g., two 1s, two 2s, etc.) will keep the XOR zero.
   - Removing one number from an odd count will make that count even, potentially making the XOR zero.

5. **Counting Bob's Wins**:
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd initially, Bob wins once (when Eve removes one number to make one count even).
   - For each pair of numbers removed, Bob wins once.
   - The total number of pairs that can be removed is the sum of the floor division of each count by 2.

6. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
   - It checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If so, it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - It then adds the floor division of each count by 2 to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. It accounts for the initial condition where all counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are odd and the number of pairs that can be removed to keep the XOR zero.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
