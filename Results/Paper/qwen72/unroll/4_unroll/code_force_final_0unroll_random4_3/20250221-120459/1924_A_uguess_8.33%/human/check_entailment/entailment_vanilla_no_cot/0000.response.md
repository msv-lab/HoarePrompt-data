Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**:
   - The program uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters in the string `s`. However, it only checks if all `k` characters have appeared at least once in the string `s` and increments a count `cnt` whenever this condition is met.
   - This approach does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

2. **Incorrect Output for "NO" Case**:
   - The program attempts to construct a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` by using the bitmask `cur` and the count `cnt`. However, the logic for constructing this string is flawed.
   - The program constructs the string by repeating the last character in the bitmask and then appending 'a' characters, which is not a valid way to ensure the string is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the string that is not a subsequence.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

### Example of a Correct Solution:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, pattern):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in pattern)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        all_possible = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
        
        for pattern in all_possible:
            if not is_subsequence(s, pattern):
                print('NO')
                print(pattern)
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:

1. **Generate All Possible Strings**:
   - Use `itertools.product` to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

2. **Check Subsequence**:
   - The function `is_subsequence` checks if a given pattern is a subsequence of `s` by using an iterator and the `all` function.

3. **Output**:
   - Iterate through all possible patterns and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any pattern is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the pattern.
   - If all patterns are subsequences, print "YES".

This approach ensures that the program correctly determines if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s` and provides a valid string if the answer is "NO".
