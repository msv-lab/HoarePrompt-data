The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is not initialized, and it will be set to 0 by the `range(t)` function. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
