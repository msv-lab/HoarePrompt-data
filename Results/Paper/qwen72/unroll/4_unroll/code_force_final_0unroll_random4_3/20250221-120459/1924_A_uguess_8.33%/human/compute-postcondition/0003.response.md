The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function is designed to work with external inputs or variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`. Here, `t` is the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are integers within specified ranges, `m` is the length of the string `s`, and `s` is a string of length `m` that consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function is expected to process these inputs and return a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes a set of inputs including the number of test cases `t`, integers `n` and `k`, the length `m` of a string `s`, and the string `s` itself, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
