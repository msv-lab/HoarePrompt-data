The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` distinct characters from the first `k` alphabets. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If not, the function prints 'NO' followed by a string that includes the missing characters and additional 'a' characters to reach a total of `n` distinct characters. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying the input variables.
