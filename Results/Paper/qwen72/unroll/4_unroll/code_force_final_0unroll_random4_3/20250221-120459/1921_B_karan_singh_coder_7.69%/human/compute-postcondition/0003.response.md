Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `s` and `t` of length `n`, where each character is either '0' or '1'. It then calculates the number of differing characters between `s` and `t` and the number of '1's in each string. If the number of '1's in `s` and `t` is the same, it prints the number of '1's if there are any differing characters; otherwise, it prints 0. If the number of '1's in `s` and `t` is different, it calculates and prints a result based on the difference in the number of '1's and the number of differing characters. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, `s`, and `t` (not `f`) are processed within the loop but are not modified or retained after the function completes. **
