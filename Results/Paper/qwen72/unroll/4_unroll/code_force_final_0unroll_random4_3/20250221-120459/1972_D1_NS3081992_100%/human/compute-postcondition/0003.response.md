To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition step by step:

The loop condition is:
```
while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
```

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
- `i` is 1.
- `ans` is 0.

### Loop Condition Analysis:
1. **First Condition: `i <= m`**
   - Since `i` is 1, this condition will be true if `m` is at least 1. Given that `m` is a positive integer, this condition is already satisfied.

2. **Second Condition: `i * i <= n + i`**
   - Substituting `i = 1` into the condition, we get:
     ```
     1 * 1 <= n + 1
     1 <= n + 1
     0 <= n
     ```
   - Since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6), this condition is also satisfied.

### Conclusion:
Both conditions in the loop head are satisfied with the given initial state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is 1; `ans` is 0**
