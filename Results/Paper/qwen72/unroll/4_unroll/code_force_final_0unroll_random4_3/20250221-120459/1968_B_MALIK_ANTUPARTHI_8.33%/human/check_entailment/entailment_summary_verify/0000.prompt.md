You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `d` and `e` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It reads the number of test cases `a` from the input, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `d`, and `e`. The function then searches for the position in `d` where the next character of `d` is no longer found in the remaining part of `e` starting from the current position. It outputs an integer `k` for each test case, which represents the position in `d` where the search stops. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the binary strings `d` and `e` are not modified by the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the prefix of string `a` is a subsequence of string `b`, but the index `k` in string `b` is not updated correctly. Specifically, the line `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` should be `k = e.index(d[j], k) + 1` to ensure that the search for the next character in `d` starts from the correct position in `e`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 5
10101
11011
```
The expected output is `5` because the entire string `a` is a subsequence of `b`. However, the program will output `3` because it incorrectly updates the index `k` in `b` when searching for the next character in `a`.

The correct implementation should ensure that the search for the next character in `a` starts from the current position `k` in `b` to maintain the subsequence property.
