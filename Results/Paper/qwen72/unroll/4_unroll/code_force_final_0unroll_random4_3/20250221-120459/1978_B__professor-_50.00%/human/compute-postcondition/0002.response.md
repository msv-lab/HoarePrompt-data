Output State: **t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The loop has finished executing t times, and the values of n, a, and b for each test case have been processed according to the conditions in the loop. The output for each test case is printed, and the values of n, a, and b are no longer retained after each iteration.**
