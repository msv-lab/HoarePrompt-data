Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**:
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, then it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is because selling at the modified price would yield less or equal profit.
     - The program correctly prints `n * a` in this case.
   
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, then it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + (b-n+1)`.
     - The sum of the first `n` terms of this series is given by the formula: `n * (2 * b - n + 1) / 2`.
     - The program correctly prints this value.
   
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, then it is optimal to sell the first `b - a + 1` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a + 1)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a + 1` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + a`.
     - The sum of this series is given by the formula: `(b - a + 1) * (b + a) / 2`.
     - The profit from the remaining buns is `(n - (b - a + 1)) * a`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.
     - However, the program incorrectly calculates the total profit as `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. This formula is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the sum of the arithmetic series for the first `b - a + 1` buns.

3. **Output Handling**: The program correctly prints the output for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `b` is very large or very small relative to `a` and `n` correctly.
   - However, the incorrect formula in the third case will fail for certain values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Given the incorrect formula in the third case, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
