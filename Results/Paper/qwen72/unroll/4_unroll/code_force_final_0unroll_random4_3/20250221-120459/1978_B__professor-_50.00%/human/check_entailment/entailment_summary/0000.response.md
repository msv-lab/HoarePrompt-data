### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Conditions and Calculations**:
   - **Case 1**: `b <= a`
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` to maximize profit.
     - The profit is calculated as `n * a`, which is correct.
   - **Case 2**: `b - a >= n`
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`, which is the sum of the first `n` terms of the series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - This formula is correct.
   - **Case 3**: `b - a < n`
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first `b - a + 1` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a + 1)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit is calculated as the sum of the first `b - a + 1` terms of the series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The formula used is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`, but this is incorrect. The correct formula should be `int((b - a + 1) * (b - a + 2) / 2) + a * (n - (b - a + 1))`.

3. **Arithmetic Series Sum**:
   - The sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the common difference is `-1` is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{k \cdot (2b - k + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - For the third case, the number of terms `k` is `b - a + 1`, so the correct formula should be:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{(b - a + 1) \cdot (2b - (b - a + 1) + 1)}{2} = \frac{(b - a + 1) \cdot (b + a)}{2}
     \]
   - The remaining buns are sold at the usual price `a`, so the profit from the remaining buns is:
     \[
     \text{Profit from remaining buns} = a \cdot (n - (b - a + 1))
     \]
   - Therefore, the total profit should be:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \frac{(b - a + 1) \cdot (b + a)}{2} + a \cdot (n - (b - a + 1))
     \]

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because the formula used in the third case is not correctly implemented. The correct formula should be:
\[
\text{Total Profit} = \frac{(b - a + 1) \cdot (b + a)}{2} + a \cdot (n - (b - a + 1))
\]

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            k = b - a + 1
            modified_profit = int(k * (b + a) / 2)
            remaining_profit = a * (n - k)
            print(modified_profit + remaining_profit)
```

This corrected program will correctly calculate the maximum profit for each test case.
