### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, then Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because selling them at the modified price would not increase the profit.
     - The profit in this case is `n * a`.
     - **Example:**
       - `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 3`
       - Expected Output: `4 * 4 = 16`
       - Actual Output: `16` (Correct)

   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, then Bob can sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is given by the formula \(\frac{n \cdot (2b - n + 1)}{2}\).
     - **Example:**
       - `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
       - Expected Output: \(\frac{5 \cdot (2 \cdot 9 - 5 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 14}{2} = 35\)
       - Actual Output: `35` (Correct)

   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, then Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of an arithmetic sequence from `b` to `a + 1`, which is \(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2}\).
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is `a * (n - (b - a))`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.
     - **Example:**
       - `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
       - Expected Output: \(\frac{(5 - 10) \cdot (5 - 10 + 1)}{2} + 10 \cdot (10 - (5 - 10)) = \frac{5 \cdot 6}{2} + 10 \cdot 5 = 15 + 50 = 65\)
       - Actual Output: `100` (Incorrect)

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the function prints the calculated maximum profit.

### Verification:

- **Case 1: `b <= a`**
  - Example: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 3`
  - Expected Output: `4 * 4 = 16`
  - Actual Output: `16` (Correct)

- **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
  - Example: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Expected Output: \(\frac{5 \cdot (2 \cdot 9 - 5 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 14}{2} = 35\)
  - Actual Output: `35` (Correct)

- **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
  - Example: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - Expected Output: \(\frac{(5 - 10) \cdot (5 - 10 + 1)}{2} + 10 \cdot (10 - (5 - 10)) = \frac{5 \cdot 6}{2} + 10 \cdot 5 = 15 + 50 = 65\)
  - Actual Output: `100` (Incorrect)

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect in the third case. The formula used in the third case is not correct. The correct formula should be:
  - \(\text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot (n - (b - a))\)

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            k = b - a
            print(int((k * (k + 1)) // 2 + a * (n - k)))
```

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
