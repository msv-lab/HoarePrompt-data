### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: `b <= a`
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is simply `n * a`.
     - This condition is handled correctly in the program.
   - **Case 2**: `b - a >= n`
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price. The profit is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - The formula used in the program is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`, which is the correct formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of the series.
   - **Case 3**: `b - a < n`
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The formula used in the program is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. However, this formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
       - Sum of the first `b - a` terms of the series: `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2)`
       - Plus the remaining buns sold at the usual price: `a * (n - (b - a))`
       - Therefore, the correct formula should be: `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 + a * (n - (b - a)))`

3. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints the result for each test case based on the conditions.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because the formula used in the third case is wrong. The correct formula should be `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 + a * (n - (b - a)))`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 + a * (n - (b - a))))
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
