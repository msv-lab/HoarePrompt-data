Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is greater than the number of days (`n`) times the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (`m`). This is a critical edge case that the program should handle, but it does not.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 2 7
1 2 3
```
Here, `n = 3`, `m = 2`, and `k = 7`. The program should be able to determine that it is impossible to buy 7 tickets with the given constraints, but it does not handle this case and will produce an incorrect result.

Additionally, the logic for calculating the cost is flawed. The program incorrectly calculates the cost by adding an extra term `m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` which does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements. The correct approach should involve dynamically adjusting the prices based on the number of tickets bought each day and ensuring that the total number of tickets bought equals `k`.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as a greedy algorithm or dynamic programming, to ensure that the minimum cost is calculated while respecting the constraints.
