Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Beautiful Arrays**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive same elements (`minn`). However, it does not correctly handle the condition where an array can be made beautiful by replacing elements as described in the problem statement.
   - The logic for identifying the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It only considers consecutive same elements, which is not sufficient to determine if an array can be made non-beautiful.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle arrays of length 1 or arrays where all elements are the same. For example, in the case where all elements are the same, the program should output `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Incorrect Loop and Condition Handling**:
   - The loop and condition handling are incorrect. The program increments `i` in a way that can skip elements and does not properly check the conditions for making the array non-beautiful.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements.
- Check for the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements such that no valid operation can be performed to make all elements the same.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_elements_to_remove():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # If the array has only one element, it cannot be made non-beautiful
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # If all elements are the same, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Count the number of elements that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                count += 1
        
        # If no such elements exist, the array is already non-beautiful
        if count == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            print(1)

min_elements_to_remove()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Edge Case for Single Element**: If the array has only one element, it cannot be made non-beautiful, so the program outputs `-1`.
- **Edge Case for All Elements the Same**: If all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements, so the program outputs `-1`.
- **Counting Elements to Remove**: The program iterates through the array and counts the number of elements that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful. If no such elements exist, the array is already non-beautiful, and the program outputs `0`. Otherwise, it outputs `1` because removing one such element is sufficient to make the array non-beautiful.

This corrected program should handle all the given test cases correctly.
