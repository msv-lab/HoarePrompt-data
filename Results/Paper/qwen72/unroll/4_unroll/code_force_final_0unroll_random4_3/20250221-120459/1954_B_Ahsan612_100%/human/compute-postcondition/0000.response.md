The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter, and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Since the state before the loop starts mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases, and the loop is iterating over `int(input())`, it can be inferred that `int(input())` should be `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is `t` and that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0 (the loop counter starts at 0), `int(input())` is `t`**
