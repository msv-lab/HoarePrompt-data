Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it outputs the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number in the array `a`. If the array is uniform (all elements are the same) or if no such segment exists, it outputs -1. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are read from input and retain their values for the next test case, while internal variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are reset for each new test case. **
