You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to `func_2()`. Inside the function, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and `n` is the length of `s` (1 <= n <= 10^6). `x` is an integer initialized to -1.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.
        #
        #Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
        #Output:
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters)
        return
        #The program returns `None`.
    #State: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns without any value.
    #State: If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is not equal to -1.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: [s[:x + 1]] [s[x + 1:]] (where [s[:x + 1]] is the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the first character different from `s[0]`, and [s[x + 1:]] is the substring from the position immediately after `x` to the end of `s`)
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: NO
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: - The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions from the precondition.
            #   - The integer `2` is printed directly.
            #
            #Given the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement is:
            #
            #Output:
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: s[:x + 2] ' ' s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] is the substring from the start up to and including the character at index x + 1, and s[x + 2:] is the substring starting from the character at index x + 2 to the end)
        #State: *If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is not equal to -1, and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`. If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, the condition `x == 1 or x == n // 2` is true. Otherwise, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.
    #State: *If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is not equal to -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, then `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, then `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is either 1 or `n // 2` if the condition `x == 1 or x == n // 2` is true, otherwise `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It can either return `None` or return without any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns `None`.

Case_2: The program returns without any value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
