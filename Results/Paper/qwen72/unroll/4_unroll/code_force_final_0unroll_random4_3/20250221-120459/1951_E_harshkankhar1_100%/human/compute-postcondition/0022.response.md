Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string of length `n`.
   - If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character.
   - Otherwise, `x` will remain -1.
   - `x` is not equal to -1, which means there is at least one character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.
   - `x` is not equal to 1.
   - `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.
   - `x` is not 1 and not `n // 2`.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES' because the conditions provided ensure that the string `s` has a specific structure and the function `func_1` returns `True` for the substring starting from `x + 1`.

**Explanation:**
- The string `s` has at least one character different from `s[0]` at an index `x` where `x` is not 1 and not `n // 2`.
- The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True` for the substring starting from `x + 1`.
- Since all conditions are met, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
