Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` if such a character exists. Otherwise, `x` remains -1.
   - `x` is not equal to -1, meaning there is at least one character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
   - `func_1` applied to the substring `s[x + 1:]` returns `False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `2`.
   - The values of `s`, `n`, and `x` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - The condition that `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False` does not affect the `print` statement because it is not part of the `print` statement itself.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, and `x`.

Output: **2**
