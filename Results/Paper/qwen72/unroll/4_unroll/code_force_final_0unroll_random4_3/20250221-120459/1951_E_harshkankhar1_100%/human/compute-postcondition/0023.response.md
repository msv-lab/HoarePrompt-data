Let's break down the precondition and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Precondition Analysis:**
   - `s` is a string.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `x` is a variable that will be set to the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` if such a character exists. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1.
   - It is given that `x` is not equal to -1, meaning there is at least one character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.
   - `x` is not equal to 1.
   - `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the integer `2`.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions from the precondition.
   - The integer `2` is printed directly.

Given the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **2**
