### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads a string `s` from the input and determines if it can be partitioned into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", followed by `1` and the string `s` itself, which is a valid partition.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character.
     - If no such character is found (`x` remains -1), it prints "NO" because the string consists of the same character repeated, and no partition can avoid palindromes.
   - If a different character is found at index `x`, it further checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", followed by `2` and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`:
       - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because the partition would still contain a palindrome.
       - Otherwise, it prints "YES", followed by `2` and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string `s` is a single character, `func_1(s)` will return `True` (since a single character is a palindrome), and the function will print "NO" because no partition can avoid a palindrome.
   - If the string `s` consists of the same character repeated (e.g., "aaaaa"), `func_1(s)` will return `True`, and the function will print "NO" because no partition can avoid a palindrome.
   - If the string `s` has a different character at the second position (e.g., "abaaa"), `func_1(s[1:])` will return `True`, but the function will correctly print "YES" and a valid partition.

4. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem.
   - It ensures that the output is "YES" only if a valid partition exists, and "NO" otherwise.
   - The partitioning logic is sound and covers all possible scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
