Precondition: **The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving an n x n matrix and operations to maximize the sum of its elements, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the matrix size `n` and potentially other inputs as described in the problem.** 

However, based on the problem description, the correct function definition should be:
```
def func_1(t, n_list):
```
Precondition: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and n_list is a list of integers where each integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) represents the size of the matrix a for each test case. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.**
