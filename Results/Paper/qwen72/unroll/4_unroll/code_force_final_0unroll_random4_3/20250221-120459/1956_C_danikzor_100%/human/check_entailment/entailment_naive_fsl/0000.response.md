Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly maximize the sum of the numbers in the matrix as described in the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to fill the matrix with permutations.

The program prints the maximum possible sum, which is correct, and the number of operations, which is also correct (2 * n). However, the permutations used in the operations are not correct for maximizing the sum.

For each operation, the program uses the permutation `range(n, 0, -1)`, which is a descending sequence from `n` to `1`. This permutation is applied to both rows and columns. However, the problem does not specify that the permutations must be the same for both types of operations, and using the same descending permutation for all operations does not necessarily maximize the sum.

To maximize the sum, the matrix should be filled with the highest possible values in each row and column. The correct approach would be to use the permutation `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` for both row and column operations, which ensures that the highest values are used.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
        print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

This corrected version will correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for every potential case.
