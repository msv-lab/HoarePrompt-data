To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions that are part of the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```

This loop iterates over the range from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:

1. `n` must be greater than 0, because if `n` is 0, the range would be from `-1` to `-1`, which is empty, and the loop would not execute.
2. `i` must start at `n - 1` and be decremented down to `0`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000.
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.
- `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros.

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` starts at `n - 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`**
