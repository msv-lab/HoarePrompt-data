You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates t times, where t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each iteration, x and y are integers provided as input, and they satisfy 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: The loop will execute t times, and for each iteration, it will read a new pair of integers (x, y) from the input. If x is greater than y, it will print x followed by y. Otherwise, it will print y followed by x. After all iterations, the values of x and y will be the last pair of integers read from the input, and the loop variable i will be equal to x-1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum of the two integers `x` and `y` as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program prints the larger number first and the smaller number second when `x > y`, which is the opposite of what is required. For example, for the input `1 9`, the program will print `9 1` instead of `1 9`. This violates the problem description, which requires the minimum to be printed first, followed by the maximum.
