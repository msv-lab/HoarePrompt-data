Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum of the two integers `x` and `y` as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program prints the larger number first and the smaller number second when `x > y`, which is the opposite of what is required. For example, for the input `1 9`, the program will print `9 1` instead of `1 9`. This violates the problem description, which requires the minimum to be printed first, followed by the maximum.
