Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` as required by the problem description. The issue lies in the `if` and `else` statements where the values are printed in the wrong order. The program should print the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)
```

This corrected version will ensure that the minimum value is printed first and the maximum value is printed second, as specified in the problem description.
