Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Odd Sum Check**: The function checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because the total points in a series of chess games must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).

3. **High Score Check**: If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `(p1 + p2)`, the function prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because the maximum number of draws that could have happened is when the highest score player has drawn all their games with the other two players, and the other two players have drawn all their games with each other. This ensures that the highest score is consistent with the sum of the other two scores.

4. **Complex Calculation**: If the above conditions are not met, the function enters a more complex calculation:
   - It sets `low` and `high` to the minimum and maximum of the differences `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - It initializes `cur` to `low` and enters a loop where it checks if `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid `cur`, it prints `p3`.

   This part of the logic is more complex and needs careful examination. The goal is to find the maximum number of draws that can be consistent with the given scores. However, the logic here seems to be flawed. Specifically, the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` and the subsequent print statement `p1 - cur + p3` do not seem to correctly account for the maximum number of draws.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the output is `0`, which is correct (no games played).
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the output is `1`, which is correct (one draw between the second and third players).
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the output is `-1`, which is correct (no valid way to achieve these scores).
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the output is `2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` (one draw between the first and second players, and one win for the third player).
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the output is `-1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `3` (three draws between all pairs).
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the output is `6`, which is correct (three draws and three wins/losses).
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the output is `2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `-1` (no valid way to achieve these scores).

Given the analysis, the logic in the complex calculation part is flawed and does not consistently produce the correct maximum number of draws.

Correctness: **False**
