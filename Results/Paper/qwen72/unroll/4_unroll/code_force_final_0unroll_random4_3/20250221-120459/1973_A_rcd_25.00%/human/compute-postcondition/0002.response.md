Output State: **The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed either `-1`, `p1 + p2`, or a value calculated based on the conditions inside the loop. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be updated for each iteration based on the input provided, but these variables will not retain any specific value after the loop completes. The variable `t` will be unchanged.**
