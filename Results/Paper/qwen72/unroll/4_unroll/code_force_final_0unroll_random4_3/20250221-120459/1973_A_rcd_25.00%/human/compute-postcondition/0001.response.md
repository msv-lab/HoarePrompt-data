The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `_` is a placeholder variable**
