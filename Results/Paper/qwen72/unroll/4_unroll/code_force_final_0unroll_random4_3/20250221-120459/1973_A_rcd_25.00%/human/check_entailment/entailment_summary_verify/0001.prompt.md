You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each containing three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of three players in a series of chess games. The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. It prints a result for each test case based on the following conditions: If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1`. If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, it prints `p1 + p2`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a value that satisfies certain conditions within a loop. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not retained. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Initial Check for Validity**:
   - The program first checks if the total sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.

3. **Checking for Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum is even, the program then checks if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it means the highest score could be achieved entirely by draws, and the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`.
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program enters a more complex logic to determine the maximum number of draws.

4. **Complex Logic for Draws**:
   - The program calculates the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores: `low = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)` and `high = max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a value `cur` such that the remaining points after `cur` draws can be distributed in a valid way.
   - The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` checks if the remaining points can be distributed without violating the non-decreasing order of scores.
   - If a valid `cur` is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` as the maximum number of draws.
   - If no valid `cur` is found, it prints `p3`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Sum Check**: The sum of the scores must be even, which is correctly checked.
- **Maximum Draws for `p3 >= p1 + p2`**: This condition is correct because if the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores, all games could have ended in draws.
- **Complex Logic for `p3 < p1 + p2`**:
  - The logic for finding the maximum number of draws is more complex and involves iterating through possible values of `cur`.
  - The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining points can be distributed in a way that maintains the non-decreasing order of scores.
  - However, the logic for printing the result `p1 - cur + p3` is incorrect. The correct result should be `cur + (p1 + p2 - p3) // 2`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(cur + (p1 + p2 - p3) // 2)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the way it calculates the maximum number of draws when `p3 < p1 + p2`.
- The corrected program should print `cur + (p1 + p2 - p3) // 2` instead of `p1 - cur + p3`.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
