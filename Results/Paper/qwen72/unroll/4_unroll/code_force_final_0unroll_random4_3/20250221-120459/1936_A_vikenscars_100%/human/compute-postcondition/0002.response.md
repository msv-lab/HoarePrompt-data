To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the loop step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4.
- `max_item_idx` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    ans = func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)
    if ans == '<':
        max_item_idx = i
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
2. In each iteration, `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` is called, and the result is stored in `ans`.
3. If `ans` is equal to '<', then `max_item_idx` is updated to `i`.

### Key Points:
- The function `func_1` is not defined in the problem, but we can infer its behavior based on the condition `ans == '<'`.
- The condition `ans == '<'` suggests that `func_1` is comparing something and returning a string '<' if the comparison is true.
- Since `max_item_idx` starts at 0, and the loop starts from `i = 1`, the first comparison will be between `max_item_idx = 0` and `i = 1`.
- If `func_1` returns '<' for the first comparison, `max_item_idx` will be updated to 1.
- This process continues, and `max_item_idx` will be updated to the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returns '<'.

### Conclusion:
- If `func_1` always returns '<' for any `i` in the range 1 to `n-1`, then `max_item_idx` will be updated to `n-1` by the end of the loop.
- If `func_1` never returns '<', then `max_item_idx` will remain 0.
- If `func_1` returns '<' for some values of `i` and not for others, `max_item_idx` will be the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<'.

### Output State:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `max_item_idx` will be the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' during the loop execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' during the loop execution.**
