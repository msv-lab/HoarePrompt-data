To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```
for i in range(n):
```

The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4
- `max_item_idx` is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' during the loop execution
- `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Since `n` is already within the range of 2 to 10^4, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed for `n`. However, we need to initialize `i` to 0 for the loop to start correctly.

The state of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the sake of completeness and to ensure the loop can start, we should specify the initial state of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' during the loop execution, `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`, `i` is 0**
