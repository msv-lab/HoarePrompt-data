The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, each less than the length of the permutation `p`. It prints a formatted string `? a b c d` to the console and then returns the user's input as a string. The final state of the program is that the formatted string has been printed, and the function has returned the user's input, which can be any string.
