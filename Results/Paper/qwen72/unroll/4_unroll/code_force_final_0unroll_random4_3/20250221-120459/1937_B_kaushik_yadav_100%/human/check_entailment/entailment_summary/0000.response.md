Reasoning:

1. **String Construction**:
   - The function constructs the lexicographically smallest string by starting at the top-left cell (1, 1) and choosing the next cell based on the comparison of the current cell in `a` and the next cell in `a` and `b`.
   - The variable `work` is used to decide whether to take the next character from `a` or `b`. Initially, it is set to `True`, meaning the grasshopper starts by moving right in the first row.
   - If the current character in `b` is lexicographically smaller than the next character in `a`, the grasshopper moves down to `b` and continues moving right in `b`.
   - If the current character in `b` is not smaller, the grasshopper continues moving right in `a`.
   - This logic ensures that the constructed string `ans` is lexicographically smallest.

2. **Path Counting**:
   - The function then counts the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It initializes a `counter` to 1, which represents the number of paths.
   - It iterates through the strings `a` and `b` to check for consecutive matching characters.
   - If the next character in `a` matches the current character in `b`, it increments the `counter`.
   - If the next character in `a` is '0' and the current character in `b` is '1', it resets the `counter` to 1.
   - If the characters do not match, it breaks the loop, as the path is no longer valid for the lexicographically smallest string.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 2.
   - It also handles the case where the grasshopper must move down to `b` to continue the path.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string for each test case.
   - The output format matches the problem description.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The function processes each test case in linear time, which is efficient given the constraints.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
