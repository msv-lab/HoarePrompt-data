You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of columns in the 2 × n grid, and two binary strings of length n representing the values in the first and second rows of the grid. The function should also handle up to 10^4 test cases, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, `ans` will contain the constructed string, and `counter` will hold the count of consecutive matching characters or the count reset to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `counter` will be the result of the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a string `ans` by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on certain conditions, and then prints `ans`. It also calculates a `counter` that tracks the number of consecutive matching characters between `a` and `b` or resets to 1 if the conditions are not met, and prints `counter`. The function handles up to 10^4 test cases, with the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the final state includes the printed results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by a grasshopper jumping from the top-left cell (1, 1) to the bottom-right cell (2, n) in a 2 × n grid.
   - We also need to count the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and two binary strings `a` and `b` representing the two rows of the grid.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the lexicographically smallest string and a boolean `work` to determine the current row the grasshopper is on (initially on the first row).

3. **String Construction:**
   - The program iterates through the columns of the grid.
   - If `work` is `True`, it adds the character from the first row `a[i]` to `ans`.
   - If the next character in the second row `b[i]` is lexicographically smaller than the next character in the first row `a[i + 1]`, it switches to the second row by setting `work` to `False`.
   - If the grasshopper is on the second row (`work` is `False`), it adds the character from the second row `b[i]` to `ans`.

4. **Path Counting:**
   - The program initializes a counter `counter` to 1, representing the initial path.
   - It iterates through the columns to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - If the characters in the next column of the first row `a[j + 1]` and the current column of the second row `b[j]` are the same, it increments the counter.
   - If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
   - If the characters differ and `a[j + 1]` is '1' and `b[j]` is '0', it breaks the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `ans`.
   - It prints the number of paths that yield this string.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **String Construction:**
  - The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest string by always choosing the smaller character between the current column of the first row and the next column of the second row.
  - This ensures that the string is as small as possible at each step.

- **Path Counting:**
  - The path counting logic is correct. It counts the number of paths by checking if the characters in the next column of the first row and the current column of the second row are the same.
  - If they are the same, it increments the counter.
  - If they differ and the next column of the first row is '0' and the current column of the second row is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
  - If they differ and the next column of the first row is '1' and the current column of the second row is '0', it breaks the loop, as this indicates that the path cannot continue to yield the lexicographically smallest string.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where the grid is 2 × 2 correctly.
  - It also handles the case where the grasshopper needs to switch rows correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.

Correctness: **True**
