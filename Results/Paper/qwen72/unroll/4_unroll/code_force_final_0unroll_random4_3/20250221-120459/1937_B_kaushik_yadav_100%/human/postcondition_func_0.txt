The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a string `ans` by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on certain conditions, and then prints `ans`. It also calculates a `counter` that tracks the number of consecutive matching characters between `a` and `b` or resets to 1 if the conditions are not met, and prints `counter`. The function handles up to 10^4 test cases, with the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the final state includes the printed results for each test case.
