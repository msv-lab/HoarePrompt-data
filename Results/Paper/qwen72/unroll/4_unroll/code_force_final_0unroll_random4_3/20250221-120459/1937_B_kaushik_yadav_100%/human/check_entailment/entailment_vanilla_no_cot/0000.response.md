Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Path Selection Logic**:
   - The program attempts to build the lexicographically smallest string by always choosing the top row (`a`) until it encounters a situation where the next cell in the bottom row (`b`) is lexicographically smaller than the next cell in the top row (`a`). However, this logic is not entirely correct.
   - The program should always choose the path that results in the lexicographically smallest string, which means it should consider both the current and the next cells in both rows to make the best decision.

2. **Path Counting Logic**:
   - The program's method for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. It increments the `counter` based on the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, but this does not correctly account for all possible paths that can yield the same string.
   - The correct approach should involve dynamic programming or a more sophisticated method to count the number of valid paths that result in the lexicographically smallest string.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. **Find the Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - Start from the top-left cell and always choose the path that results in the lexicographically smallest string. This means you should compare the current and next cells in both rows and choose the path that gives the smallest value.

2. **Count the Number of Paths**:
   - Use dynamic programming to count the number of valid paths that result in the lexicographically smallest string. You need to keep track of the number of ways to reach each cell in the grid while maintaining the lexicographically smallest string.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def find_lexicographically_smallest_path(a, b):
    n = len(a)
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if i == 0:
            ans += a[i]
            i += 1
            continue
        if a[i] < b[i]:
            ans += a[i]
        elif b[i] < a[i]:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
            continue
        else:
            # If a[i] == b[i], choose the path that allows the smallest string in the future
            if i + 1 < n and a[i + 1] < b[i + 1]:
                ans += a[i]
            else:
                ans += b[i]
                i += 1
                continue
        i += 1
    return ans

def count_paths(a, b, smallest_string):
    n = len(a)
    dp = [[0, 0] for _ in range(n)]
    dp[0][0] = 1  # Starting from the top-left cell

    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] == smallest_string[i]:
            dp[i][0] += dp[i-1][0]
        if b[i] == smallest_string[i]:
            dp[i][1] += dp[i-1][1]
        if a[i] == b[i] and a[i] == smallest_string[i]:
            dp[i][1] += dp[i-1][0]

    return dp[n-1][0] + dp[n-1][1]

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        
        smallest_string = find_lexicographically_smallest_path(a, b)
        print(smallest_string)
        
        path_count = count_paths(a, b, smallest_string)
        print(path_count)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **`find_lexicographically_smallest_path`**: This function constructs the lexicographically smallest string by comparing the current and next cells in both rows and choosing the path that results in the smallest string.
- **`count_paths`**: This function uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid paths that result in the lexicographically smallest string. The `dp` array keeps track of the number of ways to reach each cell in the grid while maintaining the smallest string.

This approach ensures that the program correctly finds the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string.
