The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of columns in a 2 × n grid, and two binary strings of length `n` representing the values in the first and second rows of the grid. The function should also handle up to 10^4 test cases, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings of length `n`. It returns a result for each test case based on the values in the 2 × n grid, handling up to 10^4 test cases with the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5.**
