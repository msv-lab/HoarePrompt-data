Precondition: **The function `func_2` does not take any parameters, but it reads input from the standard input. The input is expected to be a series of test cases, each describing a tree. The first integer read is `n`, which represents the number of vertices in the tree, such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. The subsequent `n - 1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` (1 <= u, v <= n, u != v), representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v` in the tree.**
