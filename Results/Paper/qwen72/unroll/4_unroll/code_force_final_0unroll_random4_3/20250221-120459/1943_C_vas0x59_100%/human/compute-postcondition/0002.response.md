The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree and must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `_` is not relevant before the loop starts**
