Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game's rules for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

### Test Case:
```
Input:
1
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```

### Expected Output:
```
2
```

### Actual Output:
The program will output `0`.

### Explanation:
- **Alice's Optimal Move:** Alice can remove the smallest element, which is `1`. The array becomes `[3, 2, 4]`.
- **Bob's Optimal Move:** Bob can then multiply the smallest element of the remaining array by `-1`, which is `2`. The array becomes `[3, -2, 4]`.
- **Final Sum:** The sum of the array is `3 + (-2) + 4 = 5`.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the sum as `0` because it does not correctly handle the removal and negation steps in an optimal manner.

The program should consider the following:
1. Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.
2. Bob should negate the smallest elements of the remaining array to minimize the sum.

The provided program does not follow this optimal strategy, leading to incorrect results for some cases.
