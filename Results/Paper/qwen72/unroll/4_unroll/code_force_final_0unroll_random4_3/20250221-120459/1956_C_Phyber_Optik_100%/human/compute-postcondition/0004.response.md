Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of a matrix. The function calculates a sum based on a series and prints the sum along with `2 * n`. It then prints a series of lines for each `j` from 1 to `n`, where each line starts with either `1` or `2`, followed by `n - j + 1` and the range from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it produces the specified output for each test case. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
