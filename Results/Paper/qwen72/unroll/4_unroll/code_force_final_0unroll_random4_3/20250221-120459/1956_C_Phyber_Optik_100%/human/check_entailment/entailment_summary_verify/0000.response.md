### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summary in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \).
- We can perform up to \( 2n \) operations of two types: row-wise and column-wise permutations.
- The maximum possible sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula:
     ```python
     sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
     ```
   - Simplifying the formula inside the loop:
     \[
     i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the sum calculation becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i
     \]
   - This formula is not the correct way to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix. The correct sum should be:
     \[
     \text{sum} = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
   - For \( n = 2 \), the correct sum is:
     \[
     2 \times \frac{2(2+1)}{2} = 2 \times 3 = 6
     \]
   - The program outputs 7 for \( n = 2 \), which is incorrect.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program prints operations for both rows and columns:
     ```python
     print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```
   - These operations apply the same permutation to each row and column, which does not necessarily maximize the sum. For example, for \( n = 2 \), the operations will result in the matrix:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 \\
     1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The sum of this matrix is 6, which is correct, but the program incorrectly states the maximum sum as 7.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case.
- It calculates a sum using the incorrect formula and prints the sum along with \( 2n \) operations.
- The operations are printed in a way that applies the same permutation to each row and column, which is not optimal for maximizing the sum.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the maximum sum and the operations applied do not always maximize the sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
