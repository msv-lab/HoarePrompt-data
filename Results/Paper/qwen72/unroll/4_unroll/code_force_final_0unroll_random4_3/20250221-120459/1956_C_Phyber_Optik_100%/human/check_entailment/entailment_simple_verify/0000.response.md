### Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the annotated code to determine if the program is correct or not.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
- The operations involve setting a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

#### Original Assessment Recap:
- The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because:
  1. The sum calculation is incorrect.
  2. The operations applied do not maximize the sum.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula:
     ```python
     sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
     ```
   - This formula simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{sum} += (2i - 1) \times i = 2i^2 - i
     \]
   - The total sum for \( n \) is:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - This is not the correct formula for the maximum possible sum. The correct formula for the maximum sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) is:
     \[
     \text{sum} = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
   - For example, for \( n = 2 \):
     \[
     \text{sum} = 2 \times \frac{2(2+1)}{2} = 2 \times 3 = 6
     \]
   - The program outputs 7 for \( n = 2 \), which is incorrect.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program applies the same permutation to both rows and columns:
     ```python
     print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```
   - This results in a matrix where each row and each column is the same permutation, which is not necessarily the optimal way to maximize the sum.
   - For \( n = 2 \), the operations result in the matrix:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 \\
     1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
     - The sum of this matrix is 6, which is correct, but the program incorrectly states the sum as 7.

#### Correct Operations for Maximizing the Sum:
- To maximize the sum, each element in the matrix should be a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).
- One way to achieve this is to use the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) for both rows and columns, ensuring that the highest values are distributed evenly across the matrix.

#### Example for \( n = 2 \):
- Correct operations:
  - Type 1 operation on row 1: \( [2, 1] \)
  - Type 1 operation on row 2: \( [2, 1] \)
  - Type 2 operation on column 1: \( [2, 1] \)
  - Type 2 operation on column 2: \( [2, 1] \)
- Resulting matrix:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 \\
  2 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- Sum: \( 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6 \)

#### Conclusion:
- The sum calculation in the program is incorrect.
- The operations applied do not always maximize the sum.
- The program outputs an incorrect sum for \( n = 2 \) and potentially other values of \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**. The program is incorrect based on the issues identified in the sum calculation and the operations applied.
