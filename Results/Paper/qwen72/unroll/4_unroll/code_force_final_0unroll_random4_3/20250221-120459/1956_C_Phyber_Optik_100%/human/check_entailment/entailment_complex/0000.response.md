Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula `sum = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`.
   - Simplifying the expression inside the sum: \( i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1 \).
   - Therefore, the sum becomes: \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) * i \).
   - This can be further simplified to: \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \).
   - The sum of \( 2i^2 \) from 2 to n is \( 2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 \), and the sum of \( i \) from 2 to n is \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} i \).
   - The sum of \( i^2 \) from 1 to n is \( \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} \), so the sum from 2 to n is \( \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} - 1 \).
   - The sum of \( i \) from 1 to n is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), so the sum from 2 to n is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 1 \).
   - Therefore, the sum \( 1 + 2 \left( \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} - 1 \right) - \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 1 \right) \).

2. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the sum and `2 * n` as required.
   - It then prints `n` operations of type 1 and `n` operations of type 2, each using the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Operations**:
   - The operations are performed on the matrix such that each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix is filled with a value from 1 to n, and the sum of the matrix is maximized.

4. **Maximum Sum**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \), which is the sum of all elements in the matrix if each element is filled with a value from 1 to n.
   - The program's sum calculation should match this maximum sum.

5. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program uses exactly `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the operations in the required format and within the allowed number of operations.

Correctness: **True**
