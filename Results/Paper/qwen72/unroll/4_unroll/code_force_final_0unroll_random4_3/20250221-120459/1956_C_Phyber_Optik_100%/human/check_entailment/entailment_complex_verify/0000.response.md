Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the sum calculation in the program is flawed. The formula used:
     ```python
     sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
     ```
     simplifies to:
     ```python
     sum += (2 * i - 1) * i
     ```
     which is:
     ```python
     sum += 2 * i^2 - i
     ```
     This formula does not match the correct sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \). The correct sum should be:
     \[
     n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
     For \( n = 2 \), the correct sum is \( 2 \times (1 + 2) = 6 \), but the program outputs 7. This is clearly incorrect.

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations applied in the program are also not optimal for maximizing the sum. The program assigns the same permutation to both rows and columns, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, for \( n = 2 \), the operations:
     ```python
     print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```
     will result in the matrix:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 \\
     1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
     which has a sum of 6, but the program incorrectly outputs 7 as the maximum sum.

   - The correct approach to maximize the sum is to ensure that each element in the matrix is the maximum possible value, which is \( n \). This can be achieved by applying the operations in such a way that each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \). For example, for \( n = 2 \), the correct operations could be:
     - Type 1 operation on row 1: \( [2, 1] \)
     - Type 1 operation on row 2: \( [2, 1] \)
     - Type 2 operation on column 1: \( [2, 1] \)
     - Type 2 operation on column 2: \( [2, 1] \)

     This results in the matrix:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     2 & 1 \\
     2 & 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
     which has a sum of 6, the maximum possible sum for \( n = 2 \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the maximum sum and the operations applied do not always maximize the sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
