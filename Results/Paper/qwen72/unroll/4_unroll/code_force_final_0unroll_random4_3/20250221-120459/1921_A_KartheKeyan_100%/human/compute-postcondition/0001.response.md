Output State: **The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The function should take a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and there is exactly one square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area for each test case. `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer input provided.
- The initial state information about `t`, the test cases, and the coordinates remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` is now an input integer, and its previous value of 0 is no longer valid.
