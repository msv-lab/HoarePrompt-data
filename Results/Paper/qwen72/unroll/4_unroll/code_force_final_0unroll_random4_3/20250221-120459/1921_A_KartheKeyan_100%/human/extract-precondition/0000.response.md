Precondition: **The function should take a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and there is exactly one square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area for each test case. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**

Here's the function definition with the precondition included:
