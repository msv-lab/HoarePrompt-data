You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500), where |s| denotes the length of the string `s`. The string `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read a binary string `s` from the input. After processing `s`, it will print the number of transitions between different bits in `s` (i.e., '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'). If there are no transitions from '0' to '1', it will print the number of transitions plus one. The variables `s`, `count`, and `flag` will be reset for each iteration, so their final values will be the result of the last iteration. The variable `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a binary string `s` from the input. It then calculates the number of transitions between different bits in `s` (i.e., '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'). If there are no transitions from '0' to '1', it prints the number of transitions plus one; otherwise, it prints the number of transitions. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The variable `t` remains unchanged after the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks to find the minimum number of pieces a binary string can be cut into so that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string. A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading a binary string `s`.

3. **Logic for Counting Pieces**:
   - The program initializes `count` to 0, which will be used to count the number of cuts needed.
   - It also initializes `flag` to 0, which will be used to check if the string is already sorted (i.e., no '0' comes after a '1').

4. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
   - For each character, it checks if the current character `s[i]` is different from the next character `s[i + 1]`.
     - If they are different, it increments `count` by 1, indicating a cut is needed.
   - It also checks if the current character `s[i]` is less than the next character `s[i + 1]`.
     - If this condition is true, it sets `flag` to 1, indicating that the string is not already sorted.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop, if `flag` is still 0, it means the string is already sorted, and the program prints `count + 1` (since no cuts are needed, the entire string is one piece).
   - If `flag` is 1, it means the string is not sorted, and the program prints `count` (the number of cuts needed).

6. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic for counting cuts is correct. Each time two adjacent characters are different, a cut is needed.
   - However, the logic for determining the output is flawed. If the string is already sorted, the program should print 1, not `count + 1`. If the string is not sorted, the program should print `count + 1` because the last piece is not counted in the loop.

7. **Fixing the Logic**:
   - The correct logic should be:
     - If `flag` is 0, print 1 (the string is already sorted).
     - If `flag` is 1, print `count + 1` (the number of cuts plus the last piece).

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the output correctly for sorted strings.

Correctness: **False**
