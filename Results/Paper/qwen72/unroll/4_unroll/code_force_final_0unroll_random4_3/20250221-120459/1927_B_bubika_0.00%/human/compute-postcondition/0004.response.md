The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The function is expected to process these inputs and return a suitable string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z, where the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5), and `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 <= a_i < n). It returns a suitable string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z, based on the input parameters.**
