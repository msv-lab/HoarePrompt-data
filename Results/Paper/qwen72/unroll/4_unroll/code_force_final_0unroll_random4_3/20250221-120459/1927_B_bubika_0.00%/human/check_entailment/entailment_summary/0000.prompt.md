Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

# Program:
def func():
    a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    b = [0] * 26
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        r = ''
        for i in s:
            x = b.index(i)
            r += a[x]
            b[x] += 1
        print(r)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `s`. It then constructs a string `r` by mapping each integer in `s` to a corresponding character in the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' and increments a count for each character used. The function prints the constructed string `r` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` is the last read positive integer (1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5), `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `b` is a list of 26 integers representing the counts of how many times each character in `a` was appended to `r` in the loop.
