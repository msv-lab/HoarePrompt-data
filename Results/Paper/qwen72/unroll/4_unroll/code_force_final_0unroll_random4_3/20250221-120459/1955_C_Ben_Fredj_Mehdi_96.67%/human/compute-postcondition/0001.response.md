The only objects in the loop head are the variable `z` and the input integer `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since `t` is already given as an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`. However, the initial state of `z` needs to be set to 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `z` is 0**
