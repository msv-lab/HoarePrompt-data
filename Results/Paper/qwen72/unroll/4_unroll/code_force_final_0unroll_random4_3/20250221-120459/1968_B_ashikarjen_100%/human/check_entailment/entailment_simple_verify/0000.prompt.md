You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Output

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

    #State: `k` is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the order they appear, and `j` is the index in `b` where the last match was found or where the loop stopped if no more matches were found.

    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the order they appear)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case individually. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes \( k \) (the maximum length of the prefix) and \( j \) (the index in string \( b \)) to 0.

3. **Loop Through String \( a \)**: It iterates through each character of string \( a \) using a for loop.

4. **Find Matching Character in String \( b \)**: For each character in string \( a \), it uses a while loop to find the next matching character in string \( b \). If a match is found, it increments \( k \) and moves the index \( j \) to the next position in string \( b \).

5. **Break Condition**: If the end of string \( b \) is reached without finding a match for the current character in string \( a \), the program breaks out of the loop, ensuring that \( k \) is the maximum length of the prefix that forms a subsequence in \( b \).

6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of \( k \) for each test case.

The program handles edge cases such as:
- When string \( a \) is longer than string \( b \).
- When string \( b \) does not contain any characters from string \( a \).
- When the entire string \( a \) is a subsequence of string \( b \).

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to be correct and should work for all valid inputs.
