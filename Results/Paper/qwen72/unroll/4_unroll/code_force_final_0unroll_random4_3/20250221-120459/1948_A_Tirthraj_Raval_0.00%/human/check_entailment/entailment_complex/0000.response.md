Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem as described. It checks if the number of special characters `n` is even. If `n` is odd, it correctly prints 'NO' because it's impossible to construct a string with an odd number of special characters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. If `n` is even, it constructs a string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B' (or 'B' and 'A'), ensuring that every character is a special character. The pattern generated is valid and meets the problem's requirements. The string length is at most `n`, which is within the allowed limit of 200 characters. The function handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
