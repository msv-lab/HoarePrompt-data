### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Check**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. Special characters must come in pairs (e.g., 'AA', 'BB') to satisfy the condition.

3. **Even `n` Check**:
   - If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES'.
   - It then constructs a pattern of length `n` by alternating between 'A' and 'B'. The pattern is constructed using a loop that runs `n // 2` times, appending two characters in each iteration:
     - `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])` appends 'A' or 'B' based on the parity of `i`.
     - `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])` appends the opposite character ('B' if the previous was 'A', and vice versa).

4. **Pattern Construction**:
   - The pattern construction ensures that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, which satisfies the condition for special characters.
   - The pattern is then joined into a single string and printed.

5. **Output Length**:
   - The length of the constructed string is `n`, which is at most 200 for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

6. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function `func`. It correctly states that the function processes multiple test cases, checks if `n` is odd or even, and constructs a pattern string if `n` is even.
   - The summary also mentions that the function does not return any value, which is consistent with the code.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks for the possibility of constructing a valid string, and constructs the string as required. The output is also within the specified constraints. The function summary and the original assessment are both accurate.

Final: **True**
