The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `n` and `k` are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted here. However, the loop will execute based on the user input, which should be a positive integer to ensure the loop runs at least once.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
