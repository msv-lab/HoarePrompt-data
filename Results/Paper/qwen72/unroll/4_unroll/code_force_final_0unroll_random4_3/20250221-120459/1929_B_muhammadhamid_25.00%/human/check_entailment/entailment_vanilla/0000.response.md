### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The grid has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total (both main and anti-diagonals).

2. **Special Case for \( k = 1 \):**
   - If \( k = 1 \), we only need to color one cell to satisfy the condition. This is correct because any single cell will be part of at least one diagonal.

3. **Case for \( k \leq 2n \):**
   - If \( k \leq 2n \), we can color cells along the main diagonal or the anti-diagonal. Each cell on these diagonals will cover exactly two diagonals (one main and one anti).
   - Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). This is because each cell covers two diagonals, and if \( k \) is odd, we need one extra cell to cover the remaining diagonal.

4. **Case for \( k > 2n \):**
   - If \( k > 2n \), we need to cover more than \( 2n \) diagonals. The main and anti-diagonals can cover up to \( 2n \) diagonals.
   - To cover the remaining \( k - 2n \) diagonals, we need to color additional cells. Each additional cell will cover exactly two new diagonals.
   - The formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) is used to calculate the number of cells needed. This is because:
     - \( k // 2 \) gives the number of cells needed to cover \( k \) diagonals if each cell covers two diagonals.
     - Adding 1 ensures that we cover the remaining diagonal if \( k \) is odd.

5. **Verification of the Formula:**
   - For \( k \leq 2n \), the formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) is correct.
   - For \( k > 2n \), the formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) is correct because it ensures that we cover the remaining diagonals after covering \( 2n \) diagonals with the main and anti-diagonals.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases and outputs the minimum number of cells needed to be colored for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
