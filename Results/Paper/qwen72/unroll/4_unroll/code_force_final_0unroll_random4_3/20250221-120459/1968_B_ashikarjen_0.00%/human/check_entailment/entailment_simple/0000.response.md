Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the function:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, which represent the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `k` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0, which will be used to track the current position in string `b`.

3. **Loop Through `a`**:
   - The function iterates through each character of string `a` using the index `i`.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it searches for a matching character in `b` starting from position `j`.
   - If a match is found, `k` is incremented, and `j` is moved to the next position in `b`.
   - If no match is found (i.e., `j` reaches the end of `b`), the loop breaks.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the function prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

The function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`. It handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement, including cases where `b` does not contain any '1' characters.

Correctness: **True**
