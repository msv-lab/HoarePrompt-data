### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - It also calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program determines the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - If the number of 2x2 icons is even, the number of screens required is `y // 2`.
   - If the number of 2x2 icons is odd, the number of screens required is `y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the remaining cells on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).

5. **Screen Calculation for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), the program appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons (`extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`), where `extra_space` is the space still needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - The total number of screens required is the sum of the screens needed for the 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, each on a new line.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
- The program then correctly calculates the remaining cells available on these screens.
- The program checks if the remaining cells are sufficient for the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where there are no icons or only one type of icon.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons, considering both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
**True**
