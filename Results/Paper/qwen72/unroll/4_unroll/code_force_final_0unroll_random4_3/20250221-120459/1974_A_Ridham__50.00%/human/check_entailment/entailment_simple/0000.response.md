### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - It then calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons and appends the result to a list `result`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, one per line.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The total space required for 1x1 icons is `space_x = x * 1`.
   - The total space required for 2x2 icons is `space_y = y * 4`.
   - The total space required is `total_space = space_x + space_y`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - If the number of 2x2 icons `y` is even, the number of screens required for them is `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons is calculated as `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **1x1 Icons Placement**:
   - If the space required for 1x1 icons `space_x` is less than or equal to the remaining space `remaining_cells`, the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If `space_x` exceeds `remaining_cells`, the extra space required is `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
   - The number of extra screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is calculated as `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`.

6. **Final Result**:
   - The total number of screens required is the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.
- It also correctly calculates the remaining space on these screens.
- The program then checks if the remaining space is sufficient for the 1x1 icons and calculates the additional screens needed if it is not.
- The logic for calculating the extra screens needed for 1x1 icons is correct, as it accounts for the remaining space and the total space required for the 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given problem description and the provided test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
