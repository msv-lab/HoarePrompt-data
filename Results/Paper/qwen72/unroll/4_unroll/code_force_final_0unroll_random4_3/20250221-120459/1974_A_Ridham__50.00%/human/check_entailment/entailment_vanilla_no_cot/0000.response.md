Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the number of extra screens needed for the 1x1 icons after accounting for the 2x2 icons.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. If `y` is even, it needs `y // 2` screens. If `y` is odd, it needs `y // 2 + 1` screens.
   - This part is correct.

2. **Calculation of Remaining Cells**:
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This is incorrect because the total number of cells in `screen_require_for_y` screens is `15 * screen_require_for_y`, but the program should subtract the space occupied by both 2x2 and 1x1 icons, not just the 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculation of Extra Screens for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the extra space needed for 1x1 icons as `space_x - remaining_cells`.
   - If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, it calculates `extra_screen` as `space_x // 15`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates `extra_screen` as `extra_space // 15 + 1`.
   - This part is also flawed because it should consider the total space available in the screens already allocated for 2x2 icons before calculating the extra screens needed.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        total_cells = 15
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 1) // 2  # Number of screens required for 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = total_cells * screens_for_2x2 - (y * 4)  # Remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        if x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screens_for_2x2)
        else:
            extra_cells_needed = x - remaining_cells
            extra_screens = (extra_cells_needed + total_cells - 1) // total_cells  # Ceiling division
            result.append(screens_for_2x2 + extra_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Screens for 2x2 Icons**: The number of screens required for 2x2 icons is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This ensures that if `y` is odd, one extra screen is used.
- **Remaining Cells**: The remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons are calculated as `total_cells * screens_for_2x2 - (y * 4)`.
- **Extra Screens for 1x1 Icons**: If the remaining cells are not enough to place all 1x1 icons, the extra screens needed are calculated using ceiling division: `(extra_cells_needed + total_cells - 1) // total_cells`.

This corrected program should handle all test cases correctly.
