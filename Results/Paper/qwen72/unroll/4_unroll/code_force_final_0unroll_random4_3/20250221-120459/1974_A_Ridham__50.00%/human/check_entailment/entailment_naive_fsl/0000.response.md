Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons (y) is such that they do not completely fill the screens, but the remaining space is not used efficiently for 1x1 icons (x). For example, if the input is `1 2`, the program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `1` because the 2x2 icons can be placed on a single screen, and there will be enough space for the 1x1 icon.

Here is the input that fails:
```
1
1 2
```
The program outputs:
```
2
```
But the correct output should be:
```
1
```
This is because a single screen can accommodate two 2x2 icons and still have one cell left for a 1x1 icon. The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens required.
