You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: The values of `n` and `k` will be the last values read from the input in the final iteration of the loop. The value of `t` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge.
   - Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.
   - Everule starts on island 1 and can visit any island that is still connected to island 1 through a series of bridges.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `k` is 0, no bridges are destroyed, and Everule can visit all `n` islands.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, leaving Everule with only island 1 to visit.
   - If `k` is less than `n - 1`, Dominater can only destroy some of the bridges connected to island 1, but not all. This means Everule can still visit at least `n - k` islands, including island 1.

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
     - If `k >= n - 1`, it prints `1`, which is correct because Everule can only visit island 1.
     - If `k < n - 1`, it prints `n - 1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `n - k` because Everule can still visit `n - k` islands, including island 1.

4. **Correct Output:**
   - For `k < n - 1`, the number of islands Everule can visit is `n - k`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is incorrect because it prints `n - 1` instead of `n - k` when `k < n - 1`.
