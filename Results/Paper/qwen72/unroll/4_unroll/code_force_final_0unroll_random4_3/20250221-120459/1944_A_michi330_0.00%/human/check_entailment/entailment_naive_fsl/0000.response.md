Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n - 1` but still significant enough to isolate some islands. For example, consider the case where `n = 5` and `k = 3`. According to the problem description, Dominater should destroy bridges optimally to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit. The program outputs `n - 1` (which is 4 in this case), but it should output 2 because Dominater can destroy the bridges between island 1 and the other islands, effectively isolating island 1 from the rest. 

The optimal strategy for Dominater is to destroy bridges connected to island 1 first, and the program should account for this. The correct output for the case `n = 5` and `k = 3` should be 2, not 4.
