The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num_tests` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000), which already ensures that the loop will execute at least once. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000), and the function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or another method not defined in the function signature. The input should consist of multiple test cases, each with a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, followed by a list of `n` positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.**
