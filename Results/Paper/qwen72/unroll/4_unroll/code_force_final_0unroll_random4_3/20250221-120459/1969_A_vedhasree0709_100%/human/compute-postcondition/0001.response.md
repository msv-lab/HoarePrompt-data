Output State: **For each test case, the loop will either print 2 if it finds a pair (i, p) such that l[p - 1] == i + 1, or it will print 3 if no such pair is found. The variables t, n, and l will retain their values as they were before the loop started, and the variables i and j will be reset to 0 for each new test case.**
