### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for handling large inputs.
   - The program uses an index to traverse the input list, which is a common approach for parsing input in this format.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The initial state of the program is correctly described. The function `func_1` is called, and it processes the input as expected.

2. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This allows for quick calculation of the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r]` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The prefix XOR array is correctly calculated. For each element `a[i]`, `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `mp` to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs.
   - This helps in quickly finding if there are indices within the range `[l, r]` that have the same prefix XOR value.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The dictionary `mp` is correctly populated with the indices of each prefix XOR value. This helps in quickly finding if there are multiple occurrences of the same prefix XOR value within a given range.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r]` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, it means the subarray can be divided into parts where each part's XOR is `0`, making it interesting.
   - If the XOR is not `0`, the program checks if there are indices within the range `[l, r]` that have the same prefix XOR value. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`).
   - **Annotation Verification:** The program correctly calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r]` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If the XOR is `0`, the subarray is interesting, and the program correctly appends "YES" to the results.
   - If the XOR is not `0`, the program uses binary search to find if there are indices within the range `[l, r]` that have the same prefix XOR value. This is a correct approach because if there are multiple occurrences of the same prefix XOR value within the range, it means the subarray can be divided into parts with the same XOR.

5. **Binary Search:**
   - The binary search is correctly used to find the first index in `mp[pf[r]]` that is greater than or equal to `l` and the last index in `mp[pf[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - The conditions `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` ensure that the indices are valid.
   - The condition `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` ensures that the indices are within the range and can be used to divide the subarray into parts with the same XOR.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The binary search and the conditions are correctly implemented to ensure that the indices are valid and within the range.

6. **Output:**
   - The results for all queries are collected in a list and printed at the end.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The final state of the program includes the printed results for all queries across all test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. It efficiently handles the input, constructs the necessary data structures, and processes the queries to determine if the subarrays are interesting. The annotations confirm that the program's logic and state transitions are accurate.

Final: **True**
