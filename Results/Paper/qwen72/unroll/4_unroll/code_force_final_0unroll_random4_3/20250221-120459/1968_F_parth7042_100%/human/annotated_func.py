#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, `a` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l` and `r` representing the query. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = defaultdict(list)
        
        mp[0].append(0)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `data` is a list of substrings from the input string, `index` is the index after all loop iterations, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: - Since the exact content of the `results` list is not provided, we can't determine the specific sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' values.
    #   - However, we know that the output will be a series of 'YES' and 'NO' values, each on a new line.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input data, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case involves an array `a` and a set of queries. For each query, the function determines if the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r` is zero or if there exists a subarray within the query range that has a zero XOR. The function prints 'YES' if the condition is met for a query, and 'NO' otherwise. The final state of the program includes the printed results for all queries across all test cases.
