You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, `a` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l` and `r` representing the query. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = defaultdict(list)
        
        mp[0].append(0)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `data` is a list of substrings from the input string, `index` is the index after all loop iterations, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: - Since the exact content of the `results` list is not provided, we can't determine the specific sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' values.
    #   - However, we know that the output will be a series of 'YES' and 'NO' values, each on a new line.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries`. The function returns a list of results, where each result is derived from the elements of the array `a` and the query range `l` to `r` for each query in `queries`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
