Precondition: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, `a` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l` and `r` representing the query. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
