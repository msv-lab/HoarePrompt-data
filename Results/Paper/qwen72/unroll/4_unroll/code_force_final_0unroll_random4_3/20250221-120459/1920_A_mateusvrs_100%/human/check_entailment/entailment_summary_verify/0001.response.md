### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.
   - It then reads `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)` for each test case, which is in line with the problem description.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cx` is a set used to store the values of `k` that must be not equal to some integer. This is appropriate because sets ensure uniqueness and efficient look-up.
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (1,000,000,007) to represent the upper bound of `k`. This is a reasonable choice to ensure that any initial upper bound constraint will be less than this value.
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to represent the lower bound of `k`. This is also a reasonable choice to ensure that any initial lower bound constraint will be greater than this value.

3. **Reading Constraints**:
   - The program correctly processes each constraint:
     - If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`, ensuring `k` is at least `x`.
     - If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`, ensuring `k` is at most `x`.
     - If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx`, ensuring `k` is not equal to `x`.

4. **Validation of Bounds**:
   - The program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds simultaneously, and it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - This check is correct and necessary to handle cases where the constraints are contradictory.

5. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - If the bounds are valid (`bx <= ax`), the program initializes a temporary variable `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates over the set `cx` and counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - The number of valid integers `k` is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
   - This calculation is correct because `ax - bx + 1` gives the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`, and `tmp` subtracts the invalid values that must be excluded.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, each on a new line.
   - This is in line with the problem description and the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints, updates the bounds, and counts the valid integers appropriately. The use of a set for the "not equal" constraints ensures efficiency and correctness.
