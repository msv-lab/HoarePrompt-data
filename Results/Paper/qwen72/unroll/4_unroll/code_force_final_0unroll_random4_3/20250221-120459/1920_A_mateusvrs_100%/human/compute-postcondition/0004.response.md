Based on the initial state provided:

- `r` is a list of integers.
- Each integer in `r` represents the number of valid values for `k` for each test case.
- The length of `r` is equal to `t`, the number of test cases.
- If no valid `k` exists for a test case, the corresponding element in `r` is 0.

The `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of the list `r` on a new line. Since the exact values of `r` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the information given.

Output: **Each element of the list `r` printed on a new line, where each element represents the number of valid values for `k` for each test case, and is 0 if no valid `k` exists for that test case.**
