Output State: **`r` is a list of integers, each representing the number of valid values for `k` for each test case, after processing all `t` test cases. The length of `r` is equal to `t`. Each element in `r` is calculated based on the constraints provided for each test case. If no valid `k` exists for a test case, the corresponding element in `r` is 0.**
