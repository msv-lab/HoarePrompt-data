Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, each with a set of constraints, and calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (1000000000 + 7) to represent the upper bound of `k`.
   - It initializes `bx` to -1 to represent the lower bound of `k`.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).

3. **Constraint Application**:
   - For each constraint, it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x` if the constraint is of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x).
   - It updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x` if the constraint is of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x).
   - It adds `x` to the set `cx` if the constraint is of type 3 (k must not be equal to x).

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds, so it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, and subtracts the number of integers in `cx` that fall within this range to get the final count of valid integers `k`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

The program handles all the constraints correctly and ensures that the solution is finite and valid as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
