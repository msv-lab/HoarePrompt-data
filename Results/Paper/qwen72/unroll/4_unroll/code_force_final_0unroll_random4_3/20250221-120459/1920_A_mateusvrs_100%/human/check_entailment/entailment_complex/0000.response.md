Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of constraints `n` and the constraints themselves.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cx` is a set used to store the values of `x` for which `k` must not be equal (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`), which is effectively the upper bound for `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to `-1`, which is effectively the lower bound for `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For type 1 constraints (`a == 1`), the program updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`, ensuring that `k` must be at least as large as the largest lower bound.
   - For type 2 constraints (`a == 2`), the program updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`, ensuring that `k` must be at most as large as the smallest upper bound.
   - For type 3 constraints (`a == 3`), the program adds `x` to the set `cx`, ensuring that `k` must not be equal to any of these values.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if the lower bound `bx` is greater than the upper bound `ax`. If this is the case, it appends `0` to the result list `r` because no integer `k` can satisfy this condition.
   - If the bounds are valid, the program calculates the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) and subtracts the number of values in `cx` that fall within this range. This is done by iterating over the set `cx` and counting the values that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints each element of the result list `r` on a new line, which is the correct format for the output.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. It also ensures that the constraints are processed in a way that respects the problem's guarantees and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
