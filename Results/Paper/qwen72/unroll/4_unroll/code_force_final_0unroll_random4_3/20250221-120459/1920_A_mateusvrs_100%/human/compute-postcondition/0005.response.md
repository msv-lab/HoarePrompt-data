The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is expected to accept a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, and each constraint is a pair of integers `(a, x)` where `a` is in {1, 2, 3} and `1 <= x <= 10^9`. The constraints are as follows:
- `a=1` means `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`.
- `a=2` means `k` must be less than or equal to `x`.
- `a=3` means `k` must not be equal to `x`.

The function is expected to determine a value of `k` that satisfies all the constraints for each test case. If such a value of `k` exists, the function returns it; otherwise, it returns a specific message indicating that no such `k` can be found.

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)` representing constraints. It returns a value of `k` that satisfies all the constraints for each test case. If no such `k` exists, it returns a specific message indicating the failure.**
