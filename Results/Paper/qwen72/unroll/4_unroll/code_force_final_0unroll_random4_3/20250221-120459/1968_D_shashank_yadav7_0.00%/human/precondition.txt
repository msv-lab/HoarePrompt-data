t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, P_B and P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, p is a permutation of length n with elements 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, a is an array of length n with elements 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
