The function `func` accepts multiple parameters for each test case: `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case:
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5.
- `k` is an integer representing the duration of the game, with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `P_B` and `P_S` are integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively, with the constraint 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n.
- `p` is a permutation of length `n`, where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n.
- `a` is an array of length `n`, where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The sum of values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

The function returns the result of the game for each test case, which is not explicitly defined in the provided output but can be inferred to be some form of outcome based on the game's rules and the parameters provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. It returns the result of the game for each test case, where `n` is the length of the permutation, `k` is the duration of the game, `P_B` and `P_S` are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, `p` is a permutation of length `n`, and `a` is an array of length `n`.**
