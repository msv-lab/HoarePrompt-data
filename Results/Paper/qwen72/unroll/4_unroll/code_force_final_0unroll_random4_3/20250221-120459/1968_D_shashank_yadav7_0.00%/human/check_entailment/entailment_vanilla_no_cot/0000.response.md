Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**: The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. The logic for updating `bm` and `sm` (the scores of Bodya and Sasha) is flawed. Specifically, the lines:
   ```python
   bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
   sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
   ```
   These lines are not necessary and do not follow the rules of the game. The correct way to update the scores is to simply add the value of `a[x]` to the current score, where `x` is the current position of the player.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop that updates the positions and scores is not correctly implemented. The loop should run for exactly `k` turns, but the program uses a decrementing `k` inside the loop, which can lead to incorrect behavior if `k` is large.

3. **Incorrect Position Updates**: The positions are updated using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, which is incorrect because the permutation `p` is 1-indexed. The correct way to update the positions is to use `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` only if the player decides to move, but the program does not handle the decision to stay or move correctly.

4. **Incorrect Final Score Comparison**: The final scores are compared using `bm` and `sm`, which are not correctly calculated due to the issues mentioned above.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1  # Convert to 0-indexed
        s -= 1  # Convert to 0-indexed

        # Initialize scores
        bodya_score = 0
        sasha_score = 0

        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k):
            # Update scores
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]

            # Move to the next position or stay
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1

        # Determine the winner
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version correctly simulates the game by updating the scores and positions for each turn and then comparing the final scores to determine the winner.
