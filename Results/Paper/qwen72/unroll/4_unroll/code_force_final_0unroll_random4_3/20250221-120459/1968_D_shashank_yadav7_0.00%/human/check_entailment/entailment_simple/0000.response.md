### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Positions**:
   - The program adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indices, which is necessary for Python's list indexing.

3. **Initial Scores**:
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, which is correct as they start at these positions and immediately gain the corresponding scores.

4. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `bm` and `sm` to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively, which is incorrect. The scores should be initialized to `a[b]` and `a[s]` and then updated over the `k` turns.
   - The loop iterates `k` times, but the loop variable `i` is not used correctly. The loop should iterate exactly `k` times, not `n` times.
   - Inside the loop, the program updates the positions `b` and `s` using the permutation `p`, which is correct.
   - However, the score updates are incorrect. The scores should be updated by adding `a[b]` and `a[s]` to `bp` and `sp` respectively, not by using the `max` function in the way it is currently used.

5. **Final Comparison**:
   - After the loop, the program compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner, but these variables are not correctly calculated.

### Correctness:
- The program has logical errors in the score calculation and the loop iteration.
- The use of `max` in the score updates is incorrect and does not follow the game rules.
- The loop should iterate `k` times, not `n` times.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
