### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices.

2. **Score Initialization:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to the values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.
   - The total scores `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively, which is incorrect. The total scores should start at 0 and be updated over the `k` turns.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program iterates `n` times, which is incorrect. It should iterate `k` times to simulate the game turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - The program uses `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to update the scores, which is incorrect. This logic does not follow the game rules. The correct approach should be to simply add the score from the current position to the total score and then move to the next position based on the permutation.

4. **Position Update:**
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated correctly based on the permutation `p`.

5. **Score Update:**
   - The scores `bp` and `sp` should be updated by adding the value at the current position in `a` to the total score.
   - The maximum score calculation is unnecessary and incorrect.

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The initial scores `bp` and `sp` are set to 0.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each turn, the score of Bodya and Sasha is increased by the value at their current position in `a`.
   - The positions are then updated based on the permutation `p`.

3. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After `k` turns, the final scores are compared, and the result is printed accordingly.

### Correctness:
- The original program contains logical errors in the score calculation and the number of iterations.
- The corrected program accurately follows the game rules and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
