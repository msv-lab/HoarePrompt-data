The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take the value of 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, 1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5, a is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'**
