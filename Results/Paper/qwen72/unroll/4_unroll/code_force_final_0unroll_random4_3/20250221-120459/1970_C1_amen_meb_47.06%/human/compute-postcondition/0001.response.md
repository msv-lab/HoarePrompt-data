For the given `while True:` loop, the loop condition is always `True`, meaning the loop will execute at least once regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the program state for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided externally, consisting of the number of nodes `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), the number of rounds `t` (t=1), and a list of edges defining the tree, followed by the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, and the starting node is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. The list `numbers` is an empty list.**
