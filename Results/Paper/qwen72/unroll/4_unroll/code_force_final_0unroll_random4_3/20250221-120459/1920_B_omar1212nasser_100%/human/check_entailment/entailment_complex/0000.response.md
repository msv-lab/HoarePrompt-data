### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It sorts the list `a` to facilitate the optimal removal and negation of elements.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice's goal is to maximize the sum of the array by removing at most `k` elements.
   - Bob's goal is to minimize the sum of the array by multiplying at most `x` elements by -1.
   - The optimal strategy for Alice is to remove the smallest elements (since they contribute the least to the sum).
   - The optimal strategy for Bob is to multiply the largest elements by -1 (since they contribute the most to the sum).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is designed to calculate the maximum possible sum after Alice's and Bob's actions.
   - It initializes `s` as the sum of all elements in the sorted list `elements`.
   - It then calculates the sum of the last `x` elements (which are the largest elements) and subtracts twice this sum from `s` to account for Bob's negation.
   - The function iterates over the possible number of removals from 1 to `k`, adjusting the sum `s` and the sum of the last `x` elements `s2` accordingly.
   - For each iteration, it appends the adjusted sum to the list `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `k` or `x` is 0 correctly.
   - The function also handles the case where `k` or `x` is equal to `n` correctly by considering the appropriate sums and adjustments.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly simulates the optimal actions of both Alice and Bob.
   - The sorting of the array ensures that Alice removes the smallest elements and Bob negates the largest elements.
   - The loop in `func_2` ensures that all possible combinations of removals and negations are considered, and the maximum sum is returned.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly designed to handle the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
