The function operates in an interactive environment to find and print the indices `i` and `j` (0 ≤ i, j < n) that maximize the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j`, where `p` is a permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to find these indices. After processing each input permutation, the function prints the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` that maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j`. The function handles multiple test cases, resetting its internal state for each new input.
