### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \(3n\) queries, where each query compares \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\) using bitwise OR.
   - The interactor is not adaptive, meaning the permutation \(p\) is fixed for each test case.

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding an index \( \text{mak} \) such that \( p_{\text{mak}} \) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - This is done by comparing \( (p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_{\text{mak}}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_i) \) for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \). If \( (p_i \mid p_i) \) is greater, \( \text{mak} \) is updated to \( i \).

3. **Finding the Second Maximum:**
   - Once \( \text{mak} \) is found, the program then tries to find another index \( \text{mak2} \) that maximizes \( p_{\text{mak}} \oplus p_{\text{mak2}} \).
   - This is done by comparing \( (p_{\text{mak}} \mid p_{\text{mak2}}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_{\text{mak2}}) \) for each \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \). If \( (p_i \mid p_{\text{mak2}}) \) is greater, \( \text{mak} \) is updated to \( i \).

4. **Refining the Second Maximum:**
   - After identifying potential candidates for \( \text{mak2} \) (stored in the list `pans`), the program further refines the choice by comparing \( (p_{\text{pans}[mak]} \mid p_{\text{pans}[mak]}) \) with \( (p_{\text{pans}[i]} \mid p_{\text{pans}[i]}) \) for each \( i \) in `pans`.
   - The index \( \text{mak} \) is updated to the one that gives the maximum value.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - Finally, the program outputs the indices \( \text{mak2} \) and \( \text{pans}[mak] \) as the answer.

6. **Query Count:**
   - The program makes \( n-1 \) queries to find the initial maximum.
   - It then makes \( n \) queries to find the second maximum.
   - Finally, it makes \( \text{len(pans)} - 1 \) queries to refine the second maximum.
   - The total number of queries is \( (n-1) + n + (\text{len(pans)} - 1) \leq 3n \), which satisfies the constraint.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it will directly output the two indices.
   - The program also handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating over the number of test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically sound and follows the constraints and requirements of the problem. It correctly uses the queries to find the maximum XOR pair and ensures that the number of queries does not exceed \(3n\).

Correctness: **True**
