### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation `p`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Element (`mak`):**
   - The variable `mak` is initialized to 0.
   - The function iterates over the range `[1, n)` and for each index `i`, it asks a query `? mak mak i i`.
   - The query compares `(p_mak | p_mak)` with `(p_i | p_i)`. Since `p_mak | p_mak` is just `p_mak` and `p_i | p_i` is just `p_i`, this effectively compares `p_mak` with `p_i`.
   - If the response is `<`, it means `p_i` is greater than `p_mak`, so `mak` is updated to `i`.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum Element (`mak2`):**
   - The variable `mak2` is initialized to the value of `mak`.
   - The function then iterates over all indices `i` and asks a query `? mak mak2 i mak2`.
   - This query compares `(p_mak | p_mak2)` with `(p_i | p_mak2)`.
   - If the response is `<`, it means `p_i` is a better candidate than `mak` for the maximum XOR, so `mak` is updated to `i` and `pans` is reset to `[i]`.
   - If the response is `=`, it means `p_i` is equal to `p_mak2` in terms of the OR operation, so `i` is added to `pans`.

4. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - The variable `mak` is reset to 0.
   - The function iterates over the indices stored in `pans` and asks a query `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]`.
   - This query compares `(p_pans[mak] | p_pans[mak])` with `(p_pans[i] | p_pans[i])`, which is effectively comparing `p_pans[mak]` with `p_pans[i]`.
   - If the response is `>`, it means `p_pans[i]` is greater than `p_pans[mak]`, so `mak` is updated to `i`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, the function prints the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` as the pair that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j`.
   - The output is flushed to ensure it is sent to the interactor.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly identifies the maximum element in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum.
- It then identifies the second maximum element by comparing the OR of the current maximum with each element and storing the indices that are equal to the current maximum.
- The final step is to find the maximum XOR pair among the indices stored in `pans`.

### Query Count:
- The first loop makes `n-1` queries.
- The second loop makes `n` queries.
- The third loop makes at most `n-1` queries.
- The total number of queries is `2n-2 + n-1 = 3n-3`, which is within the limit of `3n` queries.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem's requirements and constraints. It uses the allowed number of queries to find the indices `i` and `j` that maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

### Correctness:
**True**
