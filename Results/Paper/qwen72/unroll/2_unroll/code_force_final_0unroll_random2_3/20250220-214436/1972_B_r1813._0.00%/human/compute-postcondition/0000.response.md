Output State: **The function is set up to read input from `sys.stdin`, but no actual input or processing has occurred yet. The parameters `t` and the list of tuples remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the `read` method of `sys.stdin` to the variable `input`.
- This change only affects the `input` variable, which now refers to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.
- The parameters `t` and the list of tuples (each containing an integer `n` and a string `s`) are not modified by this code snippet.
- Therefore, the initial state of `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and the list of tuples (each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "U" and "D") remains unchanged.
