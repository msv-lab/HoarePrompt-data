Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by reading the number of coins and the string representing the coins' states from this list.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The game is won by the player who can make the last move.
   - The key observation is that the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) determines the winner. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can always make the first move, and the parity of the number of facing-up coins will ensure that she can always make the last move. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win because he will be the one to make the last move.

3. **Output**: The program appends the result for each test case to a list and then prints each result, which matches the required output format.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, it is correct.
