Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads `m` lines of friendship data, storing them in the `friendships` list.

2. **Friendship Value Calculation:**
   - `func_1` is called with the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.
   - Inside `func_1`, the function iterates over each friendship tuple `(a, b, f)` in the `friendships` list.
   - It calculates the contribution of each friendship to the expected value using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
   - The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` correctly computes the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions.
   - The result is accumulated and returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs is correctly calculated by summing the contributions of each friendship.
   - The contribution of each friendship is correctly adjusted for the number of excursions, as the friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation is applied correctly to ensure that the result fits within the required constraints and is consistent with the problem's requirements.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where there are no friendships (`m = 0`) correctly by returning 0, as no friendship values will be increased.
   - The function also handles the case where there is only one friendship correctly, as shown in the example test cases.

6. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic in both functions aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the expected output for each.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
