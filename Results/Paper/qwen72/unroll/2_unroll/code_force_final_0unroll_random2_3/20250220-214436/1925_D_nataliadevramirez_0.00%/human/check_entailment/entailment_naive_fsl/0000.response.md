Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the friendship values. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of the friendship values for all pairs, multiplied by the sum of the first k natural numbers, and then takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). However, this approach does not account for the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion, which is essential for calculating the expected value.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
Here, there are 3 children, 1 pair of friends (1 and 2) with an initial friendship value of 1, and 2 excursions.

**Expected Output:**
The expected value of the sum of friendship values of the chosen pairs over the 2 excursions should be calculated as follows:
- There are 3 children, so there are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) possible pairs: (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3).
- The pair (1, 2) has an initial friendship value of 1.
- The probability of choosing the pair (1, 2) in each excursion is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

For the first excursion:
- If (1, 2) is chosen, the friendship value becomes 2.
- If (1, 3) or (2, 3) is chosen, the friendship value remains 1.

For the second excursion:
- If (1, 2) is chosen again, the friendship value becomes 3.
- If (1, 3) or (2, 3) is chosen, the friendship value remains 2.

The expected value of the sum of friendship values over the 2 excursions is:
\[ E = \left( \frac{1}{3} \times (1 + 2) \right) + \left( \frac{2}{3} \times (1 + 1) \right) = \frac{1}{3} \times 3 + \frac{2}{3} \times 2 = 1 + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \]

However, the program calculates:
\[ \text{result} = 1 \times \left( \frac{2 \times (2 + 1)}{2} \right) = 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

This is incorrect, as the expected value should be \( \frac{7}{3} \), which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 233333336.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation and fails for this case.
