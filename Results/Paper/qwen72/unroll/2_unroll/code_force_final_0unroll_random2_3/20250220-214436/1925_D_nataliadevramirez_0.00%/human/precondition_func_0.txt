n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of friend pairs, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing the indices of the children who are friends and their initial friendship value. The values satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b, and 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9.
