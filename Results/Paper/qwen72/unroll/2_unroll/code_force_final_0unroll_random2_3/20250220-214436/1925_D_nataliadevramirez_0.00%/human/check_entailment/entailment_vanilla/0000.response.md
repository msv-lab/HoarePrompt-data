Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have `n` children, `m` pairs of friends, and `k` excursions.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
   - For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime, and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of `friendships` as input.
     - It initializes `result` to 0.
     - It iterates over each friendship pair, and for each pair, it adds the product of the initial friendship value `f` and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers \(\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\) to `result`.
     - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - Finally, it returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
     - It reads the `m` friendship pairs and stores them in a list `friendships`.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the result.

3. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - **Function 1**:
     - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is correctly calculated as \(\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\).
     - The expected value calculation is incorrect. The program assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen in every excursion, which is not true. The correct expected value for each friendship pair should be the initial value `f` plus the expected number of times the pair is chosen over `k` excursions.
     - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\), where \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) is the total number of possible pairs of children.
     - Therefore, the correct expected value for each friendship pair should be \(f + \frac{k \cdot f}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

   - **Function 2**:
     - The input reading and test case handling are correct.
     - The call to `func_1` is correct.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. It assumes each pair is chosen in every excursion, which is not the case. The correct calculation involves the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion.

Correctness: **False**
