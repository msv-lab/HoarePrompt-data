### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The key insight is to understand how the destruction of bridges affects the connectivity of the islands.

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - There are \( n \) islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. This means the graph is a complete graph with \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) bridges.
   - Everule starts on island 1 and can visit any other island using these bridges.

2. **Optimal Bridge Destruction**:
   - Dominater can destroy up to \( k \) bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.
   - If \( k \) is large enough to disconnect all bridges from island 1, then Everule will only be able to visit island 1.
   - If \( k \) is not large enough to disconnect all bridges from island 1, then Everule can still visit all islands.

3. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - The number of bridges connected to island 1 is \( n-1 \).
   - If \( k \geq n-1 \), then Dominater can disconnect all bridges from island 1, and Everule will only be able to visit island 1.
   - If \( k < n-1 \), then Dominater cannot disconnect all bridges from island 1, and Everule can still visit all \( n \) islands.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then checks if \( n - k \leq 1 \). If true, it prints \( n \) (indicating Everule can visit all islands). If false, it prints 1 (indicating Everule can only visit island 1).

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The condition \( n - k \leq 1 \) is equivalent to \( k \geq n - 1 \). This correctly identifies whether Dominater can disconnect all bridges from island 1.
   - If \( k \geq n - 1 \), the program prints 1, which is correct.
   - If \( k < n - 1 \), the program prints \( n \), which is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit based on the optimal destruction of bridges by Dominater. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
