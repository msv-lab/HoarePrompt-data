The function reads an integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, where `n` is the number of islands and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed. It then prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it prints 1. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the input values for `n` and `k` are not retained, and the program state is unchanged except for the printed output.
