The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case in `t` is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a`. The constraints are: `1 <= t <= 1000`, `1 <= n <= 50`, `1 <= m <= 5`, and `a` is a string of `n` characters where each character is from 'A' to 'G'. After executing the function body, the function always returns 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `t` of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a`. It always returns 0.**
