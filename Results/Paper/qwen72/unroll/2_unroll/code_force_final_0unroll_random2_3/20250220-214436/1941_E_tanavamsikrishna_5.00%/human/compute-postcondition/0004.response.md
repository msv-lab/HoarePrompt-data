To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
```

The variables and objects in the loop head are:
- `i`
- `costs`
- `k`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is the loop variable that will be iterated over the range. It starts at 0 by default and increments by 1 for each iteration.

2. **Variable `costs`**:
   - `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`.
   - For the loop to execute, `costs` must have at least one element. If `costs` is empty, the loop will not run.

3. **Variable `k`**:
   - `k` is a variable that is used to determine the range of the loop. Specifically, the loop will run from `0` to `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0. This means `len(costs) >= k`.

### Adjustments Needed:

- **`i`**: This variable is automatically initialized to 0 by the `for` loop, so no adjustment is needed.
- **`costs`**: The list `costs` must have at least `k` elements for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`k`**: `k` must be a positive integer and less than or equal to the length of `costs`.

### Final State:

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are unchanged.
- `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers.
- `costs` is a list of length `n`.
- `total_costs` is an empty list.

We need to ensure that `costs` has at least `k` elements and `k` is a positive integer. Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are unchanged; `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers; `costs` is a list of length `n` and must have at least `k` elements; `total_costs` is an empty list; `i` is 0**
