You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/6b5282a065196a0a0ca650a68a351af816de8549.png)
It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in `func_1` that does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the problem description. Specifically, the function does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Support Placement on the First `d-1` Cells:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, d - 1):
       row[i] = row[i] + 1
   ```
   This loop increments the cost of the first `d-1` cells by 1, which is incorrect. According to the problem, supports must be placed in the first and last columns, and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. This loop does not ensure that supports are placed at the correct intervals.

2. **Support Placement on the Remaining Cells:**
   ```python
   for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
       row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
   ```
   This loop attempts to place supports by finding the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells, but it does not correctly handle the placement of supports. The logic here is flawed because it does not ensure that supports are placed at the correct intervals and does not consider the constraints of the problem.

3. **Example Case:**
   Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1
   3 11 1 4
   0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
   0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
   0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
   ```
   The correct output should be `4` (as mentioned in the problem description), but the provided program will not produce this output. The program incorrectly calculates the cost of placing supports and does not ensure that the distance between supports is no more than `d`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
