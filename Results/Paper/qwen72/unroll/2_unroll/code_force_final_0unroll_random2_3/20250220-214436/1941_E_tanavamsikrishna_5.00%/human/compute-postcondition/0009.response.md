Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input, including four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and a grid of `n` rows and `m` columns representing river depths. It computes the minimum cost of a sequence of `k` consecutive rows, where the cost of each row is determined by a helper function `func_1`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged, the grid `rows` is unchanged, the list `costs` contains the computed costs for each row, and the list `total_costs` contains the sums of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list. The function prints the minimum value from `total_costs`. **
