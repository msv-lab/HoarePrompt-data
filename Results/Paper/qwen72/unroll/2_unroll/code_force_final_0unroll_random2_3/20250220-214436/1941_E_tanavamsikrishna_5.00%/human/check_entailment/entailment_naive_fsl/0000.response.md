Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in `func_1` that does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the problem description. Specifically, the function does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Support Placement on the First `d-1` Cells:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, d - 1):
       row[i] = row[i] + 1
   ```
   This loop increments the cost of the first `d-1` cells by 1, which is incorrect. According to the problem, supports must be placed in the first and last columns, and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. This loop does not ensure that supports are placed at the correct intervals.

2. **Support Placement on the Remaining Cells:**
   ```python
   for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
       row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
   ```
   This loop attempts to place supports by finding the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells, but it does not correctly handle the placement of supports. The logic here is flawed because it does not ensure that supports are placed at the correct intervals and does not consider the constraints of the problem.

3. **Example Case:**
   Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1
   3 11 1 4
   0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
   0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
   0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
   ```
   The correct output should be `4` (as mentioned in the problem description), but the provided program will not produce this output. The program incorrectly calculates the cost of placing supports and does not ensure that the distance between supports is no more than `d`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
