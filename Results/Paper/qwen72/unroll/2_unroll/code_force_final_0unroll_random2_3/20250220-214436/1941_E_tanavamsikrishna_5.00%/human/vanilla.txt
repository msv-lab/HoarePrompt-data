- The algorithm used in `func_1` is a dynamic programming approach that ensures the minimum cost for installing supports while respecting the distance constraint `d`.
   - The algorithm in `func_2` correctly iterates over all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, respects the constraints, and uses an appropriate dynamic programming approach to minimize the total cost of installing supports.
