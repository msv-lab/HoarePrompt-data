Output State: **The function `func` processes `t` test cases, and for each test case, it prints a list of integers representing the bets on each outcome, or -1 if no such distribution exists. The variables `T`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `ans` are updated and used within the loop, but their final values after the loop will depend on the last test case processed.**

To break it down:
- `T` will be equal to `t - 1` after the loop finishes (since the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`).
- `bets` will be the number of outcomes for the last test case.
- `a` will be a list of the bets for the last test case.
- `prod` will be the product of the multipliers for the last test case.
- `sumo` will be the sum of the bets for the last test case.
- `ans` will be a string containing the bets for the last test case, formatted as space-separated integers.

The other variables in the initial state (like `t`) remain unchanged.
