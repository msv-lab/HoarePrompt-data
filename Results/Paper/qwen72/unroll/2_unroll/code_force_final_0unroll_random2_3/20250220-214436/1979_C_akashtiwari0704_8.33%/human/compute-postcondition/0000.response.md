Output State: **The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. The function should return a list of n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) representing the bets on each outcome, such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. If no such distribution exists, the function should return -1. `t` is an input integer.**
