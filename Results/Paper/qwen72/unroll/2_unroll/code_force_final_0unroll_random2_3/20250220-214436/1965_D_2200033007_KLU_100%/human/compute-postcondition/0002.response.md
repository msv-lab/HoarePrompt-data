Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of the odd-indexed subarrays of the hidden palindrome array, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `prev` is 0, `idx` is (n - 1) // 2.**

The variable `idx` is assigned the value of `(n - 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n - 1` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
