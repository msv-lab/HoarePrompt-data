To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of `smallList` and `bigList` as they are the only objects in the loop head.

The loop condition is:
```
while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
```

This means:
1. `smallList` must have at least one element (`len(smallList) > 0`).
2. The last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList` (`bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`).

Given the initial state:
- `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers.
- `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once:
- `smallList` must have at least one element.
- The last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`.

Since `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`, it is possible that `smallList` could be empty if it is a subsequence of the empty part of `bigList`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `smallList` has at least one element. Additionally, we need to ensure that the last elements of both lists are equal.

State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, `smallList` is a subsequence of `bigList`, `smallList` must have at least one element, and the last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`**
