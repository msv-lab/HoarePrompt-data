The function `func_2` accepts a list `cts` of integers and returns a list `odds` containing the unique elements from `cts` that do not have a duplicate immediately preceding them. If `cts` contains pairs of identical elements, only the first element of each pair is included in `odds`. If there are no such pairs, `odds` will contain all elements from `cts`.
