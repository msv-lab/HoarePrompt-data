The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `k`, where `a` is a list of integers of length 2n, containing each integer from 1 to n exactly twice, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, the function needs to find two subsets `l` and `r` of length 2k from the first half and the second half of `a`, respectively, such that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.
