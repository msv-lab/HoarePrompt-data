Reasoning:  
The program provided is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, with a daily purchase limit of `m` tickets. The approach taken by the program is to sort the ticket prices in ascending order and then purchase tickets starting from the cheapest day, while respecting the daily limit and the incremental price increase due to previous purchases.

Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly addresses the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It reads the list of ticket prices `l` for each day.

2. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `l` in ascending order. This ensures that the cheapest tickets are considered first, which is a good strategy for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Cost:**
   - The program initializes `t` to 0, which keeps track of the total number of tickets purchased so far.
   - It initializes `s` and `c` to 0, where `s` is the number of tickets to purchase on the current day and `c` is the cumulative cost.
   - For each day, it calculates `s` as the minimum of `m` (the daily limit) and `k` (the remaining tickets to buy).
   - It adds the cost of purchasing `s` tickets on the current day to `c`, taking into account the price increase due to previous purchases (`t`).
   - It updates `t` by adding `s` to it, and decreases `k` by `s`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total cost `c` for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - Sorting the prices ensures that the program always buys the cheapest available tickets first, which is a valid strategy for minimizing the total cost.
  - The program correctly handles the daily limit `m` and the incremental price increase by adding `t` to the price of each ticket purchased on a given day.
  - The program ensures that exactly `k` tickets are purchased by decrementing `k` each time tickets are bought and stopping when `k` reaches 0.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by purchasing all remaining tickets in a single day.
  - It also handles the case where `k` is greater than `m` by purchasing the maximum allowed tickets each day until `k` is satisfied.

- **Performance:**
  - The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.
  - The subsequent loop has a time complexity of \(O(n)\), making the overall complexity \(O(n \log n)\), which is acceptable for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets, considering the daily limit and the price increase due to previous purchases. It handles all the requirements and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
