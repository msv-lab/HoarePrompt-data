### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `l` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the cheapest tickets are purchased first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes variables `t`, `s`, and `c` to 0. 
     - `t` keeps track of the total number of tickets purchased so far.
     - `s` determines the number of tickets to purchase on the current day.
     - `c` accumulates the total cost of the tickets.

4. **Ticket Purchase Loop:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted list of ticket prices.
   - For each day, it determines the number of tickets to purchase (`s`) as the minimum of `m` (the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day) and `k` (the remaining number of tickets needed).
   - It then calculates the cost of purchasing `s` tickets on the current day, taking into account the increase in price due to previous purchases (`t`).
   - The total cost `c` is updated by adding the cost of the current day's purchases.
   - The total number of tickets purchased `t` is updated by adding the number of tickets purchased on the current day.
   - The remaining number of tickets needed `k` is decreased by the number of tickets purchased on the current day.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the total cost `c` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The program's approach is to always buy the cheapest available tickets first, which is a greedy strategy. This is correct because buying cheaper tickets first will minimize the total cost.
  - The program correctly handles the price increase for subsequent days by adding the number of tickets purchased so far to the price of the current day's tickets.
  - The program ensures that it does not exceed the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`).
  - The program also ensures that it does not purchase more tickets than needed (`k`).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by purchasing all remaining tickets on the first day.
  - The program handles the case where `k` is greater than `m` by purchasing `m` tickets on each day until `k` tickets are purchased.

- **Performance:**
  - The program sorts the list of ticket prices, which has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
  - The loop that purchases tickets runs in \(O(n)\) time.
  - The overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.
