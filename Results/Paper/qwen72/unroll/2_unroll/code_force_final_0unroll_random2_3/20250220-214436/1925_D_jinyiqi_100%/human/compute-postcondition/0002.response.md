The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts. The other parameters and constraints do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
