Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the friendship values. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the expected value is incorrect. The program calculates:

\[ p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \]
\[ q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2 \]

However, the correct formula should be:

\[ \text{Expected Value} = \frac{k \cdot \sum f + \binom{k}{2} \cdot m}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

Where:
- \(\sum f\) is the sum of the initial friendship values.
- \(\binom{k}{2}\) is the number of ways to choose 2 excursions out of \(k\), which is \(\frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2}\).
- \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of \(n\), which is \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).

The program's formula does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values due to the excursions. For example, consider the case where \(n = 3\), \(m = 1\), and \(k = 2\), with the initial friendship value of the only pair being 1. The correct expected value should be:

\[ \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot 1 + \binom{2}{2} \cdot 1}{\binom{3}{2}} = \frac{2 + 1}{3} = 1 \]

But the program calculates:

\[ p = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 12 + 2 = 14 \]
\[ q = 2 \cdot 3^2 = 18 \]

\[ \text{Expected Value} = \frac{14}{18} = \frac{7}{9} \]

This is incorrect, and the program does not handle this case correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
