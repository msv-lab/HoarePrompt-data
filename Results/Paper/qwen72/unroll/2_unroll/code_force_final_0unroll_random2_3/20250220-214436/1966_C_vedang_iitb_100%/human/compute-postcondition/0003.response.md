The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile, respectively. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the result is determined based on the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile. The specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints, but it is implied that the function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile.**
