Output State: **The loop will execute a number of times equal to the integer provided by the user. For each iteration, the user will input a string `s`. If the string `s` has a length of 1 or all characters in the string are the same (and the length is greater than 1), the loop will print 'No'. Otherwise, it will print 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of the string `s` (or a modified version if the shuffled string happens to be the same as the original). The variable `s` will be updated with each new input string in each iteration, but will not retain any value after the loop completes.**
