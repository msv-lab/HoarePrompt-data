Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Single Character String**: If the string `s` has only one character, it correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single-character string to form a different string.
3. **All Characters the Same**: If the string `s` has more than one character but all characters are the same, it correctly prints "No" because any rearrangement will still result in the same string.
4. **Rearrangement**: For other cases, it attempts to rearrange the string using `random.sample`, which shuffles the characters. If the shuffled string `s2` happens to be the same as the original string `s`, it manually swaps the first and last characters to ensure `s2` is different from `s`.
5. **Output**: It prints "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

The program handles all edge cases and ensures that the output is correct for the given problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
