You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` with elements greater than 0, and `q` queries. The input is provided in a specific format: the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `q` (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), followed by `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and then `q` lines each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the subarray for the i-th query. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    #State: The loop has processed all test cases. For each query, it has determined whether the sum of the subarray from `l_i` to `r_i` is at least twice the length of the subarray, and printed 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `l` are no longer in scope, and the final state of the program is that all input has been processed and the corresponding outputs have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it determines whether the sum of the subarray from `l_i` to `r_i` is at least twice the length of the subarray. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the results for all queries and the input has been fully processed. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of length `n`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sum array `p` where `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `l`.
   - This is done using a loop where `c` accumulates the sum of elements and `p` stores these cumulative sums.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `a` and `b` which define the subarray `c[a-1:b]`.
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sum array `p`. Specifically, `s = p[b-1] - p[a-2]` if `a > 1`, otherwise `s = p[b-1]`.

4. **Good Subarray Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying two conditions:
     - The length of the subarray `b - a + 1` must be greater than 1.
     - The sum of the subarray `s` must be at least twice the length of the subarray `2 * (b - a + 1)`.
   - If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** `b - a + 1 > 1`
  - This ensures that the subarray has at least two elements. If the subarray has only one element, it cannot be good because there is no way to construct a different array `b` of the same length where `b_i > 0` and `b_i != c_i`.

- **Condition 2:** `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`
  - This ensures that the sum of the subarray is at least twice the number of elements in the subarray. This is necessary because for each element `c_i` in the subarray, we need to find a corresponding `b_i` such that `b_i > 0` and `b_i != c_i`. The minimum sum of `b` would be `1 + 1 + ... + 1` (i.e., `b - a + 1`), and to ensure `b_i != c_i`, the sum of `b` must be at least `2 + 2 + ... + 2` (i.e., `2 * (b - a + 1)`).

### Potential Issues:
- **Indexing:**
  - The program uses `p[a-2]` to subtract the prefix sum before the subarray starts. This is correct because `p[a-2]` gives the sum of the first `a-1` elements, and `p[b-1]` gives the sum of the first `b` elements. The difference `p[b-1] - p[a-2]` gives the sum of the subarray `c[a-1:b]`.
  - However, when `a == 1`, `a-2` would be `-1`, which is out of bounds. The program correctly handles this by checking `if a - 2 >= 0`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element by checking `b - a + 1 > 1`.
  - It also correctly handles the case where the sum of the subarray is not sufficient to satisfy the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and input constraints appropriately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
