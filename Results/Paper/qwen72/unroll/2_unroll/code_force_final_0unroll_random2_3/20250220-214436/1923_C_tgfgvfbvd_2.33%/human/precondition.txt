c is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ len(c) ≤ 3 · 10^5, and queries is a list of tuples where each tuple (l_i, r_i) satisfies 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ len(c). The length of queries is q, where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5. The sum of the lengths of all c across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of all q across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
