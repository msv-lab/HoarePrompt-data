The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts input in a specific format: the first input is the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `q` (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), followed by an array `c` of length `n` containing integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and then `q` queries, each consisting of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The function processes each query to determine some property of the subarray `c[l_i...r_i]` and returns the results for all queries across all test cases. The sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an array `c` of integers and `q` queries. For each query, it returns a result based on the subarray `c[l_i...r_i]`.**
