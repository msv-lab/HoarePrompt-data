You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` with elements greater than 0, and `q` queries. The input is provided in a specific format: the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `q` (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), followed by `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and then `q` lines each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the subarray for the i-th query. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has processed all test cases. For each query, it has determined whether the sum of the subarray from `l_i` to `r_i` is at least twice the length of the subarray, and printed 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `l` are no longer in scope, and the final state of the program is that all input has been processed and the corresponding outputs have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an array `c` of integers and `q` queries. For each query, it returns a result based on the subarray `c[l_i...r_i]`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
