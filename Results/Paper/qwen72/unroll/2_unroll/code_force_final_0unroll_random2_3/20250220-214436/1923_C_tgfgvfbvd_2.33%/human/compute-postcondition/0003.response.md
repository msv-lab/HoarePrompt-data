Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it determines whether the sum of the subarray from `l_i` to `r_i` is at least twice the length of the subarray. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the results for all queries and the input has been fully processed. The function does not return any value. **
