### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of length `n`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the prefix sum array `p` for the array `l`. This is done by iterating through `l` and accumulating the sum `c` at each step, appending it to `p`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `a` and `b` which define the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]`.
   - It calculates the sum `s` of the subarray from `a` to `b` using the prefix sum array `p`.
   - The function checks if the subarray length `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and if the sum `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray. This is based on the condition that for the subarray to be good, the sum of the subarray must be at least twice the number of elements in the subarray, allowing for the construction of a valid array `b` where each element is different from the corresponding element in `c` and all elements in `b` are positive.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints 'YES' if the subarray is good and 'NO' otherwise.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the subarray length is 1. In this case, it always prints 'NO' because a subarray of length 1 cannot satisfy the condition that `a_i \neq b_i` for every index `i`.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of a prefix sum array `p` allows for efficient sum calculation for each subarray query in O(1) time, making the overall solution efficient for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The prefix sum array is used effectively to handle subarray sum queries, and the output is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
