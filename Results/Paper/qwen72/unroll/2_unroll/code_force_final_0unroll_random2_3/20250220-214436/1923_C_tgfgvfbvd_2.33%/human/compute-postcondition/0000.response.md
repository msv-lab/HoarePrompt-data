The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used in the context of the `range` function. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
