Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case is a distinct string of length 5 consisting of the letters 'A' and 'B'. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer between 1 and 32. For each test case, the function counts the number of 'A's and 'B's in the string. If the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function has printed a result ('A' or 'B') for each one, and the variables `l` and `h` are reset to 0 for each test case. **
