Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings containing the input data for `t` test cases, `input` is now a function that reads from `sys.stdin`, `data` is updated to a list of strings split from the input read by `input()`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value of the first element in the list `data`. The other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
