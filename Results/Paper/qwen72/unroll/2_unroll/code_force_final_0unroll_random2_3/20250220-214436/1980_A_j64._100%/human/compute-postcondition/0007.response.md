The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns the total number of additional problems needed to make the frequency of each character ('A' to 'G') in the string `a` at least `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`. It returns the total number of additional problems required to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`.**
