The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state of the function `func` and the parameters `a` and `n` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
