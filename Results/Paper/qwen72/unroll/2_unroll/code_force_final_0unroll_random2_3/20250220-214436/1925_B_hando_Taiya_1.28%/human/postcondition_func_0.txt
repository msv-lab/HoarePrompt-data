The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` from the user input, where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`. It then calculates and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest quotient of `x` divided by a divisor that is less than or equal to `n`. The function does not return any value. The state of `t` is not affected by this function, and `x` and `n` remain unchanged after the function concludes.
