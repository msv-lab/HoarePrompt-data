### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program reads `x` and `n` and initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It then iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x` using `isqrt(x)`.
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, it means `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - The program checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints `ans`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest quotient of `x` divided by a divisor that is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The goal is to find the maximum balance, which is the GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems.
   - The GCD of `n` sub-problems whose sum is `x` can be at most `x // n` because the sum of `n` sub-problems each with difficulty `x // n` is `x`.
   - The program correctly finds the largest divisor `i` of `x` such that `n` sub-problems can each have a difficulty of `i` or `x // i`, which ensures the GCD is maximized.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is equal to `x` (e.g., `5 5`), where the only possible sub-problems are `1` each, giving a GCD of `1`.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is less than `x` and finds the largest possible divisor or quotient that fits the criteria.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach to finding the maximum balance of the problemset. It correctly identifies the largest divisor or quotient that can be used to split `x` into `n` sub-problems, ensuring the GCD is maximized.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
