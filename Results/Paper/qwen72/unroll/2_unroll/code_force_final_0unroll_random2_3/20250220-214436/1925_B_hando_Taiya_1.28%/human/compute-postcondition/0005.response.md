The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, we can infer that the function likely accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.

The output of the function is not provided, so we cannot determine what it returns. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, we can assume that the function returns some value or result based on the input parameters `t`, `x`, and `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided.**
