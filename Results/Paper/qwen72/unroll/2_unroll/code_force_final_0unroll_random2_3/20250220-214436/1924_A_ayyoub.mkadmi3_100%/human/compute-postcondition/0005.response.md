The value of `r` is assigned the result of the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`. The length of `s1` is the number of unique characters from `s` that are in the initial alphabet set, and `k` is the number of the first lowercase English alphabets in the initial alphabet set. The values of `s1`, `s2`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string containing all characters from `s` that are in the initial alphabet set, with each character appearing only once. `s2` is a string containing the last character of `s` that was in the initial alphabet set, repeated `n` times. The alphabet set is reset to its initial state containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.**
