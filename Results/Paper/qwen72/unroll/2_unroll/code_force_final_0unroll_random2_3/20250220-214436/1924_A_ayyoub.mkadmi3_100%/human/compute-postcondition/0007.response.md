The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `s`, `k`, and `n`. `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 26. The function returns a tuple containing:
1. A boolean value indicating whether the length of a derived string `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`.
2. A substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, where `r` is some integer.
3. A string `s2` which contains the last character of `s` that was in the initial alphabet set, repeated `n` times.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and two integers `k` and `n`. It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the length of a derived string `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from a specific index to the end, and a string `s2` consisting of the last character from `s` that is in the initial alphabet set, repeated `n` times.**
