Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and two integers `k` and `n`. It processes `s` to create a string `s1` that contains each of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets from `s` at most once, and a string `s2` that consists of the last character from `s` that was in the initial alphabet set, repeated `n` times. The function returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end (where `r` is the quotient of the length of `s1` divided by `k`), and the string `s2`. **
