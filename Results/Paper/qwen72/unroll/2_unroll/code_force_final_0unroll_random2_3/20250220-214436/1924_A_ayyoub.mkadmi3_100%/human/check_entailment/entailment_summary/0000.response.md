Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`. If not, it should provide an example of such a string that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` (the length of the string `s`).
   - It then reads the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - If the character is in the `alphabet` set, it adds the character to `s1`.
     - If the `alphabet` set contains more than one character, it removes the character from the set.
     - If the `alphabet` set contains only one character, it adds the character to `s2` and resets the `alphabet` set.
   - It calculates `r` as the quotient of the length of `s1` divided by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - If the boolean returned by `func_1` is `False`, the program appends "No" to the `OUT` list.
   - It then constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s` by repeating the first character not in `s1` (if any) or the last character in `s2` (if all characters are in `s1`).
   - If the boolean is `True`, the program appends "Yes" to the `OUT` list.
   - Finally, it prints each element in the `OUT` list.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Subsequence Check:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The logic in `func_1` only checks if each character from the first `k` alphabets appears at least once in `s` and constructs `s1` and `s2` based on this.
   - It does not account for the combinations of characters that form strings of length `n`.

2. **Incorrect Substring Construction:**
   - The substring `s1[r * k:]` and the string `s2` are not used correctly to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.
   - The program constructs a string of length `n` by repeating a character not in `s1`, which is not a valid approach to find a missing subsequence.

3. **Missing Subsequence Example:**
   - The program does not generate a valid example of a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` when the answer is "No".
   - The logic for generating such a string is flawed and does not ensure that the generated string is indeed a missing subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s` and does not generate a valid example of a missing subsequence.

Correctness: **False**
