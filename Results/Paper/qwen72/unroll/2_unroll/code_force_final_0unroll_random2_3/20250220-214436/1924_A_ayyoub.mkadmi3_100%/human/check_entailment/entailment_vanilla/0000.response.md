### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - It initializes two empty strings `s1` and `s2` and a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is in `alphabet`, it removes `i` from `alphabet`.
     - If `alphabet` is not empty, it adds `i` to `s1`.
     - If `alphabet` becomes empty (all characters in the set have been used), it adds `i` to `s2` and resets `alphabet`.
   - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and gets the result `(b, s1, s2)`.
   - If `b` is `False` (i.e., not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`), it appends "No" to the output list `OUT`.
   - It then finds the first character not in `s1` and constructs a string of length `n` using this character to append to `s2`.
   - If `b` is `True`, it appends "Yes" to `OUT`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints each element in the `OUT` list.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` is intended to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
- However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed:
  - The set `alphabet` is reset to the full set of the first `k` alphabets whenever it becomes empty, which means it does not correctly track the subsequences.
  - The variable `s1` is used to build a string of characters that are in the set `alphabet`, but it does not ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are checked.
  - The variable `s2` is used to build a string of characters after `alphabet` becomes empty, but it does not help in determining if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
- The logic in `func_1` is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
