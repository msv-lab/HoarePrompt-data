You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length of 1 to 20 characters.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop does not modify the `digits` or `letters` lists. The loop checks conditions but does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, `digits` remains a sorted list containing all the digits from the string `password`, and `letters` remains a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True.
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`testCases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password (`length`) and the password itself (`password`).

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if the password meets the specified conditions.
   - It separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It sorts both lists to ensure that digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - It then checks if the sorted digits are in non-decreasing order. This is done by iterating through the `digits` list and comparing each digit with the next one. If any digit is greater than the next one, it returns `False`.
   - It also checks if any digit in the `digits` list is greater than any letter in the `letters` list. This is done by comparing the last digit (if any) with each letter in the `letters` list. If any digit is greater than a letter, it returns `False`.
   - Finally, it concatenates the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists to form a `sortedPassword` and compares it with the original `password`. If they are the same, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Conditions Verification:**
   - **Condition 1:** The program ensures that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits by using the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` methods implicitly when separating characters into `digits` and `letters`.
   - **Condition 2:** The program checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by comparing the last digit with each letter. If any digit is greater than a letter, it returns `False`.
   - **Condition 3:** The program sorts the `digits` list and checks if it is in non-decreasing order.
   - **Condition 4:** The program sorts the `letters` list and checks if it is in non-decreasing order.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where the password consists only of digits or only of letters correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem description specifies that the length is at least 1).

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `12ac`, the program correctly identifies that it is a valid password.
   - For the input `123wa`, the program correctly identifies that it is invalid because the letters are not sorted.
   - For the input `allllmost`, the program correctly identifies that it is a valid password.
   - For the input `ac123`, the program correctly identifies that it is invalid because a digit comes after a letter.
   - For the input `011679`, the program correctly identifies that it is a valid password.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions. It handles all edge cases and examples provided in the problem description.
