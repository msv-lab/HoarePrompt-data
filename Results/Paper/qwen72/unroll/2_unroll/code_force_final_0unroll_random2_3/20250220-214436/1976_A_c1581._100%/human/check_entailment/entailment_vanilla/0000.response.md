### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`testCases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password (`length`) and the password itself (`password`).

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if the password meets the specified conditions.
   - It separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It sorts both lists to ensure that digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - It then checks if the sorted digits are in non-decreasing order. This is done by iterating through the `digits` list and comparing each digit with the next one. If any digit is greater than the next one, it returns `False`.
   - It also checks if any digit in the `digits` list is greater than any letter in the `letters` list. This is done by comparing the last digit (if any) with each letter in the `letters` list. If any digit is greater than a letter, it returns `False`.
   - Finally, it concatenates the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists to form a `sortedPassword` and compares it with the original `password`. If they are the same, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Conditions Verification:**
   - **Condition 1:** The program ensures that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits by using the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` methods implicitly when separating characters into `digits` and `letters`.
   - **Condition 2:** The program checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by comparing the last digit with each letter. If any digit is greater than a letter, it returns `False`.
   - **Condition 3:** The program sorts the `digits` list and checks if it is in non-decreasing order.
   - **Condition 4:** The program sorts the `letters` list and checks if it is in non-decreasing order.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where the password consists only of digits or only of letters correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem description specifies that the length is at least 1).

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `12ac`, the program correctly identifies that it is a valid password.
   - For the input `123wa`, the program correctly identifies that it is invalid because the letters are not sorted.
   - For the input `allllmost`, the program correctly identifies that it is a valid password.
   - For the input `ac123`, the program correctly identifies that it is invalid because a digit comes after a letter.
   - For the input `011679`, the program correctly identifies that it is a valid password.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions. It handles all edge cases and examples provided in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
