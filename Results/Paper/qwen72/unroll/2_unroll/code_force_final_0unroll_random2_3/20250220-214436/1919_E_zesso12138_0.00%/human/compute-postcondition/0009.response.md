The only objects in the loop head are `res` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If `results` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `res` will be the first element of `results` at the start of the loop.

State: **`results` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `res` is the first element of `results`**
