Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Initialization**:
   - The `dp` array is correctly initialized to have a size of `2 * n + 1` to account for all possible prefix sums ranging from `-n` to `n`.
   - The `offset` is set to `n` to shift the indices of the `dp` array so that the prefix sum of 0 is at index `n`.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - The program iterates through each element of the array `a` (from 1 to `n`).
   - For each prefix sum `j`, it updates the `new_dp` array to include the counts of possible prefix sums that can be achieved by adding 1 or -1 to the current prefix sum.
   - The `new_dp` array is then used to update the `dp` array for the next iteration.
   - This transition logic is correct and ensures that all possible prefix sums are considered.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the final prefix sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.
   - The result is the value in the `dp` array at the index corresponding to the final prefix sum.
   - This calculation is correct and aligns with the problem's requirement to find the number of initial arrays `a` that result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end.
   - The input handling is robust and correctly processes the constraints and multiple test cases.

However, there is a minor issue in the annotated code that needs to be addressed:

- **Annotation Error**:
  - The annotation mentions a `NameError` because `final_sum` is not defined. This is incorrect. The `final_sum` variable is correctly defined and used in the `func_1` function.
  - The `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, and the `dp` array is correctly indexed to return the result.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases. The minor annotation error does not affect the correctness of the program itself.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
