To provide the output state, I need to understand the loop and the initial state more clearly. However, based on the information given, the loop you've provided is iterating over the `results` list and printing each element. This loop does not modify any variables; it only prints the elements of `results`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`
- `n` is the integer value of the last processed `n` in the loop
- `p` is the list of integers from the last processed segment of `data`
- `data` is a list of strings (unchanged)
- `index` is the total number of elements processed from `data`
- `results` is a list of `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop

Since the loop only prints the elements of `results` and does not modify any variables, the output state after the loop executes all iterations will be the same as the initial state, except that the elements of `results` will have been printed.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the integer value of the last processed `n` in the loop, `p` is the list of integers from the last processed segment of `data`, `data` is a list of strings (unchanged), `index` is the total number of elements processed from `data`, `results` is a list of `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop.**
