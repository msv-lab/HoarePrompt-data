t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the elements of arrays a and b are integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
