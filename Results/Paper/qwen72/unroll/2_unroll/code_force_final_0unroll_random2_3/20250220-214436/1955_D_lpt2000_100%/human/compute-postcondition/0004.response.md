Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `aa` and `bb` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. The function then processes these inputs to determine how many times the number of common elements between the first `m` elements of `aa` and `bb` is at least `k` as the window of `m` elements in `aa` slides from the beginning to the end of the list. The result for each test case is printed to the console. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the function processes each test case independently, resetting all internal variables for each new test case. **
