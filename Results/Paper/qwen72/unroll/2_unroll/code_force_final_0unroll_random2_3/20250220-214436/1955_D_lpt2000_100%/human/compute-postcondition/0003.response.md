The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers where `a` has `n` elements and `b` has `m` elements, with each element in `a` and `b` being an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6 for all i. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers with `a` having `n` elements and `b` having `m` elements, each element being an integer between 1 and 10^6. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not described.**
