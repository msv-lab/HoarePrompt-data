The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `nabors`. The loop will execute if `nabors` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used, so it does not need to be adjusted. For the loop to execute, `nabors` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` and `b` are lists of integers where `a` has `n` elements and `b` has `m` elements, and 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6 for all i; `nabors` must be greater than 0**
