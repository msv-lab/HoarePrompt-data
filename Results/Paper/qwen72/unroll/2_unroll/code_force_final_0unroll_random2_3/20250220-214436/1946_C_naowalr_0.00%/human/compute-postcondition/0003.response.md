The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and `adj` is a list of lists where each sublist represents the adjacency list of a vertex in the tree. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` and `k` are positive integers with `k` less than `n` and both between 1 and 10^5, and `adj` is a list of adjacency lists representing a tree. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified.**
