Output State: **The loop will iterate `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n` and `k` from the input, construct the adjacency list `adj` for a tree with `n` vertices, and then perform a binary search to find the maximum value `L` such that the number of cuts required to split the tree into subtrees of size at least `L` is at most `k`. After all iterations, the final value of `L` for each iteration will be printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj` will be updated for each iteration, but the final state of these variables after the loop will be the state after the last iteration. The variable `L` will be the result of the binary search for the last iteration, and `R` will be `L + 1`. The variable `numCuts` will be the number of cuts required for the last iteration, and `leftover` will be the size of the largest subtree after the cuts for the last iteration.**

Note: The exact values of `n`, `k`, `adj`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` after the loop will depend on the input provided for the last iteration.
