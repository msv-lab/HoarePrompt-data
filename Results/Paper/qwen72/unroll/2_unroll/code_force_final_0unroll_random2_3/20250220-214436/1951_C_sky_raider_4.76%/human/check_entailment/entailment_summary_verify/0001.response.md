### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent the number of days, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day, and the total number of tickets to buy, respectively.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers representing the ticket prices for each day.

2. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The function sorts the list of ticket prices in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to store the number of tickets bought on the current day.
   - The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`. This initialization is incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the problem. The variable `c` should be initialized to 0 to store the total cost.

4. **Ticket Purchase Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each day.
   - Inside the loop, `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`. This ensures that the number of tickets bought on the current day does not exceed the daily limit `m` or the remaining number of tickets `k`.
   - The remaining number of tickets `k` is then decremented by `s`.
   - The total cost `c` is updated by adding the cost of buying `s` tickets on the current day, which is `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. This formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be `l[i] * s` because the cost of buying `s` tickets at price `l[i]` is simply `l[i] * s`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints the integer value of `c`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Initialization of `c`:**
  - The variable `c` should be initialized to 0, not `k * k / 2`.
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation inside the loop should be `c += l[i] * s`, not `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s
        print(c)
```

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4 2 3`, `8 6 4 2`
  - Sorted prices: `2, 4, 6, 8`
  - Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at 2 each, cost = 4, remaining tickets = 1
  - Day 2: Buy 1 ticket at 4 each, cost = 4 + 4 = 8, remaining tickets = 0
  - Total cost = 8

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `4 2 8`, `8 6 4 2`
  - Sorted prices: `2, 4, 6, 8`
  - Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at 2 each, cost = 4, remaining tickets = 6
  - Day 2: Buy 2 tickets at 4 each, cost = 4 + 8 = 12, remaining tickets = 4
  - Day 3: Buy 2 tickets at 6 each, cost = 12 + 12 = 24, remaining tickets = 2
  - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets at 8 each, cost = 24 + 16 = 40, remaining tickets = 0
  - Total cost = 40 (Note: The original output was 64, which is incorrect)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `5 100 1`, `10000 1 100 10 1000`
  - Sorted prices: `1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000`
  - Day 1: Buy 1 ticket at 1 each, cost = 1, remaining tickets = 0
  - Total cost = 1

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `6 3 9`, `5 5 5 5 5 5`
  - Sorted prices: `5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5`
  - Day 1: Buy 3 tickets at 5 each, cost = 15, remaining tickets = 6
  - Day 2: Buy 3 tickets at 5 each, cost = 15 + 15 = 30, remaining tickets = 3
  - Day 3: Buy 3 tickets at 5 each, cost = 30 + 15 = 45, remaining tickets = 0
  - Total cost = 45 (Note: The original output was 72, which is incorrect)

### Conclusion:
The original program has two major issues:
1. The initialization of `c` is incorrect.
2. The cost calculation inside the loop is incorrect.

The corrected program addresses these issues and should produce the correct output for the given test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
