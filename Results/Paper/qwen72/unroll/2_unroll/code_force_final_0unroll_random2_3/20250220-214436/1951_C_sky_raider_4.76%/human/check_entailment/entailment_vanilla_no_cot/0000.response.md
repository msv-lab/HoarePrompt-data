Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Variable `c` Initialization**: The variable `c` is initialized as `k * k / 2`, which is incorrect. The variable `c` should be initialized to 0 to accumulate the total cost of purchasing tickets.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation inside the loop is incorrect. The program adds `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to `c`, which is not the correct way to calculate the cost. The correct way to calculate the cost is to add `l[i] * s` to `c` for the tickets purchased on day `i`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop should continue until all tickets are purchased (`k` becomes 0). The current loop runs for a fixed number of days `n`, which is not necessary. The loop should break once `k` tickets have been purchased.

4. **Ticket Price Increase**: The program does not account for the increase in ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a day. This is a crucial part of the problem, and the program should update the prices accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        
        total_cost = 0
        tickets_bought = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if tickets_bought >= k:
                break
            
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
            total_cost += l[i] * tickets_to_buy
            tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
            
            # Update the prices for the remaining days
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                l[j] += tickets_to_buy
        
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: `total_cost` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total cost, and `tickets_bought` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of tickets purchased so far.
2. **Loop**: The loop iterates over the sorted list of ticket prices. For each day, it calculates the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`), which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost for the tickets bought on the current day is added to `total_cost`.
4. **Update Prices**: The prices for the remaining days are increased by the number of tickets bought on the current day.
5. **Break Condition**: The loop breaks once the required number of tickets (`k`) has been purchased.

This corrected program should now correctly solve the problem as described.
