The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy exactly `k` tickets over `n` sale days, where the price per ticket on each day is given by the list `a`, and the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day is `m`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.
