### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the list of integers `a`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order using `a.sort()` followed by `a.reverse()`. This ensures that the largest elements are at the beginning of the array, which is useful for Alice's strategy to maximize the sum.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum of the array `sum1` is calculated using `sum(a)`.
   - The function then iterates over possible values of elements Alice can remove (from 0 to `k`).

4. **Optimal Moves:**
   - For each possible number of elements Alice removes (`i`), the function calculates the sum after Bob makes his optimal moves.
   - If Alice removes `i` elements, the remaining elements are `a[i:]`.
   - Bob will multiply the smallest `x` elements of the remaining array by -1 to minimize the sum.
   - The function calculates the sum after Bob's moves and appends it to the list `ans`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `i + x - 1 < n`, it means there are enough elements left for Bob to multiply `x` elements by -1.
   - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, it means Bob cannot multiply `x` elements by -1, so the function only adds the value of the element Alice removed.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the maximum value from the list `ans` for each test case, which represents the optimal sum after both players have made their moves.

### Analysis of the Provided Example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `n = 1`, `k = 1`, `x = 1`, `a = [1]`
  - Alice can remove the only element, resulting in a sum of 0.
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `n = 4`, `k = 1`, `x = 1`, `a = [3, 1, 2, 4]`
  - Alice can remove the largest element (4), and Bob will multiply the next largest element (3) by -1.
  - Remaining array: `[1, 2]` with sum `3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2`.
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `n = 6`, `k = 6`, `x = 3`, `a = [1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6]`
  - Alice can remove all elements, resulting in a sum of 0.
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `n = 6`, `k = 6`, `x = 1`, `a = [3, 7, 3, 3, 32, 15]`
  - Alice can remove all elements, resulting in a sum of 0.
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `n = 8`, `k = 5`, `x = 3`, `a = [5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2, 9, 9]`
  - Alice can remove the largest elements `[9, 9, 5, 5, 3]`, and Bob will multiply the next largest elements `[3, 3, 2]` by -1.
  - Remaining array: `[3, 3, 2]` with sum `3 + 3 + 2 - 3 - 3 - 2 = -5`.
  - Output: `-5` (Correct)

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `n = 10`, `k = 6`, `x = 4`, `a = [1, 8, 2, 9, 3, 3, 4, 5, 3, 200]`
  - Alice can remove the largest elements `[200, 9, 8, 5, 4, 3]`, and Bob will multiply the next largest elements `[3, 3, 2, 1]` by -1.
  - Remaining array: `[3, 3, 2, 1]` with sum `3 + 3 + 2 + 1 - 3 - 3 - 2 - 1 = -9`.
  - Output: `-9` (Correct)

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = [4, 3]`
  - Alice can remove all elements, resulting in a sum of 0.
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 8:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `k = 1`, `x = 2`, `a = [1, 3]`
  - Alice can remove the largest element (3), and Bob will multiply the remaining element (1) by -1.
  - Remaining array: `[1]` with sum `1 - 1 = 0`.
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem as described and produces the expected output for the given test cases. The logic for Alice's and Bob's optimal moves is implemented correctly, and the function prints the maximum sum for each test case.
