Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the maximum value from the list `ans` which contains the calculated sums after applying the specified operations. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated and used in each iteration, but their final values after the loop are not relevant to the output. The output state is the sequence of maximum values printed for each test case.**
