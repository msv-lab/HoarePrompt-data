Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a set of `n` constraints. Each constraint is a pair `(a, x)` where `a` is 1, 2, or 3, and `x` is an integer. For each test case, the function calculates the number of valid integers that satisfy the constraints and prints this number. Specifically, it counts the integers that are greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list, and not in the `no` list. If no such integers exist, it prints 0. The function does not return any values, and the state of the input variables `t` and `n` remains unchanged after the function completes. **
