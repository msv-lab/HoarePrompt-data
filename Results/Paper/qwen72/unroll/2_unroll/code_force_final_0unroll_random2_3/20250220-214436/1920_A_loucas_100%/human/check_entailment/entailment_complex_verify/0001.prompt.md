You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the final state of the variables `less`, `big`, `no`, and `num` will be different for each test case based on the inputs provided. However, the variables `t`, `n`, and `loop` will remain unchanged. The output of the loop will be the number of valid integers that satisfy the constraints for each test case, or 0 if no such integers exist.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a set of `n` constraints. Each constraint is a pair `(a, x)` where `a` is 1, 2, or 3, and `x` is an integer. For each test case, the function calculates the number of valid integers that satisfy the constraints and prints this number. Specifically, it counts the integers that are greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list, and not in the `no` list. If no such integers exist, it prints 0. The function does not return any values, and the state of the input variables `t` and `n` remains unchanged after the function completes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases (`loop`).
   - For each test case, it initializes empty lists `less`, `big`, and `no` to store the constraints of types 2, 1, and 3, respectively.
   - It also initializes `num` to 0, which will eventually hold the number of integers that satisfy all constraints.

2. **Reading Constraints:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`innerLoop`).
   - It then reads each constraint and appends the value `a` to the appropriate list based on the type `x`:
     - If `x == 1`, it appends `a` to `big` (k must be greater than or equal to `a`).
     - If `x == 2`, it appends `a` to `less` (k must be less than or equal to `a`).
     - If `x == 3`, it appends `a` to `no` (k must not be equal to `a`).

3. **Calculating the Range:**
   - The function calculates the range of possible values for `k` using `min(less)` and `max(big)`.
   - The number of integers in this range is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.

4. **Handling Type 3 Constraints:**
   - The function then iterates over the `no` list to exclude any values that fall within the calculated range.
   - If a value `i` in `no` is within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`, it decrements `num` by 1.

5. **Output:**
   - If `num` is less than 1, it prints 0, indicating no valid integers.
   - Otherwise, it prints the value of `num`.

### Analysis:
- **Range Calculation:**
  - The range of valid `k` values is correctly calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.
  - This ensures that `k` is within the bounds specified by the type 1 and type 2 constraints.

- **Exclusion of Type 3 Constraints:**
  - The function correctly iterates over the `no` list and excludes any values that fall within the valid range.
  - This ensures that the final count of valid integers does not include those explicitly excluded by type 3 constraints.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the case where the range is invalid (i.e., `min(less) < max(big)`) by printing 0.
  - It also handles the case where the range is valid but all values within the range are excluded by type 3 constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
