Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly handle all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the number of constraints for each test case.
2. **Constraint Collection**: It collects the constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), `less` for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), and `no` for constraints of type 3 (k must not be equal to x).
3. **Range Calculation**: It calculates the range of valid k values by finding the minimum value from the `less` list and the maximum value from the `big` list. The number of valid k values is then calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.
4. **Exclusion of Forbidden Values**: It correctly subtracts the number of forbidden values (those in the `no` list) that fall within the valid range.
5. **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles the case where the calculated range is less than 1 by printing 0, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program seems to work correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
