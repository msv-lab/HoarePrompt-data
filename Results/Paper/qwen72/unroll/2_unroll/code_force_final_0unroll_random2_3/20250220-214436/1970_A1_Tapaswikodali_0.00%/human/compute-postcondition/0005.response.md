The `details` list is sorted based on the tuples it contains. The sorting is done in ascending order by default, which means the tuples will be sorted first by the `balance` value, then by the `-i` value, and finally by the `char` value if the first two are equal. Since `balance` is 0 for all tuples initially, the sorting will primarily be based on the `-i` value, which represents the negative index of the character. Sorting by `-i` will effectively sort the list in reverse order of the original string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is the same non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `balance` is 0; `details` is a list containing tuples of the form (balance, -i, char) sorted in reverse order of the original string `s`.**
