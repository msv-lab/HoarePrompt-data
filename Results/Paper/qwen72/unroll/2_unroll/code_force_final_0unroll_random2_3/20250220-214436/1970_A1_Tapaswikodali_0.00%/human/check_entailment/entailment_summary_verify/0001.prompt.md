You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function takes no parameters and operates on a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")", where `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It reads the string `s` from user input, processes it to maintain a balance of parentheses, and then prints the reverse of the original string `s`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the original string `s` remains unchanged, and the printed output is the reversed string of `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the input string `s` using `input()`. This is appropriate for the problem's input format, which specifies a single line of input containing the parentheses sequence.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The function initializes a variable `balance` to 0 and iterates over each character in the string `s`. For each character:
   - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented by 1.
   - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented by 1.
   - The function appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the list `details`, where `i` is the index of the character. The negative index is used to ensure that when sorting, characters with the same balance are ordered in decreasing order of their positions.

3. **Sorting**: The list `details` is sorted based on the balance and the negative index. This ensures that the columns are sorted in increasing order of prefix balance and, in case of ties, in decreasing order of position.

4. **Result Construction**: The function constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list and joining them into a single string.

5. **Output**: The function prints the result string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The balance calculation correctly tracks the balance of the prefix up to each character.
   - The sorting step correctly orders the characters based on the specified criteria.
   - The result construction correctly forms the balanced shuffle sequence.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the input string is a balanced parentheses sequence, as required by the problem statement.
   - The function also handles the maximum length of the input string (500,000 characters) efficiently, as the operations are linear in time complexity.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
