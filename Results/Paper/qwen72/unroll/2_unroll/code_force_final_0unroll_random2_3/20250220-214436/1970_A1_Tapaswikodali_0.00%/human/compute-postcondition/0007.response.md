To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the variables:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The length of `s` does not exceed 500,000.
   - `balance` is 0.
   - `details` is a list containing tuples of the form `(balance, -i, char)` sorted in reverse order of the original string `s`.
   - `result` is the same as the original string `s` but in reverse order.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, meaning every opening parenthesis "(" has a corresponding closing parenthesis ")".
   - `balance` is initialized to 0, but its exact use in the context of the problem is not specified in the code snippet.
   - `details` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the current balance, the negative index of the character in the original string, and the character itself. This list is sorted in reverse order of the original string `s`.
   - `result` is the reverse of the original string `s`.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - Since `result` is the reverse of `s`, the `print(result)` statement will print the string `s` in reverse order.

4. **Example**:
   - If `s` is "(()())", then `result` will be "())(()".

Given this information, the output of the `print(result)` statement will be the reverse of the original string `s`.

Output: **[reverse of the original string `s`] (where `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and the length of `s` does not exceed 500,000)**
