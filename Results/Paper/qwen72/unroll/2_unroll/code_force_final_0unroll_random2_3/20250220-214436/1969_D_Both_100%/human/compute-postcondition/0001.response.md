The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used in the loop head to determine whether the loop should execute.

State: **`test_cases` must be a positive integer (greater than 0)**
