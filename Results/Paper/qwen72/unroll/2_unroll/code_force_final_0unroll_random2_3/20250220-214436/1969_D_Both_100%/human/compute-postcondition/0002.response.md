Output State: **The loop will have executed `test_cases` times, and for each iteration, the maximum profit (`max_profit`) will be printed. After all iterations, `test_cases` will be 0, and the variables `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined` will be reset to their initial states at the start of each iteration.**
