The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters directly. It relies on the outputs from `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` returns the number of test cases `test_cases` as a non-negative integer. For each test case, `func_2` is called twice: the first call returns two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= n`, and the second call returns two lists of integers `prices` and `bonuses`, each of length `n`, with values in the range `1 <= price, bonus <= 10^9`.

Functionality: **The function `func_4` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists `prices` and `bonuses` of length `n`. It returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints.**
