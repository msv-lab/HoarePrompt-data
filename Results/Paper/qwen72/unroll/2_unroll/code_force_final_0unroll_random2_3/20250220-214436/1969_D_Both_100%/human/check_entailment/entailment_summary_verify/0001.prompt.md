You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists `prices` and `bonuses` of length `n`. It calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved by selecting up to `k` items, where the profit of each item is determined by its price and bonus. The function prints the maximum profit for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the internal variables are reset for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the prices for Alice (`prices`) and the prices for Bob (`bonuses`) using `func_2()`.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - The program creates a list `combined` that pairs the negative of Alice's prices with Bob's prices. This is done to facilitate the use of a min-heap to keep track of the smallest values, which will be useful for Bob's strategy.
   - The `combined` list is sorted by Bob's prices in ascending order. This ensures that the items with the smallest Bob's prices are considered first, which is optimal for Bob's strategy of minimizing Alice's profit.

3. **Heap Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a min-heap `heap` to keep track of the `k` items that Bob will take for free.
   - It also initializes a list `remaining_items` to keep track of the items that are not in the heap.

4. **Heap Population**:
   - The program pushes the first `k` items from the `combined` list into the heap. These items are the ones Bob will take for free, and they are the ones with the smallest Bob's prices.

5. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial profit using `func_3()`, which sums the Bob's prices of the items in the heap and adds the combined profit of the remaining items.
   - It then iterates through the remaining items in `combined` and updates the profit by:
     - Removing the smallest Bob's price from the heap (the one Bob will take for free).
     - Adding the current item to the heap.
     - Adjusting the profit based on the changes in the heap and the current item.
   - The program keeps track of the maximum profit seen so far.

6. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the maximum profit.

### Analysis:
- **Optimality**:
  - Alice wants to maximize her profit, and Bob wants to minimize it.
  - By sorting the items by Bob's prices and using a min-heap to keep track of the `k` items Bob will take for free, the program ensures that Bob always takes the items with the smallest Bob's prices, which minimizes Alice's profit.
  - The program correctly updates the profit by considering the combined profit of the remaining items and the items in the heap.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `k` is 0 by simply summing the Bob's prices of the items Alice buys and subtracting the Alice's prices.
  - It also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` by ensuring that Bob takes all items for free, which results in a profit of 0 if Alice buys all items.

- **Complexity**:
  - The time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step and the heap operations.
  - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for storing the `combined` list and the heap.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for both Alice and Bob acting optimally. It handles the input and output as specified and follows the correct strategy for maximizing Alice's profit while minimizing Bob's contribution.

### Correctness:
**True**
