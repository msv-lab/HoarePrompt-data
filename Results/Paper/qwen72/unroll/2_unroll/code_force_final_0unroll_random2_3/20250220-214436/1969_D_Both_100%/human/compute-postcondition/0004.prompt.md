You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are directly passed to `func_4()`. However, the function relies on the outputs from `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()`. `func_1()` returns the number of test cases `test_cases` as a non-negative integer. `func_2()` is called twice in each test case: the first call returns two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= n`, and the second call returns lists of integers `prices` and `bonuses` each of length `n` with values in the range `1 <= price, bonus <= 10^9`.
def func_4():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        heap = []
        
        remaining_items = []
        
        n, k = func_2()
        
        prices = list(func_2())
        
        neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
        
        bonuses = list(func_2())
        
        max_profit = 0
        
        current_profit = 0
        
        combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
        
        combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
        
        for _ in range(k):
            if combined:
                heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
        
        if combined:
            current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
        
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
        
        while combined:
            item = combined.pop()
            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]
            removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
            if removed_item:
                current_profit -= removed_item[0]
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        
        print(max_profit)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `test_cases` times, and for each iteration, the maximum profit (`max_profit`) will be printed. After all iterations, `test_cases` will be 0, and the variables `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined` will be reset to their initial states at the start of each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_4` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists `prices` and `bonuses` of length `n`. It returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
