You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500), where |s| denotes the length of the string `s`. The string `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: The loop will print the value of `count` for each iteration, which is the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the input string `s`, adjusted by the `flag` variable. The `flag` variable is used to reduce the `count` by 1 if a specific transition ('0' to '1') is found. The variables `i`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, and `j` will be updated during each iteration, but the input integer `t` will remain unchanged. After all iterations, the final value of `t` will be the same as the initial value, and the final value of `s` will be the last input string provided.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to cut the binary string into the minimum number of pieces such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (i.e., all '0's come before all '1's).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `count` to 1, which represents the minimum number of pieces.
   - It uses a `flag` to track if there has been a transition from '0' to '1' in the string.
   - It iterates through the string using a while loop, checking if consecutive characters are different.
   - If a transition from '0' to '1' is found, it sets the `flag` to `True` and increments `j` by 1 to skip the next character.
   - For each transition (whether '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'), it increments the `count`.
   - After the loop, if the `flag` is `True`, it decrements the `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the `count`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies transitions between '0' and '1' and increments the `count` accordingly.
   - The `flag` is used to ensure that the last transition from '0' to '1' is not counted twice, which is a necessary step to avoid overcounting.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted (i.e., all '0's come before all '1's) by not incrementing the `count` unnecessarily.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the string is a single character (either '0' or '1') by printing 1.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For a string with only '0's, the program will correctly print 1.
   - For a string with only '1's, the program will correctly print 1.
   - For a string that is already sorted (e.g., "0001111"), the program will correctly print 1.
   - For a string that requires multiple pieces (e.g., "11010"), the program will correctly print 3.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and handles all the given cases and edge cases as expected.

Correctness: **True**
