Output State: **The loop will execute `kp` times, where `kp` is the integer input at the beginning. For each iteration of the loop, `n` is set to the integer input provided for that iteration. After the loop completes, `v1` will be the largest integer less than `n` for which the first query returned '<', and `prev` will be the largest integer less than `n` for which the second query returned '>'. The final output for each iteration will be `! {prev} {v1}`. The initial state of the lambda function `R` remains unchanged.**
