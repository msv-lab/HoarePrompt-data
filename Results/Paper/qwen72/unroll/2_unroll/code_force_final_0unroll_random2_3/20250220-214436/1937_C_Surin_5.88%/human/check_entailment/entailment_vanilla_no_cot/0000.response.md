Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.

2. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR Value**:
   - The first loop iterates through the indices from 1 to n-1 to find the index `v1` such that `p_v1` has the maximum value. This is done by comparing `p_v1` with `p_i` using the query `? v1 v1 i i`. If `p_v1` is less than `p_i`, `v1` is updated to `i`.

3. **Finding the Second Index for Maximum XOR**:
   - The second loop iterates through the indices from 1 to n-1 to find the index `prev` such that `p_prev` maximizes the XOR with `p_v1`. This is done by comparing `p_v1 | p_i` with `p_v1 | p_prev` using the query `? v1 i v1 prev`. If `p_v1 | p_i` is greater than `p_v1 | p_prev`, `prev` is updated to `i`.

4. **Outputting the Result**:
   - After finding the indices `prev` and `v1`, the program outputs the result in the format `! prev v1`.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The first loop makes at most `n-1` queries.
   - The second loop makes at most `n-1` queries.
   - Therefore, the total number of queries is at most `2n-2`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

6. **Flushing the Output**:
   - The program correctly flushes the output after each query and after printing the final result, ensuring that the interaction with the judge is handled properly.

Given these points, the program is correct and should work as intended for the problem described.
