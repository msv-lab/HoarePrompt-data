Precondition: **The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is a sequence of queries and responses. The sequence p is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} for each test case, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and must output a pair of indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
