Functionality: ** The function `func` operates in an interactive environment to find and output a pair of indices (i, j) from a permutation p of {0, 1, ..., n-1} such that the XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The function reads an integer `kp` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), performs a series of queries to determine the indices, and outputs the pair of indices (i, j) that achieve the maximum XOR value. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the processed test cases with the corresponding pairs of indices printed. **
