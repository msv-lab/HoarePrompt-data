### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal. However, it reads the inputs directly within the function, which is a workaround.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.

2. **Single Screenshot Case:**
   - If there is only one screenshot (`m == 1`), the function prints 'yes' and continues to the next test case. This is correct because a single screenshot always corresponds to a valid order.

3. **Multiple Screenshots Case:**
   - The function reads the first two screenshots and extracts the author and the list of other participants.
   - It then checks if the lists of other participants (excluding the author) are the same. If they are not, it prints 'no' and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if the lists are different, it means the order of participants cannot be consistent.

4. **Finding the Swap Point:**
   - The function attempts to find the point where the first two participants (`a1` and `a2`) swap positions in the lists `l1` and `l2`.
   - It uses the variables `idx1` and `idx2` to track the positions where the swap occurs.
   - If the swap point is found, it adjusts the lists accordingly by inserting the swapped participant at the correct position.

5. **Handling Remaining Screenshots:**
   - The function processes the remaining screenshots and checks if they are consistent with the adjusted list.
   - It uses a list `val` to store the remaining screenshots and their authors.
   - For each remaining screenshot, it checks if the list of participants (excluding the author) matches the adjusted list. If any screenshot does not match, it prints 'no' and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Final Output:**
   - If all remaining screenshots are consistent with the adjusted list, the function prints 'yes'.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the case where there is only one screenshot.
- The function correctly identifies if the first two screenshots are inconsistent.
- The function attempts to find a consistent order by adjusting the lists based on the swap point.
- The function correctly checks the remaining screenshots against the adjusted list.

However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:
- **Function Definition:** The function should be defined with parameters to make it more modular and testable.
- **Edge Cases:** The function does not handle edge cases where the swap point is not found correctly or where the lists are already consistent.
- **Complexity:** The function's complexity is not optimal, especially in the way it processes the remaining screenshots and adjusts the lists.

Despite these issues, the logic of the function is generally correct and should work for the given problem constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The function, while not optimal, correctly implements the logic to determine if the order of participants can be consistently derived from the screenshots. It handles the main cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.
