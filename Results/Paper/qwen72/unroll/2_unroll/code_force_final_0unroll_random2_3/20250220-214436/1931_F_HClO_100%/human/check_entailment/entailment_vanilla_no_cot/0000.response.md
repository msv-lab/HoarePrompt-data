Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output format as specified and processes each test case to determine if there exists a consistent order of participants that matches all the screenshots. Here's a brief explanation of the logic:

1. **Initial Check for Single Screenshot**: If there is only one screenshot, the program directly prints "yes" because a single screenshot is always consistent with itself.

2. **Processing the First Two Screenshots**: The program compares the first two screenshots to identify the relative positions of the authors of these screenshots. It creates two lists, `l11` and `l22`, by removing the authors from the respective lists and checks if these lists are equal. If they are not, it prints "no" and moves to the next test case.

3. **Identifying the Relative Order**: If the lists are equal, the program tries to find the positions where the authors of the first two screenshots should be inserted into each other's lists to make them consistent. It does this by iterating through the lists and comparing elements.

4. **Handling More Than Two Screenshots**: If there are more than two screenshots, the program continues to process the remaining screenshots. It checks if the order of participants in each subsequent screenshot is consistent with the constructed order.

5. **Final Validation**: The program ensures that all remaining screenshots match the constructed order by comparing them with the modified list `l`.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
