The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` and the strings `s` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
