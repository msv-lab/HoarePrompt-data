#State of the program right berfore the function call: fillvalue is a string or any other type that can be used as a fill value in a recursive call.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the `decorating_function`, which is a function or method that was previously defined or assigned in the program. The `fillvalue` is a string or any other type that can be used as a fill value in a recursive call, but it is not used in the return statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `fillvalue` and returns a previously defined or assigned `decorating_function`. The `fillvalue` parameter is not utilized within the function, and the state of the program remains unchanged except for the return of `decorating_function`.
