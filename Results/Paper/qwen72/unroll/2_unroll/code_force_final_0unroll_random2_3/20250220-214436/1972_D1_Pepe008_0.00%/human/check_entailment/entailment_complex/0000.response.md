### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, which are the values of `n` and `m` respectively.

2. **Logic for Calculating Valid Pairs**:
   - The function aims to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The logic inside the loop is:
     ```python
     for i in range(1, b + 1):
         x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
         if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
             suma += x
     ```
     - This loop iterates over possible values of `b` (from 1 to `m`).
     - For each `b`, it calculates `x` as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
     - If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, it adds `x` to `suma`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints `suma - 1` for each test case.
   - The subtraction of 1 is likely to account for some edge case or initialization, but it needs to be verified against the problem statement.

4. **Mathematical Verification**:
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer `k`.
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - The loop in the function is trying to count the number of valid `a` values for each `b` by calculating:
     \[
     x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - This formula is not immediately clear and needs to be checked against the problem statement to ensure it correctly counts the valid pairs.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle the case where `a - i * (i - 1) <= 0` correctly. It should not add `x` to `suma` in such cases.
   - The subtraction of 1 at the end (`print(suma - 1)`) might be incorrect if `suma` is already correctly calculated.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case `1 1`, the only valid pair is `(1, 1)`, and the function should print `1`.
   - For the test case `2 3`, the valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`, and the function should print `3`.
   - For the test case `10 8`, the valid pairs are as listed in the problem statement, and the function should print `14`.

### Conclusion:

The logic in the function is not clearly aligned with the problem statement. The formula used to calculate `x` and the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` do not directly correspond to the problem's requirements. Additionally, the subtraction of 1 at the end might be incorrect.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness:
**False**
