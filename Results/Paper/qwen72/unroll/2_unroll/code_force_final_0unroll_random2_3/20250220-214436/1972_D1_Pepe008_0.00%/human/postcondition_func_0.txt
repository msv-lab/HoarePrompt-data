The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where `1 <= a, b <= 2 * 10^6`. The function then calculates a value `suma` based on these inputs and prints `suma - 1` for each test case. The function does not return any value. The values of `n` and `m` are not modified by the function, as they are not used within the function.
