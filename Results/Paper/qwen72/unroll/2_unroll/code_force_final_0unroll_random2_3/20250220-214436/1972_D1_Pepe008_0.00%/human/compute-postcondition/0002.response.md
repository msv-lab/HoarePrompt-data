Output State: **The value of `T` is unchanged, and the loop prints the value of `suma - 1` for each iteration of `t` in the range from 0 to `T-1`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `T` times, and for each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `a` and `b` from the input.
- It then calculates the value of `suma` based on the given formula and prints `suma - 1`.
- The variables `n` and `m` are not used or modified within the loop, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
