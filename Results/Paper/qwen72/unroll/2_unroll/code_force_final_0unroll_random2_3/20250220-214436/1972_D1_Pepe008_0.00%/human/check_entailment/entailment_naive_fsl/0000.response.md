Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the nested loop that was commented out in the provided code is intended to check all pairs `(i, j)` for the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the actual implementation in the program only considers the range `1` to `b` for `i` and calculates `x` using a formula that does not seem to correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

For example, consider the input `(2, 3)`. According to the problem description, the valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`. However, the program's logic for calculating `x` and summing it does not correctly account for these pairs. The program will output `2` instead of `3` for this input, which is incorrect.

The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checking the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for each pair. The current implementation skips this step and uses a different, incorrect formula.
