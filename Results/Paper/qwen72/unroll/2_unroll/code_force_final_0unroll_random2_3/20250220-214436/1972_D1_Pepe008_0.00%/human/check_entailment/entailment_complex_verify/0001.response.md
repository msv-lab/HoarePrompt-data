### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the nested loop in the commented-out section is incorrect because it starts from 4 instead of 1. However, this loop is not used in the final version of the program.
   - The program uses a different approach to calculate the number of valid pairs:
     - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
     - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) as \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
     - If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to the sum \(suma\).
     - Finally, it prints \(suma - 1\).

4. **Correctness of the Optimization**:
   - The optimization step is derived from a mathematical insight. Let's analyze it:
     - We need \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - This can be rewritten as \((a + b) \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) = 0\).
     - Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot k\) and \(b = d \cdot l\) for some integers \(k\) and \(l\).
     - The condition becomes \((d \cdot k + d \cdot l) \mod (d \cdot l \cdot d) = 0\), which simplifies to \((k + l) \mod (l \cdot d) = 0\).
     - This implies \(k + l\) must be a multiple of \(l \cdot d\).
     - For a fixed \(b = d \cdot l\), \(a\) must be of the form \(d \cdot k\) where \(k\) satisfies the above condition.
     - The number of valid \(a\) values for a fixed \(b\) can be derived from the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\), where \(i\) is \(b\).

5. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\).
   - The term \(i \cdot (i - 1)\) is derived from the fact that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\) and \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The division by \(i^2\) and the addition of 1 are part of the counting mechanism.
   - The condition \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) ensures that the formula is valid and does not result in negative values.

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - The program sums up the valid pairs for each \(b\) and then subtracts 1 from the total sum before printing.
   - The subtraction of 1 is likely to correct for an off-by-one error in the counting mechanism.

### Conclusion:
- The program's logic for counting valid pairs is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.
- The optimization step is mathematically sound and correctly implemented.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
