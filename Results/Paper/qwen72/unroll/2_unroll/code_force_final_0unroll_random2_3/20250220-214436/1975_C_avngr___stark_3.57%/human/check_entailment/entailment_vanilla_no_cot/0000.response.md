Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It attempts to find the maximum value of the minimum of adjacent pairs in the array, which is not the correct approach to determine the maximum possible value that the array can be filled with after performing the allowed operations.

The correct approach involves understanding that the maximum value the array can be filled with is the median of the entire array. This is because the median of any subarray chosen will always be a value that is present in the array, and by repeatedly applying the operation, we can eventually fill the entire array with the median value.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        median = a[n // 2]
        print(median)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program sorts the array and then selects the median value, which is the value at the middle index of the sorted array. This value is the maximum possible value that the array can be filled with after performing the operations as described.
