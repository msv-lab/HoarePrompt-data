To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `ii` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which should be the number of test cases `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.

The loop head:
```
for ii in range(int(input())):
```

For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is the number of test cases and it is given that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `int(input())` should be equal to `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is at least 1 and `ii` is 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0, `int(input())` must be equal to `t` and greater than 0**
