Output State: **For each test case, the loop calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by using the available coins. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are not directly modified by the loop, but the loop processes each test case and prints the result. After all iterations of the loop, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain as they were initially, but the loop has printed the results for each test case.**
