### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum `s` of the array `a`.

3. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes two variables `t` and `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array `a` and calculates the maximum subarray sum `t` using a dynamic programming approach.
   - `tmp` is used to keep track of the current subarray sum, and if `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to 0.
   - `t` is updated to the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`.

4. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is calculated as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
   - This ensures that the sum is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` and is non-negative.

5. **Operations Loop:**
   - The program then performs `k - 1` operations.
   - In each operation, it doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` and takes it modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - It adds this doubled value to `ans` and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

6. **Output:**
   - The final answer `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Initial Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum `s` of the array `a` is correctly calculated.

- **Correctness of Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
  - The maximum subarray sum `t` is correctly calculated using a dynamic programming approach. This approach ensures that the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray is found, which is crucial for the problem.

- **Correctness of Initial Answer Calculation:**
  - The initial answer `ans` is correctly calculated as the sum of the array plus the maximum subarray sum, taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

- **Correctness of Operations Loop:**
  - The loop correctly doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` for each of the `k - 1` operations and adds it to `ans`.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the values do not overflow and remain within the required range.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, taking into account the constraints and the modulo operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
