Output State: **`T` is the integer value read from the standard input, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are integers representing the length of the array and the number of operations (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `MOD` is 1000000007.**
