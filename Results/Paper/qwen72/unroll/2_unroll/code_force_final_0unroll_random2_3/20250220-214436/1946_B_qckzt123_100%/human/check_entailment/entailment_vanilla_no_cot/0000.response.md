Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

1. **Initial Calculation of `s` and `t`:**
   - `s` is the sum of the array `a`.
   - `t` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of `a` that is non-negative.

2. **First Operation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the initial maximum possible sum after the first operation as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.

3. **Subsequent Operations:**
   - The program then tries to double `t` for each subsequent operation and add it to `ans`. This is incorrect because the maximum sum of the array after each operation is not simply doubling `t` and adding it to `ans`.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach should consider the following:
- If the sum of the array `s` is non-negative, the maximum possible sum after `k` operations is `s * (2^k - 1) % MOD`.
- If the sum of the array `s` is negative, the maximum possible sum after `k` operations is the maximum subarray sum `t` multiplied by `2^k % MOD`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import sys

def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, k) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
        a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
        s = sum(a)
        t = 0
        tmp = 0
        for x in a:
            tmp += x
            if tmp < 0:
                tmp = 0
            t = max(tmp, t)
        
        if s >= 0:
            ans = s * ((1 << k) - 1) % MOD
        else:
            ans = t * ((1 << k) % MOD) % MOD
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Calculation of `s` and `t`:**
  - `s` is the sum of the array `a`.
  - `t` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of `a` that is non-negative.

- **Final Calculation:**
  - If `s` is non-negative, the maximum possible sum after `k` operations is `s * (2^k - 1) % MOD`.
  - If `s` is negative, the maximum possible sum after `k` operations is `t * (2^k % MOD) % MOD`.

This corrected approach ensures that the program correctly handles the maximum possible sum after `k` operations for both positive and negative sums of the array.
