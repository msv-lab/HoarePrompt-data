You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take no input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be defined to take input parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are integers representing the length of the array and the number of operations (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(T):

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the final output state is that `T` is the initial integer value read from the standard input, `t` is the initial number of test cases, `n` and `k` are the last values read for the final test case, `a` is the last list of integers read for the final test case, and `ans` is the final computed answer for the last test case. The variables `s`, `tmp`, and `t` are no longer relevant after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an array `a` of length `n` and an integer `k` from the standard input. It computes a value `ans` based on the sum of the array and the maximum subarray sum that does not drop below zero, then applies `k` operations to this value. The result for each test case is printed to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and their results printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum `s` of the array `a`.

3. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes two variables `t` and `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array `a` and calculates the maximum subarray sum `t` using a dynamic programming approach.
   - `tmp` is used to keep track of the current subarray sum, and if `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to 0.
   - `t` is updated to the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`.

4. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is calculated as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
   - This ensures that the sum is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` and is non-negative.

5. **Operations Loop:**
   - The program then performs `k - 1` operations.
   - In each operation, it doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` and takes it modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - It adds this doubled value to `ans` and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

6. **Output:**
   - The final answer `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Initial Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum `s` of the array `a` is correctly calculated.

- **Correctness of Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
  - The maximum subarray sum `t` is correctly calculated using a dynamic programming approach. This approach ensures that the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray is found, which is crucial for the problem.

- **Correctness of Initial Answer Calculation:**
  - The initial answer `ans` is correctly calculated as the sum of the array plus the maximum subarray sum, taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

- **Correctness of Operations Loop:**
  - The loop correctly doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` for each of the `k - 1` operations and adds it to `ans`.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the values do not overflow and remain within the required range.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, taking into account the constraints and the modulo operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
