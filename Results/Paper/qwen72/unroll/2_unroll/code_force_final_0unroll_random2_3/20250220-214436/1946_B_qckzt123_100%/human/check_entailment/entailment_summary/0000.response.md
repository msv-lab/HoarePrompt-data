### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to perform `k` operations on an array `a` of `n` integers.
   - In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray (including an empty subarray) and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations and output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
   - It calculates the sum of the array `s` and the maximum subarray sum `t` that does not drop below zero.
   - The initial answer `ans` is computed as \((s + t) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, it doubles the value of `t` and adds it to `ans`, taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) each time.

3. **Key Points:**
   - **Sum Calculation:** The sum `s` of the array is correctly calculated.
   - **Maximum Subarray Sum:** The maximum subarray sum `t` that does not drop below zero is correctly calculated using a dynamic programming approach.
   - **Initial Answer:** The initial answer `ans` is correctly computed as \((s + t) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - **Operations:** The function correctly doubles `t` and adds it to `ans` for `k-1` operations, ensuring the result is always taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Empty Subarray:** The function correctly handles the case where the maximum subarray sum is zero (i.e., all elements are negative or the array is empty).
   - **Large Values:** The function uses modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large values, ensuring that the result does not overflow.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - **First Test Case:** For `a = [-4, -7]` and `k = 2`, the sum `s` is \(-11\) and the maximum subarray sum `t` is \(0\). The initial answer is \((s + t) \mod (10^9 + 7) = -11 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 999999996\). No further operations change this value.
   - **Second Test Case:** For `a = [2, 2, 8]` and `k = 3`, the sum `s` is \(12\) and the maximum subarray sum `t` is \(12\). The initial answer is \((s + t) \mod (10^9 + 7) = 24\). After two more operations, `t` is doubled and added to `ans`, resulting in \(24 + 24 + 48 = 96\).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the result is within the required range.
   - The function handles edge cases and large values appropriately.
