The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks for each test case, and each stick length a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) is a positive integer.
