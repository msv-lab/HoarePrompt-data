You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks for each test case, and each stick length a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) is a positive integer.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}

                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1

            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `w` times, each time reading a new line of input for the number of sticks `ln` and the stick lengths `palka`. For each test case, it will count the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times and print this count. After `w` iterations, the loop will terminate, and the variables `w`, `t`, and the list of lists will remain unchanged. The variable `shapes` will be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, so its final value will be 0 after the loop terminates. The dictionaries `d` and lists `pl` will also be reset in each iteration, so they will not retain any values after the loop ends.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `w`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the lengths of the sticks `palka`.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It also maintains a list `pl` to keep track of unique stick lengths.

3. **Shape Counting:**
   - The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length `j`, it checks if the frequency `d[j]` is at least 3.
   - If the frequency is at least 3, it increments the `shapes` counter by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of shapes that can be formed for each test case.

### Issues:

1. **Incorrect Shape Counting:**
   - The program assumes that any stick length with a frequency of at least 3 can form a regular polygon. However, this is incorrect because:
     - A regular polygon with 3 sides (equilateral triangle) requires exactly 3 sticks.
     - A regular polygon with 4 sides (square) requires exactly 4 sticks.
     - A regular polygon with 5 sides (pentagon) requires exactly 5 sticks.
     - And so on.
   - The program should check if the frequency of a stick length is at least the number of sides of the polygon, and it should also ensure that the number of sticks used is a multiple of the number of sides.

2. **Optimal Shape Formation:**
   - The program does not consider the optimal way to form polygons. For example, if there are 6 sticks of length 3, it should form 2 squares (each requiring 4 sticks) and 1 triangle (requiring 3 sticks), but the current logic would only count 1 shape.

### Correct Solution:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- For each unique stick length, determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with that length.
- Sum the maximum number of polygons for all unique stick lengths.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
        shapes = 0
        for j in d:
            for sides in range(3, ln + 1):
                if d[j] >= sides:
                    shapes += d[j] // sides
        print(shapes)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
- **Frequency Counting:** The dictionary `d` is used to count the frequency of each stick length.
- **Shape Counting:** For each unique stick length `j`, the program iterates over possible polygon sides from 3 to `ln` (the number of sticks). It checks if the frequency `d[j]` is at least the number of sides `sides`. If so, it adds the maximum number of such polygons (`d[j] // sides`) to the `shapes` counter.
- **Output:** The program prints the total number of shapes that can be formed for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the number of sides required for each polygon and does not optimize the formation of multiple polygons from the same stick length.
