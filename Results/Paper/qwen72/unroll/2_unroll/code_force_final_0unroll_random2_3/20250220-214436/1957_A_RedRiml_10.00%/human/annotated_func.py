#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks for each test case, and each stick length a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) is a positive integer.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `w` times, each time reading a new line of input for the number of sticks `ln` and the stick lengths `palka`. For each test case, it will count the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times and print this count. After `w` iterations, the loop will terminate, and the variables `w`, `t`, and the list of lists will remain unchanged. The variable `shapes` will be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, so its final value will be 0 after the loop terminates. The dictionaries `d` and lists `pl` will also be reset in each iteration, so they will not retain any values after the loop ends.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to process a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` (1 ≤ ln ≤ 100) indicating the number of sticks, followed by a list of `ln` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The function then counts the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times in each test case and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value. The variables `w`, `t`, and the list of lists remain unchanged, and the internal variables `d`, `pl`, and `shapes` are reset for each test case.
