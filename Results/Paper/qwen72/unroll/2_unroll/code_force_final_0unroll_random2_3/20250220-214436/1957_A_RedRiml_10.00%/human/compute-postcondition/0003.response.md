The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `sticks`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The list `sticks` contains `t` inner lists, each representing a set of stick lengths for a test case. Each inner list contains `n` integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) represents the length of a stick. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates whether it is possible to form a square using the sticks in that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `sticks` where each inner list contains `n` integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks for each test case, and each stick length `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) is a positive integer. It returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether it is possible to form a square using the sticks in the corresponding test case.**
