You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks for each test case, and each stick length a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) is a positive integer.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `w` times, each time reading a new line of input for the number of sticks `ln` and the stick lengths `palka`. For each test case, it will count the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times and print this count. After `w` iterations, the loop will terminate, and the variables `w`, `t`, and the list of lists will remain unchanged. The variable `shapes` will be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, so its final value will be 0 after the loop terminates. The dictionaries `d` and lists `pl` will also be reset in each iteration, so they will not retain any values after the loop ends.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `sticks` where each inner list contains `n` integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks for each test case, and each stick length `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) is a positive integer. It returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether it is possible to form a square using the sticks in the corresponding test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
