### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell will move left or right based on the character in that cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each starting with a pinball on the i-th cell, and output the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is a helper function that calculates the difference between the last element in the array and the element at a specific index after applying the `max` function to ensure the index is within bounds.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the grid and calculates the time for each query.

3. **Detailed Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of indices where the character is '>', initialized with an extra 0 at the beginning.
     - `suffZero` is a list initialized with 0, which will store cumulative sums of indices where the character is '<'.
     - `ans` is a list of size `n` initialized with 0, which will store the results for each query.

   - **Loop through the grid in reverse:**
     - For each cell `i` from `n-1` to `0`:
       - If the character is '>', it means the pinball will move to the right.
         - The program calculates the number of '>' and '<' characters to the right of the current cell.
         - It uses `func_1` to get the cumulative sums and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
         - It updates `preOne` and `totalOne` to reflect the removal of the current cell from the list of '>' characters.
       - If the character is '<', it means the pinball will move to the left.
         - The program updates `suffZero` with the cumulative sum of the current index.
         - It calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums and the number of '>' and '<' characters.
         - It updates `ans` with the calculated time.

   - **Output:**
     - The program prints the results for each query.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the characters.
   - The use of cumulative sums (`preOne` and `suffZero`) helps in efficiently calculating the time for each query.
   - The logic for handling the different cases (pinball moving left or right) is implemented correctly.
   - The program ensures that the pinball always leaves the grid within a finite number of steps.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the time for each pinball to leave the grid using cumulative sums and handles the inversion of characters correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
