Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Percentages**:
   - The program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` as percentages, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect comparisons. The problem requires checking if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, which can be done directly by comparing counts.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the edge cases where the road can be laid before the first house (i.e., `i = 0`) or after the last house (i.e., `i = n`).

3. **Unnecessary Complexity**:
   - The program uses a list `lst` to store all valid positions and then finds the minimum distance to the middle. This is more complex than necessary. A simpler approach would be to directly track the best position and its distance to the middle.

### Correct Approach:
- For each possible position `i` (from 0 to `n-1`), calculate the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides.
- Check if the number of zeros on the left side is at least half of the left side and the number of ones on the right side is at least half of the right side.
- Track the position that is closest to the middle of the village and satisfies the conditions.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        # Count the total number of zeros and ones
        total_zeros = s.count('0')
        total_ones = s.count('1')
        
        # Initialize the best position and its distance to the middle
        best_position = 0
        min_distance = float('inf')
        
        # Initialize the counts of zeros and ones on the left side
        left_zeros = 0
        left_ones = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Calculate the number of zeros and ones on the right side
            right_zeros = total_zeros - left_zeros
            right_ones = total_ones - left_ones
            
            # Check if the current position satisfies the conditions
            if left_zeros >= (i + 1) // 2 and right_ones >= (n - i) // 2:
                # Calculate the distance to the middle
                distance = abs(n // 2 - i)
                # Update the best position if this one is better
                if distance < min_distance:
                    best_position = i
                    min_distance = distance
                elif distance == min_distance:
                    best_position = min(best_position, i)
            
            # Update the counts for the next position
            if s[i] == '0':
                left_zeros += 1
            else:
                left_ones += 1
        
        # Print the best position
        print(best_position)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**: We initialize `best_position` to 0 and `min_distance` to infinity. We also count the total number of zeros and ones in the string `s`.
- **Loop**: We iterate through each possible position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
  - For each position, we calculate the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides.
  - We check if the current position satisfies the conditions.
  - If it does, we calculate the distance to the middle and update `best_position` if this position is closer to the middle.
- **Output**: After the loop, we print the `best_position`.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem.
