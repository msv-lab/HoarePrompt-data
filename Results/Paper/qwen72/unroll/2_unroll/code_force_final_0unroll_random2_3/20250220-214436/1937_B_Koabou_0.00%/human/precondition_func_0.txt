The function should take three parameters: a positive integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each n[i] is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list of tuples grid where each grid[i] contains two binary strings representing the rows of the 2 × n[i] grid. The total sum of all n[i] values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
