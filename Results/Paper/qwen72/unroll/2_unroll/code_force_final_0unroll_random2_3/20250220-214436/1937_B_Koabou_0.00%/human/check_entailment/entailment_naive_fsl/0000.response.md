Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. Specifically, the variable `t` is used to count the number of paths, but the logic for updating `t` is incorrect. The program does not correctly account for all possible paths that can yield the lexicographically smallest string.

**Case where the program fails:**

Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0010
0000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
00000
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
00000
1
```

**Explanation:**
- The lexicographically smallest string is `00000`, which can be achieved by two paths: 
  1. Moving right, right, down, right.
  2. Moving down, right, right, right.
- However, the program only counts one path, which is incorrect.

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the case where multiple paths can yield the same lexicographically smallest string.
