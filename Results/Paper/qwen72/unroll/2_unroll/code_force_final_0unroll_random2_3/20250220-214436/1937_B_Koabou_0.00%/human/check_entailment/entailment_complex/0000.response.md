### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and two binary strings representing the rows of the grid.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the grid to find the first position where the second row has a '0' and the first row has a '1' immediately after it.
   - If such a position is found, it concatenates the prefix of the first row up to that position with the suffix of the second row starting from that position.
   - If no such position is found, it concatenates the entire first row with the last character of the second row. This ensures that the lexicographically smallest string is formed by taking the smallest possible values at each step.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The function initializes `t` to 1, which will be used to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It then iterates through the string `s` to find the longest prefix of the first row that matches the prefix of `s`.
   - The value of `t` is updated based on the position where the prefix of the first row matches the prefix of `s`. This is intended to count the number of valid paths that can form the string `s`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the lexicographically smallest string `s` and the number of paths `t` that yield this string.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Path Counting**:
  - The logic for counting the number of paths is flawed. The variable `t` is updated based on the position where the prefix of the first row matches the prefix of `s`, but this does not correctly count the number of valid paths.
  - The correct approach to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string should consider all possible paths that can form the string `s`.

### Corrected Approach:
- To correctly count the number of paths, we need to consider the following:
  - If the lexicographically smallest string is formed by taking the first row entirely, then there is only one path.
  - If the smallest string is formed by switching to the second row at some position, then the number of paths is the number of positions where the switch can occur.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly finds the lexicographically smallest string but incorrectly counts the number of paths that yield this string.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program needs to be corrected to properly count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
