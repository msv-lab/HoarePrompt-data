The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `grid`. 

- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is a list of integers where each `n[i]` is the width of the grid for the i-th test case, with the constraint 2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `grid` is a list of tuples, where each `grid[i]` contains two binary strings representing the rows of the 2 × n[i] grid.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if the two binary strings in the grid can be transformed into each other by flipping any number of columns. If they can, the function returns "Yes" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` where each `n[i]` is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list of tuples `grid` where each `grid[i]` contains two binary strings representing the rows of the 2 × n[i] grid. It returns a list of results, where each result is "Yes" if the two binary strings in the grid can be transformed into each other by flipping any number of columns, and "No" otherwise.**
