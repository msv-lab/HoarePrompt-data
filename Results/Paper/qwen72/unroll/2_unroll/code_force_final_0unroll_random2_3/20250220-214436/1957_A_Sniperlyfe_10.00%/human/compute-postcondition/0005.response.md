Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each inner list starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique `n` value by 4. The final state of the program includes a dictionary `freq` that maps each unique `n` value to its frequency in the input `arr`. **
