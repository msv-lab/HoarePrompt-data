The only objects in the loop head are `n` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one inner list, the loop will execute. The variable `n` will be the first inner list in `arr` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of lists that must have at least one inner list, `n` is the first inner list in `arr`**
