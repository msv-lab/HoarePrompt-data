You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates t times, where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20. For each iteration, an integer n is provided such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `casos` times, and for each iteration, it will print a pattern based on the value of `n` provided. If `n` is 1, it will print two lines of '##'. If `n` is 2, it will print four lines of '##..' followed by four lines of '..##'. If `n` is 3, it will print six lines of '##..##' followed by six lines of '..##..'. If `n` is 4, it will print eight lines of '##..##..' followed by eight lines of '..##..##'. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it will print 'No esta en el rango'. The value of `c` will be `casos - 1` after the loop finishes, and the value of `n` will be the last input provided. The value of `casos` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` is designed to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 20. For each iteration, the function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. The function returns a value based on the input `n`, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
