### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) in the array \(a\) such that:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).
   - For each number \(a_i\) in the array:
     - Calculate \(a_i \% x\) and \(a_i \% y\).
     - Determine the required values for \(a_j\) such that:
       - \((a_i + a_j) \% x = 0\) which implies \(a_j \% x = (x - a_i \% x) \% x\).
       - \((a_i - a_j) \% y = 0\) which implies \(a_j \% y = a_i \% y\).
     - Check if the required pair \((a_j \% x, a_j \% y)\) is already in the frequency dictionary `freq`.
     - If it is, add the frequency of this pair to the `beautiful_count`.
     - Update the frequency dictionary with the current pair \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - The `freq` dictionary is initialized correctly.
     - The `beautiful_count` is initialized to 0 for each test case.
   - **Loop Through Array:**
     - The program correctly calculates the required values for \(a_j\) based on the current \(a_i\).
     - It checks if the required pair is in the frequency dictionary and updates the count accordingly.
     - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair.
   - **Output:**
     - The program appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list after processing each test case.
     - The `results` list is returned at the end, which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \(x\) and \(y\) are different.
   - It correctly processes arrays of different lengths.
   - The program prints intermediate steps for debugging, which can be useful but are not necessary for correctness.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a dictionary to store frequencies, which allows for efficient lookups and updates (O(1) on average).
   - The overall time complexity is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
  - `test_cases` is a list of dictionaries, each containing:
    - `params`: a tuple \((n, x, y)\) where \(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \le x, y \le 10^9\).
    - `array`: a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).
  - The sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

- **Inside the function:**
  - **Initialization:**
    - `results` is initialized as an empty list.
    - For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted from `case['params']`.
    - `a` is extracted from `case['array']`.
    - `freq` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
    - `beautiful_count` is initialized to 0.
  - **Processing each number in the array:**
    - For each `num` in `a`:
      - `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`.
      - `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
      - `required_mod_x` is calculated as \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
      - `required_mod_y` is set to `mod_y`.
      - The program checks if the pair \((required_mod_x, required_mod_y)\) is in `freq`.
      - If it is, the frequency of this pair is added to `beautiful_count`.
      - The program updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair \((mod_x, mod_y)\).
  - **Output:**
    - The program appends `beautiful_count` to `results` after processing each test case.
    - The `results` list is returned at the end.
