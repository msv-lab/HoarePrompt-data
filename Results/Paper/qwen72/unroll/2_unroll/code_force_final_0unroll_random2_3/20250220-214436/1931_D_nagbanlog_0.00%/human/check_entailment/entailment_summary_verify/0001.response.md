### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).
   - For each number \(a_i\) in the array:
     - Calculate \(a_i \% x\) and \(a_i \% y\).
     - Determine the required values for \(a_j\) such that:
       - \((a_i + a_j) \% x = 0\) which implies \(a_j \% x = (x - a_i \% x) \% x\).
       - \((a_i - a_j) \% y = 0\) which implies \(a_j \% y = a_i \% y\).
     - Check if the required pair \((a_j \% x, a_j \% y)\) is already in the frequency dictionary `freq`.
     - If it is, add the frequency of this pair to the `beautiful_count`.
     - Update the frequency dictionary with the current pair \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - The `freq` dictionary is initialized correctly.
     - The `beautiful_count` is initialized to 0 for each test case.
   - **Loop Through Array:**
     - The program correctly calculates the required values for \(a_j\) based on the current \(a_i\).
     - It checks if the required pair is in the frequency dictionary and updates the count accordingly.
     - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair.
   - **Output:**
     - The program appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list after processing each test case.
     - The `results` list is returned at the end, which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \(x\) and \(y\) are different.
   - It correctly processes arrays of different lengths.
   - The program prints intermediate steps for debugging, which can be useful but are not necessary for correctness.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a dictionary to store frequencies, which allows for efficient lookups and updates (O(1) on average).
   - The overall time complexity is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function Summary:**
  - The function `func_1` processes each test case by iterating through the array and using a frequency dictionary to count beautiful pairs.
  - The key insight is that for a pair \((a_i, a_j)\) to be beautiful, \(a_j\) must satisfy two conditions:
    - \(a_j \% x = (x - a_i \% x) \% x\)
    - \(a_j \% y = a_i \% y\)
  - The program correctly checks these conditions and updates the count of beautiful pairs.

- **Potential Issues:**
  - The function summary and the original assessment both correctly describe the logic and implementation.
  - However, the function summary states that the pair \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\) should be checked against \((a_j \% x, a_j \% y)\) where:
    - \(a_j \% x = (x - a_i \% x) \% x\)
    - \(a_j \% y = a_i \% y\)
  - The implementation in the program matches this logic.

- **Verification:**
  - The program correctly initializes the frequency dictionary and the beautiful count.
  - It correctly calculates the required values for \(a_j\) and checks if they exist in the frequency dictionary.
  - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair.
  - The program appends the beautiful count to the results list after processing each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The reasoning and implementation are sound, and the program should produce the correct output for the given problem description.
