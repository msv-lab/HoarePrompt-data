### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Set Creation:**
   - The program creates a set `a` from the string `s` to determine the unique characters in `s`.

3. **Single Character Check:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same. In this case, it is impossible to rearrange the string to form a new string that is not equal to `s`. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

4. **Rearrangement Logic:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are at least two different characters in `s`.
   - The program then sorts the string `s` to create a new string `b` and sorts it in reverse to create another string `c`.
   - It checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`.
     - If `b` is equal to `s`, it means the original string `s` is already in sorted order. In this case, the program prints the reverse sorted string `c` to ensure the new string is different from `s`.
     - If `b` is not equal to `s`, it means the sorted string `b` is different from `s`. The program prints `b` as the new string.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints "YES" followed by the rearranged string if a valid rearrangement is possible.
   - It prints "NO" if no valid rearrangement is possible.

### Analysis:
- The program handles the case where all characters are the same correctly by printing "NO".
- For strings with at least two different characters, the program ensures that the rearranged string is different from the original string by either printing the sorted string or the reverse sorted string.
- The logic is sound and covers all the required cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided reasoning.

Correctness: **True**
