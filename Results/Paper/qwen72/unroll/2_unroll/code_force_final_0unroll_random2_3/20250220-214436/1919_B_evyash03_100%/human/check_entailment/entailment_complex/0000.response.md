Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` (derived from the string `s` where `+` is 1 and `-` is -1) into subarrays. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to minimize the total penalty.

The provided function `func_1` calculates the number of `+` characters and the number of `-` characters in the string `expression`. It then returns the absolute difference between these two counts. However, this approach does not address the problem's requirement of splitting the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

1. **Optimal Splitting**: The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to split it such that each subarray has a sum of 0. If a subarray has a sum of 0, its penalty is 0. If it's not possible to have all subarrays with a sum of 0, we should try to minimize the absolute sum of each subarray.

2. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray is the absolute sum of its elements multiplied by its length. Therefore, we should aim to create as many subarrays with a sum of 0 as possible, and for the remaining subarrays, we should minimize their penalties.

The provided function does not perform any splitting of the array. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty.

Let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

- For `s = "+"`, the array `a` is `[1]`. The optimal split is `([1])`, and the penalty is `1 * 1 = 1`. The function returns `1`, which is correct in this case.
- For `s = "-----"`, the array `a` is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`. The optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])`, and the penalty is `1 * 5 = 5`. The function returns `5`, which is correct in this case.
- For `s = "+-+-+-"`, the array `a` is `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`. The optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, and the penalty is `0 * 4 + 0 * 2 = 0`. The function returns `0`, which is correct in this case.
- For `s = "--+++++++-"`, the array `a` is `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]`. The optimal split is `([-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, and the penalty is `|1| * 8 = 8`. However, the function returns `4`, which is incorrect.
- For `s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"`, the array `a` is `[1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1]`. The optimal split is more complex, but the function returns `4`, which is incorrect.

The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to split the array and calculate the minimum penalty. It only calculates the difference between the counts of `+` and `-` characters, which is not the same as the minimum penalty.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
