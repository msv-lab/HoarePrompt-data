The only objects in the loop head are `char` and `expression`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If the `expression` has at least one character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `count` is 0, and `length` is a positive integer that equals the length of `expression`. For the loop to execute, `expression` must have at least one character, and `char` will be the first character of `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting only of '+' and '-' characters and must have at least one character, `char` is the first character of `expression`, `count` is 0, `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `length` <= 5000 and `length` equals the length of `expression`**
