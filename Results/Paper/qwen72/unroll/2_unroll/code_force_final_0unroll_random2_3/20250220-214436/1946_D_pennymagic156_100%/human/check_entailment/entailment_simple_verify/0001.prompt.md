You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

    #The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. Since `a` is an empty list, its length is 0. `ans` is the maximum count of integers in `a` that have the same bit set at the highest position where `x` has a 0 bit and the sum of the bits at that position in `a` is even. However, since `a` is empty, `ans` must be 0. Therefore, the program returns 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses a series of functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) to handle input. However, these functions are not used in the main logic of the program. The function `func_5` is the one that processes each test case.
   - The function `func_3` reads two integers `n` and `x` from the input.
   - The function `func_1` reads a list of integers `a` from the input.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_5` initializes an empty list `t` and a variable `ans` set to -1.
   - It iterates over the bits from 29 to 0 (since \(0 \le x < 2^{30}\)).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - It extracts the `i`-th bit of `x` and the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.
     - If both `u` and `v` are 0, it continues to the next bit.
     - If `u` is 0 and `v` is odd, it returns `ans` immediately because it is impossible to satisfy the condition with an odd number of 1s in the `i`-th bit.
     - If `u` is 0 and `v` is even, it performs a series of operations to group the elements of `a` based on the `i`-th bit and updates `t` and `a`.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is odd, it continues to the next bit.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is even, it counts the number of segments where the `i`-th bit is 0 and updates `ans` with the maximum count.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is 0, it breaks the loop.

3. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - The program uses bitwise operations to check the `i`-th bit of `x` and the elements of `a`.
   - It uses XOR and OR operations to group the elements and count the segments.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of `a` is odd, which correctly returns -1.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of `a` is even, which correctly groups the elements and updates `t` and `a`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - It correctly handles the edge cases and the main logic for each bit position.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning steps. It correctly processes the input and applies the necessary bitwise operations to determine the maximum number of segments `k`.

Correctness: **True**
