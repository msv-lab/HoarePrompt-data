Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < 2^30.** 

The values of `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_3()`. The list `a` remains unchanged, and it still contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies the condition 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < 2^30.
