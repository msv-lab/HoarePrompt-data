### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an integer `x`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a`.
   - The functions `func_3` and `func_1` are used to read these inputs. `func_3` reads `n` and `x` as a tuple of integers, and `func_1` reads the list `a` as a list of integers.

2. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - The function `func_5` processes each test case by iterating over the bits of `x` from the most significant bit (29) to the least significant bit (0).
   - For each bit position `i`, it checks if the bit is set in `x` and if the sum of the bits at position `i` in the array `a` is even or odd.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - If the bit at position `i` in `x` is 0 and the sum of bits at position `i` in `a` is odd, it returns the current value of `ans` because it is impossible to form valid segments that satisfy the condition.
   - If the bit at position `i` in `x` is 0 and the sum of bits at position `i` in `a` is even, it tries to form segments where the XOR of the segment elements at position `i` is 0. It then appends the cumulative XOR of these segments to the list `t` and resets the cumulative XOR.
   - If the bit at position `i` in `x` is 1 and the sum of bits at position `i` in `a` is even, it counts the number of segments where the XOR of the segment elements at position `i` is 0 and updates `ans` with the maximum count.

4. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all bit positions, the function returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. Since `a` is empty by the time the function concludes, the length of `a` is 0, and the function effectively returns `ans`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where no valid segments can be formed, returning -1.
   - It also handles the case where the entire array `a` can be used as a single segment, which is the maximum possible value of `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number `k` of segments such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`. The input handling, bitwise operations, and condition checking are all implemented correctly, and the program handles edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
