### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses a series of functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) to handle input. However, these functions are not used in the main logic of the program. The function `func_5` is the one that processes each test case.
   - The function `func_3` reads two integers `n` and `x` from the input.
   - The function `func_1` reads a list of integers `a` from the input.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_5` initializes an empty list `t` and a variable `ans` set to -1.
   - It iterates over the bits from 29 to 0 (since \(0 \le x < 2^{30}\)).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - It extracts the `i`-th bit of `x` and the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.
     - If both `u` and `v` are 0, it continues to the next bit.
     - If `u` is 0 and `v` is odd, it returns `ans` immediately because it is impossible to satisfy the condition with an odd number of 1s in the `i`-th bit.
     - If `u` is 0 and `v` is even, it performs a series of operations to group the elements of `a` based on the `i`-th bit and updates `t` and `a`.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is odd, it continues to the next bit.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is even, it counts the number of segments where the `i`-th bit is 0 and updates `ans` with the maximum count.
     - If `u` is 1 and `v` is 0, it breaks the loop.

3. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - The program uses bitwise operations to check the `i`-th bit of `x` and the elements of `a`.
   - It uses XOR and OR operations to group the elements and count the segments.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of `a` is odd, which correctly returns -1.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of `a` is even, which correctly groups the elements and updates `t` and `a`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - It correctly handles the edge cases and the main logic for each bit position.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning steps. It correctly processes the input and applies the necessary bitwise operations to determine the maximum number of segments `k`.

Correctness: **True**
