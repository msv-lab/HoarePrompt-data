The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop depends on the integer value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this integer must be greater than 0. The state of `func` and the test cases are not directly relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is an iterator, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
