To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, and `cases` must be a positive integer. The other variables and structures, such as `n` and `info`, are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`cases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is still an integer in the range 3 to 78 for each test case, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, where each sublist is sorted and contains three elements: two elements are either 1, 26, or 52 (depending on the initial value of `lex`), and the third element is the remaining value of `lex` after the loop has completed its iterations.**
