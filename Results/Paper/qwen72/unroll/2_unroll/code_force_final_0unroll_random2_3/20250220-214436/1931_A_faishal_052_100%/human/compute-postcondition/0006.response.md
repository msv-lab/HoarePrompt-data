Output State: **The `cases` variable remains unchanged, `n` remains an integer in the range 3 to 78 for each test case, and `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists. Each sublist in `info` is sorted and contains three elements: two elements are either 1, 26, or 52 (depending on the initial value of `lex`), and the third element is the remaining value of `lex` after the loop has completed its iterations. Additionally, the loop prints a string for each sublist in `info`, where the string is composed of the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of the elements in the sublist (converted to lowercase letters by adding 96 to each element).**
