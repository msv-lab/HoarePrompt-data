Output State: `cases` is the input integer representing the number of test cases, `n` remains an integer in the range 3 to 78 for each test case, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each of which is a sorted list of three integers. The integers in each sublist are determined by the initial value of `lex` for that test case, and they follow the rules specified in the loop. Specifically, if `lex` is less than 28, the sublist will contain two 1s and the remaining value of `lex` after subtracting 2. If `lex` is between 28 and 51, the sublist will contain one 1 and two 26s, and the remaining value of `lex` after subtracting 52. If `lex` is between 52 and 78, the sublist will contain three 26s, and the remaining value of `lex` after subtracting 52. Each sublist is sorted in ascending order.
