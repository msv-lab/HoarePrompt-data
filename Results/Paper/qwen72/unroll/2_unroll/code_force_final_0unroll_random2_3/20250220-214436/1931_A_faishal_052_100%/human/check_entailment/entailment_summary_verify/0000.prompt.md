You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78). It processes each `n` to generate a sorted list of three integers, where the first two integers are either 1, 26, or 52 based on the initial value of `n`, and the third integer is the remaining value of `n` after the processing. The function then converts these integers to lowercase letters by adding 96 to each and prints the resulting string for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the decoded strings.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the lexicographically smallest word is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the largest possible value for the first two characters is 26 (i.e., 'z'), which is not always the case. For example, consider the input `n = 48`. The correct output should be `auz` because `a` (1) + `u` (21) + `z` (26) = 48, and `auz` is lexicographically smaller than `czz` (which is the output of the given program).

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the issue:
- The program uses a fixed threshold to determine the values of the first two characters, which can lead to incorrect results.
- The correct approach should involve finding the smallest possible values for the first two characters and then determining the third character to ensure the sum equals `n`.

For example, for `n = 48`:
- The smallest possible value for the first character is `a` (1).
- The smallest possible value for the second character is `u` (21).
- The third character should be `z` (26) to make the sum 48.

The given program outputs `czz` (3 + 26 + 26 = 55), which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
