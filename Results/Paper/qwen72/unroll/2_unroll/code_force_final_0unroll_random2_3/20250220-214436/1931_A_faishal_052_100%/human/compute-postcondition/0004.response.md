Output State: `cases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is still an integer in the range 3 to 78 for each test case, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, where each sublist is sorted and contains three elements: two elements are either 1, 26, or 52 (depending on the initial value of `lex`), and the third element is the remaining value of `lex` after the loop has completed its iterations.
