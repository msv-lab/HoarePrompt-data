Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads an integer `t` to determine the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. It then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints the letter that appears most frequently. The logic is sound and matches the requirements of the problem.
