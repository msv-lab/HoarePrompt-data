Reasoning:  
The program correctly follows the problem description and the requirements. It reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then for each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints the character that appears most frequently. The logic is straightforward and correctly implemented. The program handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem:

1. It reads the correct number of test cases.
2. It processes each string of length 5.
3. It correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
4. It prints 'A' if 'A' appears more frequently, and 'B' otherwise.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing one output for each test case based on the frequency of 'A' and 'B'.

Correctness: **True**
