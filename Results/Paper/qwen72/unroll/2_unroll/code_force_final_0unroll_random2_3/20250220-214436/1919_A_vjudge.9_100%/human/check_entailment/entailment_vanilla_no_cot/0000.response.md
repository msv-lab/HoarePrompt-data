Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the given rules and problem description. The logic in the program hinges on the parity of the difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have. Here's why the program works:

1. **Turns and Moves**: The game alternates between Alice and Bob, and each player must either swap wallets or keep their current wallet, followed by removing one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from an empty wallet) loses.

2. **Parity Analysis**:
   - If the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even (i.e., `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`), the game will always end in a draw or a situation where both players have an equal number of moves left. Since the game is symmetric and both players play optimally, the player who starts (Alice) will always lose if the difference is even.
   - If the difference is odd (i.e., `abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`), the game will not be symmetric, and the player who starts (Alice) can always force a win by playing optimally.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - When the difference is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is the one who ends up with an empty wallet first.
   - When the difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even difference, and thus Bob will be forced into a losing position eventually.

Given this analysis, the program correctly outputs "Bob" when the difference is even and "Alice" when the difference is odd, which aligns with the optimal play strategy described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
