### Reasoning:

The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet, with the player who cannot make a valid move losing. The key to solving this problem is to understand the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of coins in the wallets.

1. **Initial State**: Alice and Bob start with `a` and `b` coins, respectively.
2. **Turns**: Each player can either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., cannot remove a coin because their wallet is empty) loses.

### Key Insight:
- If the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, then the game will always end in a state where both wallets have the same number of coins. This is because each move (either swapping or removing a coin) will maintain the parity of the difference.
- If the difference is odd, then the game will end in a state where the wallets have a different number of coins, and the player with more coins will always be able to force a win.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b` in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
- If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
- If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

### Correctness:
- The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`.
- The logic is sound because if the difference is even, the game will always end in a tie (or Bob wins because Alice cannot force a win), and if the difference is odd, Alice can always force a win by making the right moves.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and input constraints.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
