Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The logic of the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes**: It calculates the total number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - For each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is 0, it increments the count of 0s in `cnt` and adds 1 to `ans` if there has been at least one 1 encountered before (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is 1, it increments the count of 1s in `cnt` and adds the number of remaining zeroes to `ans` (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`).

4. **Output**: The program prints the total cost `ans` for each test case.

To verify the correctness, let's analyze the logic:

- **Initial State**: The program correctly initializes the counts and the total cost.
- **Cost Calculation for 0s**: When a 0 is encountered, the program checks if there has been any 1 before it. If so, it adds 1 to the cost because a cyclic shift is needed to move the 1 to the right of the 0.
- **Cost Calculation for 1s**: When a 1 is encountered, the program adds the number of remaining zeroes to the cost. This is because each 1 needs to be moved to the right of all remaining zeroes to achieve a sorted string.

The logic is consistent with the problem description, and the execution summary confirms that the program processes the input as expected and prints the results for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
