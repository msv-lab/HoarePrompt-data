### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input. It then iterates over each test case, calling `func_5()` for each one.

2. **Reading `n` and `k`:**
   - `func_5()` reads two integers `n` and `k` using `func_3()`. `func_3()` returns a map object of integers, which are then unpacked into `n` and `k`.

3. **Finding the Maximum Value `v`:**
   - The program then iterates from `n` down to `1` to find the largest integer `i` such that `i * n` results in `n` when passed to `func_2()`. This is done by making a query `? 1 {i * n}` and checking if the response is `n`. If it is, `v` is set to `i` and the loop breaks. If no such `i` is found, `v` remains `1`.

4. **Checking for Valid Subarrays:**
   - The program then iterates over possible values of `i` from `1` to `n // k`. For each `i`, it tries to find a sequence of subarrays such that `f(l, r) = i * v` for each subarray.
   - It initializes `cnt` to `k` and `l` to `1`. It then makes queries `? l {i * v}` and updates `l` to the response plus one. It decrements `cnt` after each query.
   - If `cnt` reaches `0` and `l` is `n + 1`, it means that the program has successfully found `k` subarrays that satisfy the condition, and it prints `! {i * v}` and returns.

5. **No Valid Subarrays Found:**
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid sequence of subarrays, the program prints `! -1` and returns.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Initial Query Loop:**
  - The loop that finds the maximum value `v` is correct. It correctly identifies the largest `i` such that `i * n` results in `n` when passed to `func_2()`. This is a valid approach to find the maximum value in the array, as `f(l, r)` for the entire array `f(1, n)` would be `n * max(a)`.

- **Subarray Check Loop:**
  - The loop that checks for valid subarrays is also correct. It correctly makes queries to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v` and updates `l` accordingly. If it successfully finds `k` such subarrays, it prints the correct answer.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where no valid subarray sequence is found by printing `! -1`.
  - The program also handles the case where `k = 1` correctly, as it will find the maximum value `v` and then check if `f(1, n) = v * n`.

- **Query Limits:**
  - The program makes at most `2 * n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.

- **Output and Flushing:**
  - The program correctly prints the queries and answers, and flushes the output after each query and answer, ensuring that the interaction with the judge is handled properly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided interaction rules. It correctly handles the input, makes valid queries, and prints the correct answers.

**Correctness: True**
