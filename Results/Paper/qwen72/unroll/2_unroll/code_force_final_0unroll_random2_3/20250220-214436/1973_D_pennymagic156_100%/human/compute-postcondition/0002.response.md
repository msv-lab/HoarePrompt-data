The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the step value `-1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and the loop will start with `i` set to `n`. The loop will decrement `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is 0, at which point the loop will terminate. Given that `n` and `k` are positive integers and `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the initial conditions.

However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` starts at `n`. The variable `v` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is 1, `i` is `n`**
