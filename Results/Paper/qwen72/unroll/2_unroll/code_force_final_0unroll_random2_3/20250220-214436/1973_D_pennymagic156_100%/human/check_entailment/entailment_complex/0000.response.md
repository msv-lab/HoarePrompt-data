Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - `func_5` starts by reading two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `func_3`. This is correct as `func_3` returns a map object of integers, which can be unpacked into `n` and `k`.

2. **Finding the Largest `i` such that `i * n` Results in `n`:**
   - The function iterates over the range `[n, 1]` in reverse order, printing queries of the form `? 1 {i * n}` and checking the response.
   - If the response `v` equals `n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. This is intended to find the largest `i` such that `i * n` is a valid `f(l, r)` value for `l = 1` and `r = n`.
   - If no such `i` is found, `v` remains 1. This part of the function is logically sound and follows the problem's constraints.

3. **Iterating Over Possible Values of `i` to Find the Largest Valid `m`:**
   - The function then iterates over the range `[1, n // k]` to find the largest valid `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`.
   - For each `i` in this range, it performs a series of queries to find the smallest `r` for each `l` such that `f(l, r) = i * v`.
   - It uses a while loop to ensure that the subarrays are valid and counts down `cnt` to ensure that exactly `k` subarrays are found.
   - If `cnt` reaches 0 and `l` equals `n + 1`, it prints the answer `! {i * v}` and returns. This means that a valid `m` has been found.
   - If no valid `m` is found after the loop, it prints `! -1` and returns.

4. **Handling Queries and Responses:**
   - The function uses `func_2` to read the response from the queries, which is correct as `func_2` reads an integer from the standard input.
   - The function correctly flushes the output after each query to ensure that the interaction is handled properly.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `k = 1` correctly by finding the largest `i` such that `i * n` is a valid `f(l, r)` value for the entire array.
   - The function also handles the case where no valid `m` exists by printing `! -1`.

6. **Query Limit:**
   - The function makes at most `2 * n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the input, performs the necessary queries, and prints the correct answer based on the responses.

Correctness: **True**
