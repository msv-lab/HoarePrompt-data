### Reasoning:

1. **Handling `k = 1`**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not handle the case where `k = 1` properly. According to the problem description, when `k = 1`, the value of `m` should always be `f(1, n)`, which is the maximum value in the array `a` multiplied by the length of the array `n`.
   - The program, however, does not directly handle this case. Instead, it tries to find a valid split for `k` subarrays, which is unnecessary and may lead to incorrect results when `k = 1`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value**:
   - The program attempts to find the largest value `v` such that `f(1, r) = v * n` for some `r`. This is done by iterating from `n` down to `1` and querying `f(1, i * n)`.
   - If `v == n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. This means `v` is the largest integer `i` such that `i * n` results in `n` when passed to `func_2()`. However, this does not necessarily find the maximum value in the array `a`.

3. **Splitting the Array**:
   - The program then tries to split the array into `k` subarrays by iterating over possible values of `i` from `1` to `n // k`.
   - For each `i`, it queries `f(l, i * v)` and updates `l` and `cnt` accordingly.
   - If it successfully finds a split where `cnt == 0` and `l == n + 1`, it prints the answer `i * v` and returns.
   - If no such split is found, it prints `-1`.

4. **Robustness**:
   - The program's logic for determining when to output `-1` is not robust. It may miss cases where no valid split is possible, especially when `k > 1`.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the maximum value in the array `a` is not found through the initial queries, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where `k = 1` correctly and does not robustly determine when no valid `m` exists.
- Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
