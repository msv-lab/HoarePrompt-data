You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two non-negative integers x and y as input, where 0 <= x, y <= 99, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons respectively.
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: The values of `x` and `y` are unchanged, and `ap` remains the same.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `ap` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the user, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons respectively. It calculates and prints the minimum number of boxes required to store these icons, where each box can hold 15 1x1 icons or 2 2x2 icons. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input variables `x` and `y`. After the function concludes, the values of `x` and `y` are unchanged, and `ap` remains the same.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons (x) and the number of 2x2 icons (y) are such that the 2x2 icons can be placed first, and then the 1x1 icons can fill the remaining spaces optimally. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of screens required for 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons is incorrect. The program subtracts `bxsfory * 15` from `x` without considering the actual available space after placing the 2x2 icons. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `x = 14` and `y = 1`. The program will calculate `bxsfory = 1` (since one 2x2 icon fits in one screen), and then `x = 14 - 1 * 15 + 1 * 4 = 3`. It will then calculate `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(3 / 15) = 1`, and print `1 + 1 = 2`. However, the correct answer should be 1, as one screen can fit one 2x2 icon and 14 1x1 icons (since one 2x2 icon leaves 11 cells free, and 11 + 14 = 15, which fits in one screen).

This indicates that the program does not correctly account for the available space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
