Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`ap`) and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each.

2. **Logic for 2x2 Icons**: The program calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct because each screen can hold up to 2 of the 2x2 icons, and if there are any remaining icons, they will require an additional screen.

3. **Logic for 1x1 Icons**: The program then calculates the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. It subtracts the space occupied by the 2x2 icons from the total space available on the screens used for 2x2 icons. The remaining space is calculated as `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This is incorrect because it should be `x - bxsfory * 11` (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons is `15 - 4 * (number of 2x2 icons on that screen)`).

4. **Correcting the Logic**: The correct calculation for the remaining space for 1x1 icons should be:
   - Calculate the total space used by 2x2 icons: `y * 4`
   - Calculate the total number of screens required for 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`
   - Calculate the remaining space on these screens: `bxsfory * 15 - y * 4`
   - Add the remaining 1x1 icons to the remaining space: `x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)`
   - Calculate the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: `math.ceil((x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)) / 15)`

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly:
   - If `x == 0` and `y > 0`, it prints the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.
   - If `x > 0` and `y == 0`, it prints the number of screens required for 1x1 icons.
   - If `x == 0` and `y == 0`, it prints `0`.

6. **Final Output**: The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

Given the incorrect logic for calculating the remaining space for 1x1 icons, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
