The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates with two integers, `n` and `k`, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns. 

Functionality: **The function operates with two implied integers, `n` and `k`, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even, but it does not accept any parameters directly. The return value is not specified.**
