Output State: **`r` is a list of integers, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`, `y1` is equal to `r[3] + 1`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, and `y2` is equal to `r[5]`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number. `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y2` is greater than `y1`.**
