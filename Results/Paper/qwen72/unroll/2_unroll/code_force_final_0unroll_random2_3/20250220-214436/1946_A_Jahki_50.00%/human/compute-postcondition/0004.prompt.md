You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is intended to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: The loop will process each test case and print the number of operations required to increment the median value of the array until it is no longer equal to the original median. If `num2` (the length of the array) is greater than 10000, the loop will print 1 and 16668 and then break, stopping further processing of test cases. The variables `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `a`, `b`, `ma`, and `new_median` will be updated within the loop for each test case, but their final values will depend on the specific input for the last test case processed. The variable `num` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the provided `n` and `a`. The total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer, and the sum of the values of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
