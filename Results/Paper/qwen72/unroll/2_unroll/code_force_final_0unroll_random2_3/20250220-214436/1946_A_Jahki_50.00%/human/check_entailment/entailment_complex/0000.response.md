Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `num` and processes each test case within a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `num2` (the length of the array) is greater than 10000, the function prints 1 and 16668 and breaks out of the loop. This is an unusual edge case and seems to be a hardcoded response that does not align with the problem description. The problem does not specify any special handling for arrays longer than 10000, so this part of the code is likely incorrect.

3. **Array Processing**:
   - The array `a` is split and converted to integers, then sorted to form `b`.
   - The median index `ma` is calculated based on whether `num2` is even or odd.
   - The original median is stored in `median`.

4. **Median Increment**:
   - The function enters a loop to increment the element at the median index `ma` until the new median is greater than the original median.
   - Each increment operation is counted in `op`.
   - The array `b` is sorted after each increment to ensure the new median is correctly identified.

5. **Output**:
   - The number of operations required to increase the median is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Hardcoded Edge Case**: The condition `if num2 > 10000` and the subsequent print statements are not aligned with the problem description. The problem does not mention any special handling for arrays longer than 10000, and the values 1 and 16668 do not make sense in the context of the problem.
- **Inefficient Sorting**: Sorting the array `b` after each increment operation is inefficient. The array should be sorted only once, and then the necessary increments can be calculated without repeated sorting.

### Corrected Approach:
- Remove the hardcoded edge case.
- Sort the array `b` once.
- Calculate the number of operations required to increase the median by incrementing the necessary elements and counting the operations.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, particularly the hardcoded edge case and the inefficient sorting, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
