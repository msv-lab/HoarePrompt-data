Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. If `n` is greater than 10000, the function prints 1 and 16668 and stops processing further test cases. Otherwise, it calculates the number of operations required to increment the median value of the array `a` until it is no longer equal to the original median, and prints this number for each test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. The variables used within the function are updated for each test case, but their final values depend on the specific input of the last test case processed. The variable `num` (the total number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
