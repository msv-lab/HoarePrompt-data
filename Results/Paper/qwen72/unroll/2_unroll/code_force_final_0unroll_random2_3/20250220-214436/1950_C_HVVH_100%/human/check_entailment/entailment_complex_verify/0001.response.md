### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `n` times, where it reads a time string in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`.

2. **Time Conversion Logic:**
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'. This is correct because 13:00 to 23:00 in 24-hour format corresponds to 01:00 PM to 11:00 PM in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'. This is correct because 12:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.
   - For all other values of `h` (1 to 11), it sets `day` to 'AM'. This is correct because 01:00 to 11:59 in 24-hour format corresponds to 01:00 AM to 11:59 AM in 12-hour format.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The function prints the time in the format `hh:mm` followed by the `day` (AM or PM). The `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'` ensures that the hours and minutes are always two digits, which is correct according to the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where `h` is 0, 12, and greater than 12.
   - It also correctly handles the transition from AM to PM and vice versa.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code confirms that the function reads the number of test cases and processes each time string correctly.
- The annotations also confirm that the variables `h`, `m`, and `day` are updated appropriately within each iteration of the loop.
- The final state of the program after each iteration is that the time is printed in the correct 12-hour format with the appropriate AM/PM indicator.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and handles all edge cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
