The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set to a value for the loop to execute.

Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes, as it already meets the condition.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is a placeholder variable**
