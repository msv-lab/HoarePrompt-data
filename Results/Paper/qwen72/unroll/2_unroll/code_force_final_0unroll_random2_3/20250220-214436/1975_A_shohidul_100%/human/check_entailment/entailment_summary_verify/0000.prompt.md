You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads input values for `t`, `n`, and `a` from the user. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it checks if the list `a` of `n` integers is either non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by removing the first element. If the list meets either of these conditions, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not retained as they are re-assigned within each iteration of the loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping is flawed. The program only checks the first occurrence of a pair where `a[i - 1] > a[i]` and then tries to split the array at that point. However, it does not consider the possibility that there might be multiple such pairs, and it does not correctly handle the case where the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping at a different point.

### Example of a Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4
5
7 9 2 2 3
3
1 2 3
```

The program will output:
```
No
Yes
Yes
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
No
Yes
Yes
```

The program fails for the first test case. The array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` cannot be made non-decreasing by any number of prefix-suffix swaps. The program incorrectly outputs "No" for this case, but it should output "No" because no valid split and swap can make the array non-decreasing.

### Correct Logic:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
1. Identify the point where the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-decreasing.
2. Check if the last element of the first part is less than or equal to the first element of the second part.
3. If the above conditions are met, then the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the two parts.

The provided program does not implement this logic correctly, leading to incorrect results for some cases.
