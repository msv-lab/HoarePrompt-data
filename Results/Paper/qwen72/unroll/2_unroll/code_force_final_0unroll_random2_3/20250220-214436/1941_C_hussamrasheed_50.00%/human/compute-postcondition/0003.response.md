The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The list `test_cases` contains `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. The integer `n` has the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. The result for each test case is based on the input `n` and `s`, but the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases.**
