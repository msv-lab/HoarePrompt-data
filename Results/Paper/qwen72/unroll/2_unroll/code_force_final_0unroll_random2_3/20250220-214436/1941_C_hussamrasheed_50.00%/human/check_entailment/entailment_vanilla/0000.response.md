Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful.
   - A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - If the string is already beautiful, we should output 0.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of occurrences of the substring "map" in `s` and stores it in `m`.
   - It then replaces all occurrences of "map" in `s` with an empty string.
   - Next, it counts the number of occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` and stores it in `p`.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of `m` and `p`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program only counts and removes occurrences of "map" and "pie" as whole substrings.
   - It does not consider the possibility that removing a single character might prevent the formation of "pie" or "map" substrings.
   - For example, in the string "mmapnapie", removing the 4th character 'n' would make the string "mmapapie", which still contains "map" and "pie". The program would incorrectly output 2, but the correct answer is 1 (by removing the 'm' or 'p' from "map").

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly handle all cases where a single character removal can prevent the formation of "pie" or "map" substrings.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
