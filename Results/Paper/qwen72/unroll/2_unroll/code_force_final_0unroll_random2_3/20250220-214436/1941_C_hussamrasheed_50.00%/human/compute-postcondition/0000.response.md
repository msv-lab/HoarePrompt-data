Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `t` is now an input integer.**
