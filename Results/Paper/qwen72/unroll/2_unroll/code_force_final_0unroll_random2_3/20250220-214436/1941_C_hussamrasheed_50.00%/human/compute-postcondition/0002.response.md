Output State: **The variable `t` remains unchanged. The list `test_cases` is not modified. For each test case, the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s` are counted, and the sum of these counts is printed. The variables `n`, `s`, `m`, and `p` are updated for each iteration of the loop, but their final values after the loop are not retained.**
