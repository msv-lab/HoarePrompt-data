The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and this remains true after the input. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and `x` is a list of integers of length n-1 where 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n.**
