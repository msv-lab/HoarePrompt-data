The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself and will start from 0. The other variables (`n`, `s`, and `results`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
