You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Kirill starts at the end of the queue (position `n+1`).
   - He can bribe people to move to any position `j` where `j < i` (his current position).
   - The cost to move to position `j` is `a_j` plus `b_k` for all `k` such that `j < k < i`.
   - Kirill wants to be among the first `m` people in the queue.
   - We need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to achieve this.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `k`.
     - It reads the `a` and `b` lists, reverses them, and initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.
     - It iterates over the first `n - k` positions (from the end of the queue) to calculate the cost of moving to these positions.
     - If `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, it adds the current `soma_b` and `a[i]` to `pref` and resets `soma_b`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `b[i]` to `soma_b`.
     - After this loop, it initializes `resultado` to infinity and iterates over the remaining positions to find the minimum cost.
     - It updates `resultado` with the minimum cost and adds `b[i]` to `soma_b`.
     - Finally, it prints the minimum cost.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the number of test cases.
     - It iterates over each test case and calls `func_1` for each one.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Reversing the Lists:**
     - Reversing the lists is a crucial step because it allows us to consider the positions from the end of the queue to the front, which is necessary for calculating the minimum cost.
   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - The program correctly calculates the cost of moving to each position by considering the `a` and `b` values.
     - The `soma_b` variable keeps track of the cumulative cost of `b` values for positions that Kirill has not yet moved past.
     - The `pref` variable accumulates the cost of moving to positions where `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`.
   - **Finding the Minimum Cost:**
     - The program correctly finds the minimum cost by iterating over the remaining positions and updating `resultado` with the minimum cost found.
   - **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
     - `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each one.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where `m` is equal to `n` (Kirill is already in the first `m` positions).
   - The program should handle cases where `m` is 1 (Kirill wants to be at the very front of the queue).
   - The program should handle cases where all `a` values are greater than `b` values and vice versa.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the program is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the cost calculation and minimum cost determination are done correctly.

Correctness: **True**
