Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

### Expected Output:
```
14
```

### Actual Output:
The program will output a different value.

### Analysis:
The program reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which is not necessary for solving the problem. The logic used in the program does not correctly account for the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` people. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where Kirill can move to a position `j` that is not immediately adjacent to his current position, and it does not correctly accumulate the costs for all the positions he needs to pay for.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Calculate the cost for Kirill to move to each position `j` where `j < i`.
2. For each position `i`, calculate the minimum cost to move to any position `j` such that `j < i` and then add the cost for all positions `k` such that `j < k < i`.
3. Keep track of the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` people.

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.
