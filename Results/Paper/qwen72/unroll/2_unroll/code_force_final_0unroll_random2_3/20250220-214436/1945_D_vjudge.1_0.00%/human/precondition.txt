The function `moedasMinimas` is expected to take input through standard input and output through standard output, handling multiple test cases. Each test case consists of: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, for each test case, two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively, followed by two lists of `n` integers each, `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), representing the cost to bribe the person at position `j` and the cost to bribe each person between positions `j` and `i` when Kirill moves from position `i` to `j`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
