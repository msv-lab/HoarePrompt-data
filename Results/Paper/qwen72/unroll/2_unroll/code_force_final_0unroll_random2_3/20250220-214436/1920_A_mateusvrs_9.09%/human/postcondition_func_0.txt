The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer. The function processes these constraints to determine the number of valid integers for each test case. A valid integer is one that lies between the maximum of type 1 constraints (`bx`) and the minimum of type 2 constraints (`ax`), excluding any type 3 constraints (`cx`). The function then prints these results, one per test case, each on a new line. The final state of the program is that `r` is a list of integers, each representing the number of valid integers for the corresponding test case, and `r` has a length equal to `t`.
