### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3 (i.e., `k != x`).
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the maximum possible value of `k` (initially).
   - It initializes `bx` to a very small number (`-1`) to represent the minimum possible value of `k` (initially).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a == 1` (i.e., `k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`. This ensures that `bx` is the highest lower bound for `k`.
   - If `a == 2` (i.e., `k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`. This ensures that `ax` is the lowest upper bound for `k`.
   - If `a == 3` (i.e., `k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`. This ensures that all values of `x` that `k` must not be equal to are stored.

4. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If this is true, it means there is no valid `k` that can satisfy both `k >= bx` and `k <= ax`, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx` is less than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy `bx <= k <= ax` and are not in the set `cx`.

5. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - It initializes a variable `tmp` to count the number of values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - It iterates through the set `cx` and increments `tmp` for each value `i` that is within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - It calculates the total number of valid integers as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` and appends this value to the result list `r`.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Type 1 and Type 2 Constraints**:
  - The program correctly updates `bx` and `ax` to reflect the maximum lower bound and the minimum upper bound, respectively. This ensures that the range `[bx, ax]` is the valid range for `k`.

- **Type 3 Constraints**:
  - The program correctly stores the values of `x` for type 3 constraints in the set `cx`. This ensures that all values that `k` must not be equal to are accounted for.
  - The program then correctly counts how many of these values fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, returning `0` as expected.
  - It also correctly handles the case where there are no values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Annotated Code Validation:

- **Initialization of `ax` and `bx`**:
  - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`), which is appropriate for the upper bound.
  - `bx` is initialized to a very small number (`-1`), which is appropriate for the lower bound.

- **Processing Constraints**:
  - The logic for updating `bx` and `ax` is correct and ensures that the final values are the tightest bounds.
  - The logic for adding values to `cx` is correct and ensures that all values to be excluded are stored.

- **Validation and Counting**:
  - The check `if bx >= ax` correctly identifies when there is no valid range for `k`.
  - The counting logic for `tmp` correctly identifies and excludes the values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and input format. It handles all edge cases and correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
