Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through all possible values of `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. However, the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` is incorrect. The formula `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly count the number of pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
3. Check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

The provided program does not perform these steps correctly. Specifically, the formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not account for the gcd condition and the requirement that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Let's break down the correct approach:
- For each `b`, we need to find all `a` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- This can be simplified by noting that if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, then `a` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b) - b`.

However, the provided program does not implement this logic. Instead, it uses a formula that does not match the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
