### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and converts them to integers.

2. **Initial Answer**:
   - The program initializes the answer `ans` to `n`. This is correct because for `b = 1`, the condition \(a + b\) is always a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) (since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of 1).

3. **Loop for Valid Pairs**:
   - The program then iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - For each `b`, it calculates \((n + b) // (b * b)\) and adds this value to `ans`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked in the loop.
   - The expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This expression is a heuristic that does not match the problem's requirement.

5. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition to check is whether \((a + b) \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The program should iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` and count the pairs that satisfy this condition.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The current approach is inefficient and incorrect because it does not correctly handle the condition and may lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The logic used in the loop is flawed and does not count the valid pairs correctly.

Final: **False**
