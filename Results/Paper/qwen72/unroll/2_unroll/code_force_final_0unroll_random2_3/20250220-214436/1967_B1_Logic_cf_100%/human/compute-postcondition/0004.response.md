Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It then calculates a value `ans` based on `n` and `m` using a specific formula and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function leaves `t` unchanged, and the final values of `n` and `m` will be those from the last test case. The function does not return any value. **
