Functionality: ** The function reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it prints a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`. If `n` is 1, it prints `k`. Otherwise, it prints a sequence where the first integer is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, the second integer is the difference between `k` and the first integer, and the remaining `n-2` integers are 0. **
