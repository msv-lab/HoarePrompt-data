Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description implies that it should be called with multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. These integers must satisfy the conditions: 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. Additionally, the sum of h over all test cases should not exceed 10^6.**
