Output State: **The value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `a` remains unchanged. The loop reads `n` lines of input, each containing an integer `m` and a list of `m` integers `arr`. For each line, it checks if the list can be made non-decreasing by changing at most one element. If it can, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
