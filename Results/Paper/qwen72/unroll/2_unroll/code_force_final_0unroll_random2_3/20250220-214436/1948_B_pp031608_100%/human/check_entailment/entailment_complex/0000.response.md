Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by applying the specified operation any number of times. The operation involves splitting an element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits and inserting them back into the array at the same position.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Logic for Checking Non-Decreasing Order**:
   - The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning.
   - If it finds that the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`, it attempts to split `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and checks if the resulting list of digits plus the current element `arr[i]` can be sorted.
   - If the resulting list cannot be sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If it can be sorted, it updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split number.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, it prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Splitting and Insertion**:
  - The program splits `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
  - However, the correct approach should be to split `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and insert them back into the array at the same position, replacing `arr[i - 1]` with the digits.
  - The current implementation does not correctly handle the insertion of digits back into the array.

- **Incorrect Sorting Check**:
  - The program checks if the list of digits plus the current element can be sorted, but this is not the correct check.
  - The correct check should be to see if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting elements as described.

### Correct Approach:
- **Split and Replace**:
  - When an element `arr[i - 1]` is at least 10 and is greater than `arr[i]`, it should be split into its digits and replaced in the array.
  - The array should then be checked if it can be made non-decreasing.

### Example Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                if arr[i - 1] < 10:
                    ans = False
                    break
                nums = [int(digit) for digit in str(arr[i - 1])]
                arr[i - 1:i] = nums  # Replace arr[i - 1] with its digits
                
                # Check if the array can still be made non-decreasing
                for j in range(i, len(arr)):
                    if arr[j] < arr[j - 1]:
                        ans = False
                        break
                if not ans:
                    break
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly implement the logic for splitting and replacing elements, and it does not correctly check if the array can be made non-decreasing. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
