You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads `n` lines of input, where `n` is an integer provided by the user. Each line contains an integer `m` followed by a list of `m` integers. For each list, the function checks if the list can be made non-decreasing by changing at most one element. If it can, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The state of the program remains unchanged with respect to any external variables `t` and `a` that might have been present before the function call.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption**: The program starts with the assumption that the array can be sorted (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Traversal**: The program traverses the array from the last element to the second element (i.e., from index `m-1` to `1`). This is a good approach because if an element is out of order, it needs to be checked against the previous element to see if it can be split to make the array sorted.

4. **Check for Out of Order Elements**: For each element `arr[i]` that is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`, the program attempts to split `arr[i-1]` into its digits and checks if the resulting list of digits (plus the current element `arr[i]`) is sorted.

5. **Split and Check**: The program splits `arr[i-1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to this list. It then checks if this new list is sorted. If it is not sorted, the program sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Update Array**: If the new list is sorted, the program updates `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number. This is a key step because it ensures that the array remains in a state where further operations can be applied.

7. **Output**: After processing all elements in the array, the program prints `YES` if `ans` is still `True`, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correctness of Splitting**: The program correctly splits the number into its digits and checks if the resulting list is sorted. This is a valid approach because if the digits of a number are sorted, then the number can be split into those digits without disrupting the order of the array.

- **Handling Out of Order Elements**: The program correctly handles out of order elements by checking if the split operation can resolve the issue. If the split operation cannot resolve the issue, the program correctly identifies that the array cannot be sorted.

- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as arrays that are already sorted and arrays with elements less than 10.

### Potential Issues:

- **Incorrect Update of `arr[i-1]`**: The program updates `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number. This is not always correct. For example, if `arr[i-1]` is 45 and `arr[i]` is 3, the program will update `arr[i-1]` to 4, which is not the correct way to handle the split. Instead, `arr[i-1]` should be replaced with the digits [4, 5] and `arr[i]` should be inserted in the correct position.

- **Incorrect Split and Insertion**: The program does not correctly handle the insertion of digits. It only checks if the split list is sorted, but it does not actually insert the digits into the array in the correct order.

### Conclusion:

The program has a logical flaw in how it handles the splitting and insertion of digits. Specifically, it does not correctly update the array after a split operation, and it does not ensure that the digits are inserted in the correct position.

### Correctness:
**False**
