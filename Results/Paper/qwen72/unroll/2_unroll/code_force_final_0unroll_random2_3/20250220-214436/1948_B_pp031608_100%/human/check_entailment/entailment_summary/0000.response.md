Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by applying a specific operation any number of times. The operation involves splitting an element that is at least 10 into its individual digits and inserting them back into the array in the same position.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Checking:**
   - The program attempts to split an element and check if the resulting list of digits is sorted. However, this approach is flawed because the operation can be applied multiple times, and the program should consider the possibility of splitting multiple elements to achieve a sorted array.
   - The program only checks the current element and the previous element, and it only splits the previous element if the current element is smaller. This is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing after multiple operations.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Operations:**
   - The program does not simulate the process of applying the operation multiple times. Instead, it makes a decision based on a single comparison and a single split, which is not enough to solve the problem as described.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be sorted or where the array contains elements that are less than 10 but still need to be considered in the sorting process.

### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the process of splitting elements and checking if the array can be made non-decreasing. This involves:
  - Iterating through the array and splitting any element that is at least 10 into its digits.
  - After splitting, you need to check if the resulting array is non-decreasing.
  - If the array can be made non-decreasing after any number of operations, print 'YES'; otherwise, print 'NO'.

### Example of Correct Logic:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        # Function to split an element into its digits
        def split_into_digits(num):
            return [int(d) for d in str(num)]
        
        # Apply the operation to all elements that are at least 10
        new_arr = []
        for num in arr:
            if num >= 10:
                new_arr.extend(split_into_digits(num))
            else:
                new_arr.append(num)
        
        # Check if the resulting array is non-decreasing
        if new_arr == sorted(new_arr):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing after applying the operation any number of times. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
