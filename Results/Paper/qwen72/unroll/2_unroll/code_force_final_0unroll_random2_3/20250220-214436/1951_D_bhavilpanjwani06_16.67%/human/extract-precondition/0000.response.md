It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take parameters to handle the inputs `n` and `k`, and possibly the number of test cases `t`. Let's correct the function definition and then extract the precondition.

Function definition:
```python
def can_buy_jewels(t, cases):
```
Where `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.

Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).**
