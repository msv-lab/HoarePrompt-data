Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Feasibility (`n < k`)**:
   - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it's impossible for her to buy `k` jewels. The program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

2. **Exact Match (`n == k`)**:
   - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up a single stall with the price of 1 coin per jewel. The program correctly prints 'YES', followed by `1` and the value of `n`.

3. **Greedy Buying Strategy (`n > k` and `k - 1 < n - k + 1`)**:
   - If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, the program prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls:
     - The first stall has a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel.
     - The second stall has a price of `1` coin per jewel.
   - This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels:
     - She buys `1` jewel from the first stall, spending `n - k + 1` coins.
     - She buys `k - 1` jewels from the second stall, spending `k - 1` coins.
     - The total number of coins spent is `(n - k + 1) + (k - 1) = n`, which is exactly the number of coins she has.
     - The total number of jewels bought is `1 + (k - 1) = k`.

4. **Infeasibility (`n > k` and `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`)**:
   - If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, the program prints 'NO'.
   - This condition is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of setting up more than two stalls to achieve the desired result. For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the program should be able to set up stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly 3 jewels, but it incorrectly prints 'NO'.

5. **General Case**:
   - The program does not handle the general case where `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`. In such cases, Bob can still set up multiple stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, Bob can set up `k` stalls, each with a price of 1 coin per jewel, and Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the general case where `n > k` and `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`.

Correctness: **False**
