The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the user input. It then checks the relationship between `n` and `k` and prints one of the following outputs based on the conditions:
- If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', followed by `1` and the value of `n`.
- If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, it prints 'YES', followed by `2`, and then the values `n - k + 1` and `1`.
- If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, it prints 'NO'. 

The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console.
