Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
   - `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).
   - `n` and `k` are the input integers.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - The current value of `k` is such that `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(n - k + 1, 1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `n - k + 1` is a formula derived from the given integers `n` and `k`.
   - `1` is a constant integer.

4. **Understanding the Formula:**
   - Given the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, we can simplify this to:
     \[
     k - 1 < n - k + 1
     \]
     \[
     k - 1 < n - k + 1
     \]
     \[
     k - 1 < n - k + 1
     \]
     \[
     2k - 2 < n
     \]
     \[
     2k < n + 2
     \]
     \[
     k < \frac{n + 2}{2}
     \]
   - This condition ensures that `k` is less than half of `n + 2`.

5. **Output:**
   - The first value printed is `n - k + 1`.
   - The second value printed is `1`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement will output the value of `n - k + 1` and `1`.

Output: **n - k + 1, 1 (where n and k are positive integers such that n is greater than or equal to k, n is not equal to k, and k - 1 is less than n - k + 1)**
