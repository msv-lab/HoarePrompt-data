### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case using a for loop. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `k` for each test case. This is correct as per the problem statement.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - **Case 1: `n < k`**
     - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. The program correctly prints 'NO'.
   - **Case 2: `n == k`**
     - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at `n` coins per jewel. The program correctly prints 'YES', followed by `1` and `n`.
   - **Case 3: `n > k` and `k - 1 < n - k + 1`**
     - If Alice has more coins than `k` and the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` holds, it means that Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels from a stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins per jewel and then buy 1 more jewel from a stall priced at 1 coin. This ensures she buys exactly `k` jewels. The program correctly prints 'YES', followed by `2`, and then `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - **Case 4: `n > k` and `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`**
     - If Alice has more coins than `k` but the condition `k - 1 >= n - k + 1` holds, it means that it is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The program correctly prints 'NO'.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program follows the output format specified in the problem statement:
     - For each test case, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.
     - If it prints 'YES', it also prints the number of stalls and the prices for those stalls.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement and follows the required output format. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
