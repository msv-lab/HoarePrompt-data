Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them, calling `func_1()` for each test case. This is a standard and correct way to handle multiple test cases in Python.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the values of `n` (number of coins Alice has) and `k` (number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy). This is done correctly using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if `n < k`. If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels, so the program prints "NO". This check is correct.

4. **Exact Match Check**: If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with the price `n`. This ensures that Alice buys exactly one jewel and spends all her coins, which is correct.

5. **Greedy Strategy Check**: The program then checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. This condition is intended to determine if Alice can buy `k-1` jewels at a higher price and then buy the last jewel at a lower price. However, this condition is not the correct way to determine if it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The correct approach is to consider if Alice can buy `k` jewels in a way that does not exceed her total coins `n`.

6. **Correct Approach**: To ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, Bob can set up `k` stalls, each with a price of `1` coin. This way, Alice will buy one jewel from each stall until she has bought exactly `k` jewels. This approach is always possible as long as `n >= k`.

7. **Final Check**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NO". This is the fallback case where it is determined that it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. However, this fallback is unnecessary because the correct approach (setting up `k` stalls each with a price of `1` coin) always works if `n >= k`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not consider the correct approach for setting up the stalls. The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is not a valid check for the problem, and the program should always print "YES" and set up `k` stalls each with a price of `1` coin if `n >= k`.

Final: **False**
