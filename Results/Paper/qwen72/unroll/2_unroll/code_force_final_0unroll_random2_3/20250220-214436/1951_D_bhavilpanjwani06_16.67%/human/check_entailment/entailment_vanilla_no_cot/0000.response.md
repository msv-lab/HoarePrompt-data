Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of `n == k` Case**: The program correctly handles the case where `n == k` by setting up one stall with the price equal to `n`. This is correct because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels (which is `n` in this case) at the first stall.

2. **Handling of `n < k` Case**: The program correctly identifies that if `n < k`, it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels, so it prints "NO".

3. **Handling of General Case**: The program attempts to handle the general case where `n > k` and `n != k` by setting up two stalls. However, the logic used to determine the prices of these stalls is flawed. Specifically, the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is not a valid criterion for determining whether Bob can set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels.

   - The program sets the first stall price to `n - k + 1` and the second stall price to `1`. This means Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels at the first stall and 1 jewel at the second stall, which totals `k` jewels. However, this approach fails in many cases where `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`.

4. **General Solution**: A correct approach would be to set up `k` stalls, each with a price of `1` coin. This ensures that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, as she will buy one jewel from each stall until she has bought `k` jewels or runs out of coins. This is always possible as long as `n >= k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        print(' '.join(str(1) for _ in range(k)))
```

This corrected program will always print "YES" if `n >= k` and will set up `k` stalls, each with a price of `1` coin, ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
