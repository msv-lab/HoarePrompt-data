Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case correctly where `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is much larger than `k`, but it should still be possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The current logic in the program only considers two specific cases: when `n == k` and when `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. However, it does not consider the general case where `k` can be achieved by setting up more than 2 stalls with appropriate prices.

For example, consider the input:
```
1000 10
```
Here, Alice has 1000 coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly 10 jewels. The program will output:
```
NO
```
However, it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly 10 jewels. One possible solution is to set up 10 stalls with prices 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10. In this setup, Alice will buy 1 jewel from each stall, spending 100 coins in total, and will have 900 coins left, which is more than enough to buy the required 10 jewels.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle this case.
