Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), `n` and `k` are the input integers, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, the current tuple satisfies this condition. Otherwise, if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, the current value of `k` satisfies this condition. If `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, the current value of `k` does not satisfy the condition.***
