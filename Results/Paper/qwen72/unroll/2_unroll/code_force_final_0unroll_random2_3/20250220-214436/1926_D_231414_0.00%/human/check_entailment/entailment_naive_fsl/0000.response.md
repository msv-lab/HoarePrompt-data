Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the program does not ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits for any of the 31 least significant bits. 

Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

Explanation of the counterexample:
- The numbers 1, 2, and 3 in binary are `000...0001`, `000...0010`, and `000...0011` respectively.
- The numbers 1 and 3 have the same last bit (1st bit), so they cannot be in the same group.
- Therefore, the minimum number of groups required is 2, but the program outputs 1, which is incorrect.
