The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `times`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The other variables and conditions provided in the state before the loop starts do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a list of lists where each inner list contains `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) non-negative integers `a_1, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647**
