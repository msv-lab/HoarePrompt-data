The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `cases` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31), and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is determined based on the list of integers provided in that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `cases` where each inner list contains non-negative integers. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the provided lists of integers.**
