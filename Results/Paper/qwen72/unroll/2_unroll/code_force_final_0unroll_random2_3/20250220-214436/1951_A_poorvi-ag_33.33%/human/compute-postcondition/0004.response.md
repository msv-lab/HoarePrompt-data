The only objects in the loop head are the variable `r` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `results` must contain at least one 'yes' or 'no' for the loop to execute, and `r` will be the first element of `results`.

State: **`start` and `end` remain unchanged, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list containing at least one 'yes' or 'no', `r` is the first element of `results`**
