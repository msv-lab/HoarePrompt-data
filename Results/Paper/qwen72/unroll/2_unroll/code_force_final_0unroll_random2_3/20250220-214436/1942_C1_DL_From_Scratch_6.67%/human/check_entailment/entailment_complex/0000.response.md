### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0 and not used).
   - It then reads a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The function sorts the list of chosen vertices, which is necessary to determine the gaps between consecutive vertices.

3. **Counting Gaps of Size 1**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted list and counts the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices. This is done by checking if `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1 == 1` and incrementing `count` if true.

4. **Handling the Last Vertex**:
   - The function also checks if the gap between the last vertex and the first vertex (considering the polygon is cyclic) is of size 1. This is done by checking if `n - list0[-1] == 1` and incrementing `count` if true.

5. **Calculating the Result**:
   - The function prints `count + x - 2` as the result for each test case. This is based on the idea that for `x` chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2` (since each triangle requires 3 vertices, and the remaining vertices can form additional triangles if there are gaps of size 1).

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic of counting gaps of size 1 and adding `x - 2` is correct because:
  - Each gap of size 1 between two chosen vertices can form a triangle with the next chosen vertex.
  - The `x - 2` term accounts for the fact that any set of `x` vertices can form `x - 2` non-intersecting triangles by connecting the vertices in a cyclic manner.

### Edge Cases:
- The function handles the edge cases correctly:
  - When `x = 2`, the function will print `0` because no triangles can be formed with only 2 vertices.
  - When `x = 3`, the function will print `1` because a single triangle can be formed with 3 vertices.
  - When `x > 3`, the function correctly counts the additional triangles formed by gaps of size 1.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, and the calculation of the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake is accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**
