Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. Here's why:

1. **Handling of the Last and First Vertices:**
   - The program calculates the number of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and adds to the count if the gap is 1. However, it does not correctly handle the gap between the last and the first vertex in the circular arrangement of the polygon.
   - The line `num = n - list0[-1]` only considers the gap from the last vertex to the end of the list, but it should consider the gap from the last vertex to the first vertex in a circular manner. This is done by calculating `num = (list0[0] - list0[-1] - 1) % n`.

2. **Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The program adds `x - 2` to the count of triangles, which is incorrect. The number of triangles formed by non-intersecting diagonals in a polygon with `x` chosen vertices is not simply `x - 2`.
   - The correct formula to calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles formed by `x` vertices in a polygon is `x - 2` if the vertices are chosen such that they form a convex shape. However, the program does not ensure that the vertices form a convex shape, and it does not correctly handle the gaps between vertices.

### Corrected Program:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that we handle the circular nature of the polygon and correctly count the number of non-intersecting triangles. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        
        # Add the first vertex at the end to handle the circular nature
        list0.append(list0[0] + n)
        
        count = 0
        for i in range(x):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        
        # The number of non-intersecting triangles is x - 2 + count
        print(count + x - 2)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Handling the Circular Nature:**
   - We append `list0[0] + n` to the end of the sorted list to handle the circular nature of the polygon. This ensures that the gap between the last and the first vertex is correctly calculated.
   
2. **Counting Gaps:**
   - We iterate through the list and count the gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices.
   
3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The number of non-intersecting triangles is `x - 2` plus the number of gaps of size 1. This is because each gap of size 1 can form an additional triangle with the two chosen vertices.

This corrected program should now handle all test cases correctly.
