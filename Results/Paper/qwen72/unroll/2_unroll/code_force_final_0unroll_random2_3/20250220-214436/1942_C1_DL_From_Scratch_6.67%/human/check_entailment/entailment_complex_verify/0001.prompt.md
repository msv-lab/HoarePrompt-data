You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer and y = 0, and the list of x integers are distinct and within the range 1 to n.

    #State: T is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 10^4, n, x, y, and list0 remain unchanged for each iteration, but their values are re-assigned in each iteration of the loop. count is 0 at the start of each iteration and is printed as count + x - 2 at the end of each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0 and not used), and a list of `x` distinct integers. The function then calculates and prints the number of gaps of size 1 between the sorted list of integers, plus `x - 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of integers remain unchanged, but their values are re-assigned in each iteration of the loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - In this version, `y = 0`, meaning we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - To form a triangle, we need three vertices.
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are given in a list, and we need to sort them to understand their relative positions on the polygon.
   - The number of triangles that can be formed is determined by the gaps between the chosen vertices and the vertices at the ends of the polygon.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
     - It then reads the list of `x` chosen vertices and sorts them.
   - **Counting Triangles:**
     - The program iterates through the sorted list of vertices to count the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices.
     - It also checks the gap between the last vertex and the first vertex (considering the polygon is cyclic).
   - **Final Calculation:**
     - The program adds `x - 2` to the count of gaps of size 1.
     - The reason for adding `x - 2` is that for `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`.

4. **Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 0`
     - Chosen vertices: `1, 6, 2, 5`
     - Sorted: `1, 2, 5, 6`
     - Gaps of size 1: `2 - 1 = 1`, `6 - 5 = 1`
     - Total gaps: `2`
     - Triangles: `2 + 4 - 2 = 4`
     - **Expected Output:** `2` (since the program only counts gaps of size 1 and adds `x - 2`)

   - **Test Case 2:**
     - `n = 8`, `x = 8`, `y = 0`
     - Chosen vertices: `1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8`
     - Sorted: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8`
     - Gaps of size 1: `2 - 1 = 1`, `3 - 2 = 1`, `4 - 3 = 1`, `5 - 4 = 1`, `6 - 5 = 1`, `7 - 6 = 1`, `8 - 7 = 1`
     - Total gaps: `7`
     - Triangles: `7 + 8 - 2 = 13`
     - **Expected Output:** `6` (since the program only counts gaps of size 1 and adds `x - 2`)

   - **Test Case 3:**
     - `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 0`
     - Chosen vertices: `1, 3`
     - Sorted: `1, 3`
     - Gaps of size 1: `3 - 1 = 2` (not counted as it is not 1)
     - Total gaps: `0`
     - Triangles: `0 + 2 - 2 = 0`
     - **Expected Output:** `2` (since the program only counts gaps of size 1 and adds `x - 2`)

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly counts the gaps of size 1 between consecutive chosen vertices and adds `x - 2` to get the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the cyclic nature of the polygon, specifically the gap between the last and first vertices.

### Correctness:
- The program is **not** correct because it does not handle the cyclic nature of the polygon correctly. Specifically, it should consider the gap between the last vertex and the first vertex in the sorted list, which is not done in the current implementation.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = (list0[0] - list0[-1] - 1) % n
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)
```

### Correctness:
- After correcting the program to handle the cyclic nature of the polygon, the program should now be correct.

Correctness: **False** (initial program)
Correctness: **True** (corrected program)
