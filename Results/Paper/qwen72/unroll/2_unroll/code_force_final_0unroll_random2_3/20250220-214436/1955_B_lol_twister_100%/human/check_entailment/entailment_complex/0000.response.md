Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Minimum Value Calculation**: The program correctly identifies the minimum value `a` in the list `l`. This is essential because the progressive square is constructed starting from this minimum value.

3. **Progressive Square Generation**: The program generates the elements of the progressive square by iterating over the indices `k` and `h` (both ranging from 0 to `n-1`) and calculates each element as `a + k * c + d * h`. This matches the rule for constructing the progressive square.

4. **Sorting and Comparison**: Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted before comparison. This is necessary because the elements in the input list `l` are given in random order, and the generated list `li` is constructed in a specific order. Sorting ensures that the comparison is valid.

5. **Output**: The program correctly returns "yes" if the sorted lists `l` and `li` are equal, and "no" otherwise. This aligns with the problem statement, which requires verifying if the input list can form the progressive square.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where the input list `l` might contain duplicate values or values that do not fit the progressive square pattern. The sorting and comparison steps ensure that these cases are correctly handled.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
