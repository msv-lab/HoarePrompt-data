You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. It returns 'yes' if the sorted list `l` matches a newly generated and sorted list `li`, where each element in `li` is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `0 <= k, h < n`, with `a` being the minimum value in the original list `l`. Otherwise, it returns 'no'. The function does not modify the input parameters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d` and the list `l` of `n * n` integers.

2. **Finding the Minimum Element**:
   - The program finds the minimum element `a` in the list `l`. This is a valid approach because the minimum element in the list should correspond to `a_{1,1}` in the progressive square.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square**:
   - The program generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - This formula correctly represents the elements of the progressive square based on the given rules.

4. **Sorting and Comparing**:
   - Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted.
   - The program then checks if the sorted lists are equal. If they are, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.
   - This is a valid approach because the elements of the progressive square should match the elements in the input list, regardless of their initial order.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, which is either 'yes' or 'no'.

### Analysis of the Example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `3 2 3` and `3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8`
  - Minimum element `a` is `1`.
  - Generated list: `[1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11]`
  - Sorted input list: `[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
  - The lists are not equal, so the output is `NO`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `3 2 3` and `3 9 6 5 7 1 11 4 8`
  - Minimum element `a` is `1`.
  - Generated list: `[1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11]`
  - Sorted input list: `[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11]`
  - The lists are equal, so the output is `YES`.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `2 100 100` and `400 300 400 500`
  - Minimum element `a` is `300`.
  - Generated list: `[300, 400, 400, 500]`
  - Sorted input list: `[300, 400, 400, 500]`
  - The lists are equal, so the output is `YES`.

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `3 2 3` and `3 9 6 6 5 1 11 4 8`
  - Minimum element `a` is `1`.
  - Generated list: `[1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11]`
  - Sorted input list: `[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 11]`
  - The lists are not equal (due to the duplicate `6`), so the output is `NO`.

- **Test Case 5**:
  - Input: `4 4 4` and `15 27 7 19 23 23 11 15 7 3 19 23 11 15 11 15`
  - Minimum element `a` is `3`.
  - Generated list: `[3, 7, 11, 15, 7, 11, 15, 19, 11, 15, 19, 23, 15, 19, 23, 27]`
  - Sorted input list: `[3, 7, 7, 11, 11, 11, 15, 15, 15, 15, 19, 19, 23, 23, 23, 27]`
  - The lists are not equal (due to the duplicate `15` and `23`), so the output is `NO`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given array can form a progressive square for the given `n`, `c`, and `d`. The reasoning and steps are sound, and the program produces the correct output for the provided test cases.
