Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers in ascending order, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for 0 <= k, h < n, and the list `l` is equal to the list `li`.**
