The list `l` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `a`, and `li` remain unchanged. The sorted list `l` will now have its elements in ascending order, but the specific values of these elements are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot specify the exact values after sorting.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers in ascending order, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for 0 <= k, h < n.**
