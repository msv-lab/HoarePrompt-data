The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the user, which specifies the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user. The function then checks the string `s` for the presence of the character '1' and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the following conditions: if the count of '1' is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'; if the count of '1' is greater than 2 and odd, or exactly 1, it prints 'NO'; if the substring '11' is present in `s`, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not modify the values of `start`, `end`, or the current working directory. After executing `t` test cases, the function completes and the program state remains unchanged except for the printed outputs.
