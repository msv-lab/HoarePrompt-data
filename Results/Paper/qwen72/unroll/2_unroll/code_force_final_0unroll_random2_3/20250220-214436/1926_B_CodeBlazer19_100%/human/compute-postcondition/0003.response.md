The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings. The integer `n` represents the size of the grid, and each string in the list contains `n` characters, which are either '0' or '1'. The grid is guaranteed to contain exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape's size is greater than 1.

The function returns:
- Case_1: If the grid contains a triangle, the function returns "triangle".
- Case_2: If the grid contains a square, the function returns "square".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'). It returns "triangle" if the grid contains a triangle, and "square" if the grid contains a square.**
