### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case. It then reads `n` lines of input for each test case, which is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The program uses a variable `a` to detect if a row contains exactly one '1'. If such a row is found, it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - The program uses a variable `b` to detect if a row contains more than one '1'. If such a row is found, it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all rows of the grid, the program checks if `a` is not zero. If `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE', it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

4. **Flaws in the Program**:
   - **Triangle Detection**: The program only checks if any row contains exactly one '1'. This is insufficient to determine if the shape is a triangle. According to the problem description, a triangle is defined by rows containing an odd number of '1's in a specific pattern (1, 3, 5, ... or 5, 3, 1, ...). The program does not verify this pattern.
   - **Square Detection**: The program checks if any row contains more than one '1' and sets `b` to 'SQUARE'. This is also insufficient because a square is defined by rows containing the same number of '1's, and they must be aligned. The program does not verify this alignment or the uniformity of the number of '1's across rows.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify a triangle, the program should check if the number of '1's in each row forms a sequence of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ... or 5, 3, 1, ...).
   - To correctly identify a square, the program should check if each row has the same number of '1's and they are aligned.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly identify the shape based on the problem description. It fails to verify the specific patterns required for a triangle and a square. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
