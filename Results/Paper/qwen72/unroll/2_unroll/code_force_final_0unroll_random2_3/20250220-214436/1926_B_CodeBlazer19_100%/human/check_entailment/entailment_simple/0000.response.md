Reasoning:

The program attempts to determine if the shape drawn on the grid is a triangle or a square by counting the number of '1's in each row. However, the logic used to make this determination is flawed:

1. **Triangle Detection**:
   - The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' (`if s.count('1') == 1:`). If this condition is met, it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - This logic is incorrect because a triangle can have rows with more than one '1'. For example, a triangle with `k=3` will have rows with 1, 3, and 5 '1's respectively.

2. **Square Detection**:
   - The program checks if a row contains more than one '1' (`elif s.count('1') > 1:`). If this condition is met, it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.
   - This logic is also incorrect because a triangle can have rows with more than one '1', and a square will always have rows with the same number of '1's.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - The program prints 'TRIANGLE' if `a` is not zero (`if a != 0:`). This means that if any row has exactly one '1', the program will print 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If no row has exactly one '1', the program will print 'SQUARE' (`else: print(b)`).
   - This logic is flawed because it does not correctly identify the shape based on the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the grid is entirely '0's, which is not a valid input according to the problem description.
   - The program does not check the central alignment of '1's in a triangle or the equal distance from the left edge in a square.

Given these issues, the program will not correctly identify the shape in many cases, such as when a triangle has more than one '1' in a row or when a square has rows with more than one '1'.

Correctness: **False**
