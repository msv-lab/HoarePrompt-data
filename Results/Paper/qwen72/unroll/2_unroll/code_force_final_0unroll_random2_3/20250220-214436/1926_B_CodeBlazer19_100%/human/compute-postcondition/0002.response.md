Output State: **The loop will print 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' for each test case based on the shape found in the grid. The variable `a` will be set to 'TRIANGLE' if a triangle is found, and `b` will be set to 'SQUARE' if a square is found. After all iterations, the values of `t` and `n` will remain unchanged, and `a` and `b` will be reset for each test case.**
