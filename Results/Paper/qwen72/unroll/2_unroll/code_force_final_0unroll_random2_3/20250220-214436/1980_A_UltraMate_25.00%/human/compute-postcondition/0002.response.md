Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n and m are integers for each test case such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, a is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. The loop has printed the number of characters from 'A' to 'F' that are either missing or have a count less than m for each test case.**
