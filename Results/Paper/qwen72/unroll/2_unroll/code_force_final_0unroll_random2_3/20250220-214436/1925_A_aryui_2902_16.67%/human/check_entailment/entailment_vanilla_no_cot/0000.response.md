Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` generates a string by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of the generated string `s`.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The program will generate the string `ababab`, but this string does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 alphabets (`a`, `b`, and `c`). Specifically, it does not contain the subsequences `ac`, `ca`, `cb`, or `cc`.

A correct approach would need to generate a string that ensures all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are present. One such approach is to generate a string that includes all possible combinations of the first `k` alphabets in a way that ensures all subsequences of length `n` are covered. This can be achieved by constructing a de Bruijn sequence or using a more straightforward combinatorial approach.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import itertools

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = de_bruijn(k, n)
    print(s)

def de_bruijn(k, n):
    """Generate a de Bruijn sequence for alphabet size k and subsequence length n."""
    a = [0] * k * n
    sequence = []
    
    def db(t, p):
        if t > n:
            if n % p == 0:
                for j in range(1, p + 1):
                    sequence.append(a[j])
        else:
            a[t] = a[t - p]
            db(t + 1, p)
            for j in range(a[t - p] + 1, k):
                a[t] = j
                db(t + 1, t)
    
    db(1, 1)
    return ''.join(chr(97 + x) for x in sequence)

# Alternatively, a simpler combinatorial approach:
def combinatorial(k, n):
    """Generate a string that contains all subsequences of length n using the first k alphabets."""
    alphabet = ''.join(chr(97 + i) for i in range(k))
    subsequences = [''.join(p) for p in itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
    return ''.join(subsequences)

# You can use either de_bruijn or combinatorial in the main loop
```

This version uses a de Bruijn sequence to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are included in the generated string `s`. Alternatively, a simpler combinatorial approach is also provided, which generates all possible subsequences and concatenates them into a single string. Both approaches should work correctly for the given problem.
