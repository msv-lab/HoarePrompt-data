Reasoning:  
The program provided is intended to solve the problem of generating a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. However, the approach used in the program is incorrect.

The function `func_1` generates a string by repeating the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the function will return `'abcabc'`, but the string `'cc'` (which is a valid string of length 2 using the first 3 alphabets) is not a subsequence of `'abcabc'`.

The correct approach would be to generate a string that ensures all possible combinations of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences. One way to achieve this is to concatenate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets, but this can be very long. A more efficient approach is to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence that contains every possible subsequence of a given length.

Given the constraints, the program should generate a string that is at least `k^n` characters long to ensure all possible subsequences are included. However, the current program does not meet this requirement.

Correctness: **False**
