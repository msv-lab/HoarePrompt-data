Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It processes the list `a` based on the directions given in the string `s` to create a new list `b` with the same elements as `a` but in a potentially different order. The function then calculates the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns these cumulative products in the original order of the elements in `b`. The final state of the program includes the returned list `ans` which contains these cumulative products. **
