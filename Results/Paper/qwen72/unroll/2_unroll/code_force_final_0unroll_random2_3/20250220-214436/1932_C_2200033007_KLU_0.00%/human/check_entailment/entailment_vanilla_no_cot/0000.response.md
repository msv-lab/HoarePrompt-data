Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in how the product of the remaining elements is calculated and updated after each command.

1. **Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product of the elements that are removed, but it should calculate the product of the elements that remain in the array after each command.

2. **Modulo Operation**: The program does not take the modulo `m` of the product at each step, which is required by the problem statement.

3. **Order of Operations**: The program appends the removed elements to the list `b` and then calculates the product in reverse order, which is incorrect. The product should be calculated and the modulo taken at each step of the command processing.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
- Calculate the initial product of all elements in the array `a`.
- For each command, output the current product modulo `m`.
- Update the product by dividing it by the element that is removed (and taking the modulo `m` to handle large numbers).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    from math import prod
    
    # Calculate the initial product of all elements
    product = prod(a) % m
    b = []
    
    # Initialize left and right pointers
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    
    for i in range(n):
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], -1, m)) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], -1, m)) % m
            r -= 1
    
    return b

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Product**: The initial product of all elements is calculated using `prod(a) % m`.
- **Modular Inverse**: To remove an element from the product, we use the modular inverse of the element. This is done using `pow(a[l], -1, m)` or `pow(a[r], -1, m)`, which computes the modular inverse of `a[l]` or `a[r]` under modulo `m`.
- **Updating the Product**: After each command, the product is updated by multiplying it with the modular inverse of the removed element and taking the modulo `m` again.

This approach ensures that the product is correctly updated and the modulo operation is applied at each step, as required by the problem statement.
