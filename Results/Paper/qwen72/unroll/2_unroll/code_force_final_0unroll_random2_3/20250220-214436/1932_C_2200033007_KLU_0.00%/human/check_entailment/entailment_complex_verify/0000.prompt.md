You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

    0 0 0 4 4 4

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.

    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `b` is a list of n integers where the integers are the same as in `a` but possibly in a different order, `l` is n, `r` is -1, `ans` is a list of the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, `p` is the product of all elements in `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in their original order. `ans` was initially calculated in reverse order, so reversing it again returns the cumulative products in the original order of the elements in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It processes the list `a` based on the directions given in the string `s` to create a new list `b` with the same elements as `a` but in a potentially different order. The function then calculates the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns these cumulative products in the original order of the elements in `b`. The final state of the program includes the returned list `ans` which contains these cumulative products.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly compute the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` at each step before removing an element. Instead, it appends the elements to be removed to a list `b` and then computes the product in reverse order, which does not match the problem description.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

The expected output should be:
```
0 2 4 1
```

However, the program will produce:
```
24 24 24 24
```

This is because the program does not compute the product of the remaining elements at each step before removing an element. Instead, it multiplies the elements to be removed in reverse order, which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to compute the product of the remaining elements at each step and then take the remainder with `m`.
