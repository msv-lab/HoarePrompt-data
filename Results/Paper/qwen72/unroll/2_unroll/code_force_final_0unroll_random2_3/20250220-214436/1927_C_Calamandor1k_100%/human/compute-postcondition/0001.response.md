To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the elements of the `cases` list. The loop will execute if `cases` is not empty and contains at least one tuple. The tuple should have the correct structure: it must contain three integers (n, m, k) and two lists (a, b) with the specified properties.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements (n, m, k) and two lists (a, b).
- `results` is an empty list.

We need to ensure that `cases` has at least one tuple for the loop to execute. The tuple should be structured as follows:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5.
- `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m).
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers of lengths n and m, respectively, with elements in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `cases` must contain at least one tuple.
- The first tuple in `cases` should have the correct structure and values as described above.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, the first tuple in `cases` is (n, m, k, a, b) where `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and `a` and `b` are lists of integers of lengths n and m, respectively, with elements in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6, `results` is an empty list**
