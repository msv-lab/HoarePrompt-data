### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves a circle of coins, each either facing up ("U") or down ("D").
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., no facing-up coins left) loses.
   - The goal is to determine if Alice (the first player) will win if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The game state is determined by the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have a move when it's her turn, and she can force Bob into a position where he has no moves left.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice will eventually be the one with no moves left.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it counts the number of facing-up coins (`num_up`).
   - It then checks if `num_up` is odd or even.
   - If `num_up` is odd, the program returns "YES" (Alice wins).
   - If `num_up` is even, the program returns "NO" (Bob wins).

4. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and splits it into a list.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the number of coins and the string representing the coin states.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `s` for each test case.

5. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`.
   - It returns "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if the count is even.
   - This logic aligns with the key observation that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the number of facing-up coins. The reasoning and the implementation are consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
