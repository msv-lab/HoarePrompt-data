### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The problem states that the tree has exactly two leaves, which means it can be represented as an array. The program uses a `deque` to represent this array-like tree.
   - The `deque` is initialized as empty, and the first edge is added to it. Subsequent edges are added to the appropriate end of the `deque` based on their connection to the existing nodes.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
   - It then reads `n-1` edges and constructs the tree.
   - Finally, it reads the starting node for the round.

3. **Tree Construction**:
   - The tree is constructed by adding nodes to the `deque` based on their connections. This ensures that the tree is represented linearly, which is appropriate given the problem constraints.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the tree is initially empty and adds the first edge.

4. **Game Logic**:
   - The game logic is based on the number of moves each player can make. The player who can make an odd number of moves will win, and the player who can make an even number of moves will lose.
   - The program calculates the number of moves from the starting node to the leaves by finding the minimum distance to the start of the `deque` (`idx`) and the end of the `deque` (`n - idx - 1`).
   - It then checks if either of these distances is odd. If at least one distance is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Ron" if any of the distances is odd, and "Hermione" if both distances are even.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly constructs the tree as a linear structure using a `deque`.
- The logic for determining the winner based on the number of moves is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints.
- The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
