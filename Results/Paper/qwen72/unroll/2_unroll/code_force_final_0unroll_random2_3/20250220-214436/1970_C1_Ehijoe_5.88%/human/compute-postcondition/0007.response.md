Output State: **`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing the integers that were appended based on the conditions in the loop, `empty` is False if any elements were appended to `tree`, otherwise it remains True, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree` if `start` is in `tree`, otherwise a `ValueError` is raised, `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`**

Explanation:
- `moves` is a new list that is created and assigned the values `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`.
- The first element of `moves` is the minimum of `t` and `idx`.
- The second element of `moves` is the minimum of `t` and `n - idx - 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `tree`, `empty`, `start`, `idx`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
