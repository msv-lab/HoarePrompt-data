#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not correctly defined for the problem. The function should accept parameters `n` and `u_1` where `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5) and `u_1` is an integer representing the starting node (1 \leq u_1 \leq n). Additionally, the function should accept a list of edges, each represented as a tuple of two integers (u, v) with 1 \leq u, v \leq n, indicating the connections between nodes in the tree.
def func_1():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    tree = deque()
    empty = True
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        if empty:
            tree.append(u)
            tree.append(v)
            empty = False
        elif v == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(u)
        elif v == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(u)
        elif u == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(v)
        elif u == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(v)
        
    #State: `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing the integers that were appended based on the conditions in the loop, and `empty` is False if any elements were appended to `tree`, otherwise it remains True.
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing the integers that were appended based on the conditions in the loop, `empty` is False if any elements were appended to `tree`, otherwise it remains True, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree` if `start` is in `tree`, otherwise a `ValueError` is raised, `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`. If any of the elements in `moves` is an odd number, then at least one of the elements in `moves` is odd. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` and `t`, where `n` is the number of nodes in a tree and `t` is an integer. It then reads `n-1` edges of the tree and constructs a deque `tree` based on these edges. The function reads an additional input `start`, which is the starting node. It determines the index of `start` in the `tree` and calculates two potential moves based on the index and the value of `t`. If either of these moves is an odd number, the function prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` contains the nodes appended based on the conditions in the loop, `empty` is False if any elements were appended to `tree`, otherwise it remains True, `start` is the input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree` if `start` is in `tree`, otherwise a `ValueError` is raised, and `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`.
