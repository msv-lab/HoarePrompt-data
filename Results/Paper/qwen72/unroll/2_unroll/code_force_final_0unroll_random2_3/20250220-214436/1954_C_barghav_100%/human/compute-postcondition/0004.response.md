Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of characters where the first differing character between `a` and `b` has been swapped if `a` was initially less than `b`. The flag `f` is set to 1 if any swap occurred or if `a` was greater than `b` at any point. The variables `x`, `y`, and `t` remain unchanged.**
