Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, x and y, which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same length. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to properly handle the inputs:

```python
def maximize_product(x, y):
```

Given this, the precondition for the function `maximize_product` would be:

Precondition: **x and y are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same length.**
