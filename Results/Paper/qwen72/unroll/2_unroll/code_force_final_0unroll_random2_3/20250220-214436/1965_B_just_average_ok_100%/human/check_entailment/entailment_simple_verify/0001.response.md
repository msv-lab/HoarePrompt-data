### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
     - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Approach in the Program:**
   - The program generates a sequence of powers of 2 up to `2^20` (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 1048576]`).
   - It finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and removes it from the sequence.
   - It appends three new elements to the sequence: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the modified sequence and the sequence itself.

3. **Analysis of the Approach:**
   - **Powers of 2:** The sequence of powers of 2 ensures that any integer can be represented as a sum of these elements (since any integer can be expressed in binary using these powers).
   - **Removing a Power of 2:** By removing the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`, the program ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`. This is because the removed element is crucial for forming the sum `k` using the powers of 2.
   - **Adding New Elements:**
     - `k - nums[idx]` is added to ensure that sums close to `k` can be formed.
     - `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are added to ensure that sums greater than `k` can be formed.

4. **Verification:**
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:** Since `nums[idx]` (the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`) is removed, the sum `k` cannot be formed using the remaining elements. This is correct because the removed element is the only one that can contribute to the sum `k` in a binary representation.
   - **All Other Sums from 1 to `n`:** The remaining elements in `nums` can still form all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`. The added elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` help in forming sums that would otherwise be impossible without the removed element.
     - `k - nums[idx]` ensures that sums close to `k` can be formed.
     - `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` ensure that sums greater than `k` can be formed.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is a power of 2 by removing the exact power of 2 and adding the necessary elements to ensure all other sums can be formed.
   - The program also ensures that the sequence size does not exceed 25, which is a constraint in the problem. The sequence size is 23 after the modifications, which is within the limit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` to be formed.

### Correctness:
**True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the program is correct.
