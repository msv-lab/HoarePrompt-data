Output State: **For each test case, the loop outputs the length of the modified `nums` list, followed by the elements of the modified `nums` list. The modified `nums` list will have 23 elements, which are the original powers of 2 up to 2^20, with the element 2^idx removed, and the elements (k - 2^idx), (k + 1), and (k + 2^idx + 1) appended. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.**
