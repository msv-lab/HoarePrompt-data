The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and the context, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.

The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the example. Given the constraints, it is reasonable to assume that the function processes each test case and returns a result for each case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 1000), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers (2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n). The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
