The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n). It then calculates a list `ans` containing specific integers derived from `k` and all powers of 2 from 0 to 19, excluding one particular power of 2. The function prints the length of `ans` and the elements of `ans` for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged after the function execution.
