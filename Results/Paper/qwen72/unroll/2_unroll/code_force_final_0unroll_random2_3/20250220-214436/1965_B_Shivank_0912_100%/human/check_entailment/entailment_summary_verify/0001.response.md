### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v != k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - The program determines the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` by finding the highest bit set in `k` using a while loop.
   - It constructs a sequence `ans` that includes:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This element is included to prevent `k` from being formed.
     - `k + 1`: This element ensures that `k + 1` can be formed.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This element ensures that `k + 1 + (1 << i)` can be formed.
     - All powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` except `2^i` (which is `1 << i`).

3. **Correctness of the Sequence:**
   - **Preventing Subsequence Sum to `k`:**
     - The element `k - (1 << i)` is included to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence. This is because `k` can be expressed as `k - (1 << i) + (1 << i)`, and since `(1 << i)` is excluded, `k` cannot be formed.
   - **Forming All Other Sums:**
     - The sequence includes all powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` except `2^i`. This ensures that any sum that can be formed using these powers can be formed.
     - The additional elements `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` help in forming sums around `k` but not `k` itself.
   - **Sequence Size:**
     - The sequence `ans` is of size at most 25 because it includes at most 20 powers of 2, plus 3 additional elements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is a power of 2 by excluding that specific power of 2 from the sequence.
   - The program ensures that the sequence can form all sums from `1` to `n` except `k` by including a wide range of powers of 2 and additional elements.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient and runs within the constraints provided.
   - The loop to find the highest bit set in `k` runs in constant time.
   - The loop to append powers of 2 runs in a fixed number of iterations (20).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from `1` to `n` to be formed. The sequence is of size at most 25, and the program handles edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
