To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `tc` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0, and `tc` will start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.

For the loop to execute:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `tc` must be 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `tc` is 0**
