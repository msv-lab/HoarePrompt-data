Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`, and `h` is 0.**

The variable `h` is initialized to 0, while the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `costs` remain unchanged. The conditions that `n` and `k` are positive integers, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k` still hold. The list `costs` still contains the values `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
