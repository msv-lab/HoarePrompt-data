The code snippet initializes a list `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, but the list `costs` is now populated with these specific values.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`.**
