Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, which represent the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, the program prints "YES", followed by `1` and `1`. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at `1` coin each, and she will have `n - k` coins left, which is `0` in this case.

3. **Invalid Case Handling:**
   - If `n` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

4. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program initializes `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over the `costs` array, calculating the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall (`curr = n // i`), updating `h` with the total number of jewels bought, and reducing `n` by the cost of the jewels bought (`n -= i * curr`).
   - The loop ensures that Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall, starting with the higher price (`n - k + 1`) and then the lower price (`1`).

5. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints "YES", followed by `2` (indicating two stalls), and the prices of the stalls (`n - k + 1` and `1`).

6. **Correctness of the General Case:**
   - The logic of setting the prices to `n - k + 1` and `1` ensures that Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall and then the remaining jewels from the second stall.
   - The first stall price `n - k + 1` ensures that Alice buys exactly `1` jewel from it (since `n // (n - k + 1) = 1`), and the second stall price `1` ensures that she can buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels (since `n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1` and `k - 1 // 1 = k - 1`).

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` is equal to `k` and where `n` is less than `k` correctly.
   - The general case logic also works for larger values of `n` and `k` within the given constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
