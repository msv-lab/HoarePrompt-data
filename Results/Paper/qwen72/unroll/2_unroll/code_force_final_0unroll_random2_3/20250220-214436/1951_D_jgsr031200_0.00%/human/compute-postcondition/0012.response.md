For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the `costs` list has at least one element. The state of `i` will be adjusted as it is the loop variable, and it will take the value of the elements in `costs` during each iteration. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `h`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18
- `n` is not equal to `k`
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`
- `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `h` is 0

The `costs` list is already guaranteed to have at least one element, as it contains `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Therefore, the loop can execute without any adjustments to `n`, `k`, or `h`.

However, for the loop to start, `i` must be set to the first element of `costs`.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is 0, `i` is the first element of `costs` which is `n - k + 1`**
