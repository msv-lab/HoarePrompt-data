You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= n, k <= 10^18) and performs the following actions based on the input values:

- If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints "YES" followed by two "1"s and then returns.
- If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" and then returns.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each element in the list `[n - k + 1, 1]` and updates `n` accordingly. If the sum of these quotients (`h`) is less than `k`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "2", "YES", and the elements of the list `[n - k + 1, 1]` (which are `1 - k` and `1`).

In all cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
   - Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next, and so on.
   - The goal is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and, if so, provide the number of stalls and their prices.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (Alice's coins) and `k` (desired number of jewels).
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is called to determine if it's possible to set up the stalls and, if so, to print the number of stalls and their prices.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)`:**
   - **Case 1: `n == k`**
     - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
     - The program correctly prints "YES" and the stall setup with a single stall priced at 1.
   - **Case 2: `n < k`**
     - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it's impossible.
     - The program correctly prints "NO".
   - **Case 3: General Case**
     - The program initializes `costs` with two prices: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
     - It then calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each of these two stalls.
     - The variable `h` is used to accumulate the total number of jewels bought.
     - If the total number of jewels bought `h` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the two prices.

4. **Critical Analysis:**
   - The program assumes that setting up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1` will always work if `n >= k`.
   - However, this assumption is incorrect. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the program will set up two stalls with prices `8` and `1`.
     - Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (10 // 8 = 1) and 10 - 8 = 2 coins left.
     - Alice will then buy 2 jewels from the second stall (2 // 1 = 2).
     - Total jewels bought = 1 + 2 = 3, which is correct.
   - But if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the program will set up two stalls with prices `7` and `1`.
     - Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (10 // 7 = 1) and 10 - 7 = 3 coins left.
     - Alice will then buy 3 jewels from the second stall (3 // 1 = 3).
     - Total jewels bought = 1 + 3 = 4, which is correct.
   - However, if `n = 10` and `k = 5`, the program will set up two stalls with prices `6` and `1`.
     - Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (10 // 6 = 1) and 10 - 6 = 4 coins left.
     - Alice will then buy 4 jewels from the second stall (4 // 1 = 4).
     - Total jewels bought = 1 + 4 = 5, which is correct.
   - The program does not handle cases where more than two stalls are needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

5. **Correct Solution:**
   - To ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, Bob can set up `k` stalls, each with a price of 1 coin.
   - This guarantees that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, as she will buy one jewel from each of the first `k` stalls and then stop.
   - If `k > 60`, it is impossible to set up the store as Bob can only set up at most 60 stalls.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where more than two stalls are needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. A correct solution would involve setting up `k` stalls, each with a price of 1 coin, if `k` is less than or equal to 60, and returning "NO" if `k` is greater than 60.
