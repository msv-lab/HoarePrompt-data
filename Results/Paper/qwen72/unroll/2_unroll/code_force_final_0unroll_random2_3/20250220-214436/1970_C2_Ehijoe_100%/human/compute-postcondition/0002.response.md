Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers provided by the user input, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where 1 ≤ `start` ≤ `n`, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**

The variable `empty` has been assigned the value `True`. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `nodes`, `start`, `edges`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
