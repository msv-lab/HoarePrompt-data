The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `nodes` (a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree), `start` (an integer representing the starting node, where 1 <= start <= len(nodes)), and `parent` (an integer representing the parent node of the starting node or None if there is no parent). The function returns `False` if the starting node has only one adjacent node, and that node is the parent. Otherwise, it recursively checks the children of the starting node (excluding the parent node) and returns `True` if any of these recursive calls return `False`, otherwise it returns `False`. The function does not modify the `nodes`, `start`, or `parent` parameters.
