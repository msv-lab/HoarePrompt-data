Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly solves the problem by calculating the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. Here's why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` on your cards.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: It initializes a list `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand. This is done using a loop that increments the count for each integer in `a`.

3. **Calculating Points**: The program then calculates the maximum number of points you can get. For each integer `x` in `cnt`, if `x` appears more than once in your hand, you can score a point for the second occurrence (and any subsequent occurrences). The expression `max(0, x - 1)` ensures that you only count the points for the second and subsequent occurrences of each integer.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of points you can score.

The program correctly handles the following aspects:
- It ensures that each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in your hand.
- It calculates the points based on the optimal strategy, where you score a point for the second occurrence of each integer in your hand.
- It correctly handles multiple test cases.

The program does not need to simulate the entire game because the optimal strategy for you is to play the second occurrence of each integer in your hand, and the optimal strategy for Nene is to play the first occurrence of each integer in her hand. This ensures that you can only score points for the second occurrence of each integer in your hand, which is exactly what the program calculates.

Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
