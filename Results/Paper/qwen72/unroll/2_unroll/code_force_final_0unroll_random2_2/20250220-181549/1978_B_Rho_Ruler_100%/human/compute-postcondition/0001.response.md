Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum value between `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0.**

The initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain within the specified range. The value of `low` is still 0, and `high` is still the minimum value between `n` and `b`. The variable `max_profit` is now initialized to 0.
