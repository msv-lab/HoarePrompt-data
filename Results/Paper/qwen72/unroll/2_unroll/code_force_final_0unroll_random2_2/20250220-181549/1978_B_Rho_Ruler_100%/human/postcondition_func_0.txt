The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integers `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b` with the constraints `0 <= k <= min(n, b)` and `1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9`. It returns a single integer value, which is the result of the expression `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. This value represents a combination of linear and quadratic terms involving `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function does not modify any of its input parameters.
