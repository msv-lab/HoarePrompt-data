The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`. It returns the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the list `count` is a local variable that is not returned or modified outside the function.
