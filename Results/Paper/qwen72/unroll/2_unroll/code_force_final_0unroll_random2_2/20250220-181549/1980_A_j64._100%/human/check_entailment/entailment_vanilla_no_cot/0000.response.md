Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the number of problems and rounds, and the string representing the difficulties of the problems. The function `func_1` then calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that there are enough problems of each difficulty level to hold the specified number of rounds. The program correctly handles the constraints and produces the expected output for the provided examples.
