Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to hold `m` rounds, where each round requires one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by a string `a` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.

The function `func_1` performs the following steps:
1. Initializes a list `count` of length 7 (to represent the counts of difficulties 'A' to 'G') with all elements set to 0.
2. Iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `count` for each character based on its ASCII value.
3. Calculates the number of additional problems needed by iterating over the `count` list and adding the difference between `m` and the current count to `needed_problems` for each difficulty level that has fewer than `m` problems.
4. Returns the total number of additional problems needed.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It ensures that each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G' has at least `m` problems, and it calculates the minimum number of additional problems required to achieve this.

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected, and the program's output matches the expected results for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
