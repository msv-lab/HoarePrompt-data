### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Choosing `k`**:
   - The program sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This is a key part of the logic:
     - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not more profitable than the usual price, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price. This is handled correctly by the `if b <= a` condition.
     - If `b > a`, the program calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This ensures that Bob does not choose a `k` that is greater than the number of buns or the difference between the modified and usual prices.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, the profit is simply `a * n` because all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is calculated as:
     - `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`: This part calculates the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price. The formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - `(n - k) * a`: This part calculates the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which is the correct format for the output.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1**: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
  - Profit = `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
  - Correct output: `17`

- **Example 2**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 5`
  - Profit = `9 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 + 0 = 35`
  - Correct output: `35`

- **Example 3**: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0` (since `b - a` is negative, `k` is set to 0)
  - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`
  - Correct output: `100`

- **Example 4**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
  - Profit = `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 + 0 = 45`
  - Correct output: `45`

- **Example 5**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
  - Correct output: `1000000000000000000`

- **Example 6**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0` (since `b - a` is negative, `k` is set to 0)
  - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
  - Correct output: `1000000000000000000`

- **Example 7**: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
  - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
  - Profit = `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500`
  - Correct output: `500500`
