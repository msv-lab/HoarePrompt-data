You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within the range 1 to 10^9. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the following logic: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`; otherwise, it prints `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Choosing `k`**: The program sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This is a key part of the logic:
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not more profitable than the usual price, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price. This is handled correctly by the `if b <= a` condition.
   - If `b > a`, the program calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This ensures that Bob does not choose a `k` that is greater than the number of buns or the difference between the modified and usual prices.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, the profit is simply `a * n` because all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is calculated as:
     - `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`: This part calculates the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price. The formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - `(n - k) * a`: This part calculates the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which is the correct format for the output.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1**: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
  - Profit = `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
  - Correct output: `17`

- **Example 2**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 5`
  - Profit = `9 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 + 0 = 35`
  - Correct output: `35`

- **Example 3**: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0` (since `b - a` is negative, `k` is set to 0)
  - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`
  - Correct output: `100`

- **Example 4**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
  - Profit = `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 + 0 = 45`
  - Correct output: `45`

- **Example 5**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
  - Correct output: `1000000000000000000`

- **Example 6**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0` (since `b - a` is negative, `k` is set to 0)
  - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
  - Correct output: `1000000000000000000`

- **Example 7**: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
  - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
  - Profit = `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500`
  - Correct output: `500500`
