Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of distinct types of cards `n` and the number of coins `k`, followed by a list `a` of `n` integers representing the number of cards of each type. The function then calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be bought with the given number of coins `k` such that the total cost of the cards is minimized. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are not modified in the output state, but the loop computes and prints the result for each test case. **
