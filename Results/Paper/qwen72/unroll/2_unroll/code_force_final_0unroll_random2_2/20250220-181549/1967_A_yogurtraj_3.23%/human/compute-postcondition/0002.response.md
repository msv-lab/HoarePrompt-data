The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of each type. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

The function returns the result of each test case, which is determined based on the number of coins `k` and the list of card counts `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the result for each test case based on the number of coins `k` and the list of card counts `a`.**
