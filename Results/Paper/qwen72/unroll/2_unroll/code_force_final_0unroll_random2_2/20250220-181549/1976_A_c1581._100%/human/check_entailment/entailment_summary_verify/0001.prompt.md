You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `password`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length of 1 to 20 characters. It separates the digits and letters from the `password` into two lists, `digits` and `letters`, respectively. The function then sorts these lists. If the sorted digits are not in non-decreasing order or if the largest digit is greater than any of the letters, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it concatenates the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists into a new string `sortedPassword`. The function returns `True` if `sortedPassword` is equal to the original `password`, and `False` otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Character Segregation**:
   - The `func_1` function segregates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - This is done by iterating through each character in the password and checking if it is a digit or a letter using the `isdigit` method.

3. **Sorting and Validation**:
   - The `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted individually.
   - The program then checks if the sorted `digits` list is in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing each digit with the next one in the list.
   - The program also checks if any digit in the sorted `digits` list comes after any letter in the sorted `letters` list. This is done by comparing the last digit with each letter in the `letters` list.

4. **Reconstruction and Final Check**:
   - The program reconstructs the password by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists.
   - It then compares the reconstructed password with the original password to check if the original password was already sorted in the required manner.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles passwords that consist only of letters or only of digits correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the password is empty or has a single character correctly.

### Issues:
- **Digit and Letter Order Check**:
  - The condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect. It should check if any digit comes after any letter in the original password, not just the last digit.
  - The correct approach should be to ensure that all digits appear before any letters in the original password.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits are in non-decreasing order
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return False
    
    # Check if letters are in non-decreasing order
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    # Check if all digits come before any letters
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isdigit() and password[i + 1].isalpha():
            return False
    
    return True
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Digit and Letter Order Check**:
  - The program now checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - It also checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - Finally, it checks if any digit in the original password comes before a letter by iterating through the password and comparing adjacent characters.

### Final Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the digit and letter order check.
- The corrected program should work correctly for all test cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the logical error in the digit and letter order check.)
