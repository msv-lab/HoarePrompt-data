### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - The game involves a circle of coins, each of which can be either "U" (up) or "D" (down).
   - Players take turns to remove a facing-up coin and flip its adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when no facing-up coins are left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Observation:**
   - The critical factor in determining the winner is the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always ensure that Bob is left with an even number of facing-up coins, and vice versa.
   - This is because each move changes the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Removing one facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins will change the number of facing-up coins by an odd number (either +1 or -1).

3. **Optimal Play:**
   - If the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of facing-up coins.
   - If the initial number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always make a move that leaves Alice with an odd number of facing-up coins.
   - Therefore, the player who starts with an odd number of facing-up coins will always win if both players play optimally.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`.
   - It returns "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if the count is even.
   - This logic aligns with the key observation that the player who starts with an odd number of facing-up coins will win.

5. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It correctly processes the number of test cases `t` and the number of coins `n` and the string `s` for each test case.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the input for multiple test cases. It should iterate over the correct indices in the `data` list to process each test case.

### Correctness:
- The logic within `func_1` is correct.
- However, the input handling is incorrect. The program should iterate over the correct indices in the `data` list to process each test case.

### Corrected Input Handling:
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    s = data[index + 1]
    print(func_1(s))
    index += 2
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program's logic for determining the winner is correct, but the input handling is flawed, leading to incorrect results for multiple test cases.
