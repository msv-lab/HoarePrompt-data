### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves a circle of coins, each facing up ("U") or down ("D").
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when no facing-up coins are left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If there is an odd number of facing-up coins, the player who starts (Alice) can always ensure that the number of facing-up coins remains odd after her turn.
   - If there is an even number of facing-up coins, the player who starts (Alice) will always leave an even number of facing-up coins after her turn, and Bob can then ensure that the number of facing-up coins remains even after his turn.

3. **Winning Strategy:**
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always win because she will always be the one to make the last move.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always win because he will always be the one to make the last move.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it counts the number of facing-up coins (`num_up`).
   - If `num_up` is odd, it returns "YES" (Alice wins).
   - If `num_up` is even, it returns "NO" (Bob wins).

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The input is correctly read and split.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the correct string `s` for each test case.
   - The output is correctly formatted as "YES" or "NO" based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where there are no facing-up coins correctly (returns "NO").
   - It also handles the case where there is only one coin correctly (returns "YES" if it is "U", "NO" if it is "D").

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem description and the winning strategy.

### Correctness:
**True**
