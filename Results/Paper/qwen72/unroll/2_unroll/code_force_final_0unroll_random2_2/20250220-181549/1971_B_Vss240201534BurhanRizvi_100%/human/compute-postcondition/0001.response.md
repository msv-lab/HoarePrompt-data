Output State: The loop processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input. If the string `s` has a length of 1 or all characters in `s` are the same, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of `s` that is guaranteed to be different from the original `s`. After all iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `s` will hold the value of the last input string processed in the loop.
