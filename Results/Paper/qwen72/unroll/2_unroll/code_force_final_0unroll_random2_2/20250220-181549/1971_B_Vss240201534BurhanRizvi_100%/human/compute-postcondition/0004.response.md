Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If the string `s` has a length of 1 or all characters in `s` are the same, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of `s` that is different from the original `s`. The variable `s` is re-assigned in each iteration based on the input provided, and the loop runs `t` times. After all iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and `s` will be the last input string processed in the loop. **
