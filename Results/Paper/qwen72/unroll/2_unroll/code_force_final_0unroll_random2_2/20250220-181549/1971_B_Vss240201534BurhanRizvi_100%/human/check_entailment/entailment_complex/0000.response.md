Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading a string `s`.
2. **Single Character String**: If the length of `s` is 1, the function correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single character string to be different from itself.
3. **All Characters the Same**: If all characters in `s` are the same (checked using `len(set(s)) == 1`), the function correctly prints "No" because any rearrangement will still result in the same string.
4. **Shuffling**: The function attempts to shuffle the string using `random.sample(s, len(s))`. This is a valid approach to generate a random permutation of the string.
5. **Ensuring Different String**: If the shuffled string `s2` happens to be the same as the original string `s`, the function changes `s2` to `s[1:] + s[0]`, which is a valid way to ensure that the new string is different from the original.
6. **Output**: The function correctly prints "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2` if the conditions are met.

The function handles all the specified cases and ensures that the output is correct for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
