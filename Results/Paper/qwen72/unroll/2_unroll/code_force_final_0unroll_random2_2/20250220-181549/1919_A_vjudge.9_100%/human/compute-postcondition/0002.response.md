Output State: **The loop has executed t times, and for each iteration, it has read two integers a and b from the input. If the absolute difference between a and b is even, it has printed 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between a and b is odd, it has printed 'Alice'. The values of t, a, and b are unchanged after the loop, but the loop has completed its execution and produced the specified output for each test case.**
