The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in its definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and an additional parameter `t` that represents the number of test cases. Each of `a` and `b` are integers within the range 1 to 10^9, and `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact return value. However, given the context, it is likely that the function processes `a` and `b` for each test case and returns a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `a` and `b` within the range 1 to 10^9. The function returns a result based on the processing of `a` and `b` for each test case.**
