Reasoning:

The key to determining the winner of the game lies in the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Initial Observation**: If Alice and Bob have an equal number of coins (i.e., \(a = b\)), then the absolute difference \(|a - b|\) is 0, which is even. In such a case, Bob will always win because the game will end in a state where both wallets are empty, and it will be Alice's turn to move, making her unable to perform a valid move.

2. **Odd Difference**: If the absolute difference \(|a - b|\) is odd, then Alice can always force Bob into a losing position. Alice can start by swapping wallets if necessary to make sure she has the wallet with the larger number of coins. After each move, the difference between the number of coins in the wallets will remain odd. Eventually, Bob will be forced into a position where he has to take the last coin, leaving Alice with a non-empty wallet, and thus Alice wins.

3. **Even Difference**: If the absolute difference \(|a - b|\) is even, then Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. For example, if Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice doesn't swap, Bob doesn't swap. This ensures that the game will end in a state where both wallets are empty, and it will be Alice's turn to move, making her unable to perform a valid move, and thus Bob wins.

Given the above reasoning, the program checks the parity of the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\) and prints "Bob" if the difference is even, and "Alice" if the difference is odd. This logic aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case by reading the number of coins \(a\) and \(b\). It correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the difference and prints the result.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
