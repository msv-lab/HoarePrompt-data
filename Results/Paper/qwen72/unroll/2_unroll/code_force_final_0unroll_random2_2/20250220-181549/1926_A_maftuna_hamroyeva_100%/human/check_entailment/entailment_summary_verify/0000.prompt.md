You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of input strings to process. For each of the `t` input strings, it counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. If the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` input strings have been processed, and the corresponding 'A' or 'B' has been printed for each string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 'A's and 'B's in the string are equal. According to the problem description, the output should be the character that appears most frequently. If both characters appear the same number of times, the program should specify a clear rule for which character to output (e.g., always output 'A' in case of a tie). However, the current program will output 'B' in such cases, which is incorrect. For example, for the input "ABABA", the program will output 'B' instead of 'A'.
