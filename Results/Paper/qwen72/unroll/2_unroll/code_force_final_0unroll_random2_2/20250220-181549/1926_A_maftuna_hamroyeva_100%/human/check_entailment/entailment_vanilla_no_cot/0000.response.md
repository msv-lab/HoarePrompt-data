Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 and counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. It then prints the letter that appears most frequently. The logic and the structure of the program are correct and align with the problem requirements.
