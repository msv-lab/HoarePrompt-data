The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of edges, where 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2).
- `k` is an integer representing a specific value, where 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5.
- Each of the `m` lines contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, where `a_i` and `b_i` are distinct nodes (1 <= a_i, b_i <= n) and `f_i` is a value associated with the edge between `a_i` and `b_i` (1 <= f_i <= 10^9).

The function returns a result for each test case based on the parameters and the edges provided. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` edges, each represented by three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. It returns a result for each test case based on these parameters.**
