Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the friendship values. Specifically, the formula used in the program to calculate the expected value is incorrect.

The program calculates the expected value as:
\[ \text{p} = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \]
\[ \text{q} = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2 \]

However, the correct formula for the expected value should be:
\[ \text{p} = k \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \]
\[ \text{q} = \text{cn2} \]

This is because:
1. The initial sum of friendship values is \( \text{sum_f} \).
2. For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the friendship values of all pairs of friends divided by the total number of possible pairs (which is \( \text{cn2} \)).
3. The expected increase for each pair of friends over \( k \) excursions is \( \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \) because each pair of friends has a \( \frac{1}{\text{cn2}} \) chance of being chosen in each excursion, and if chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion.

Thus, the program's formula is incorrect, leading to incorrect results for some test cases. For example, consider the test case:
\[ n = 3, m = 1, k = 2 \]
\[ \text{friends} = (1, 2, 1) \]

The correct expected value should be:
\[ \text{sum_f} = 1 \]
\[ \text{cn2} = 3 \]
\[ \text{p} = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot \frac{2 \cdot 1}{2} = 2 + 1 = 3 \]
\[ \text{q} = 3 \]

The expected value is \( \frac{3}{3} = 1 \), but the program would calculate it incorrectly.
