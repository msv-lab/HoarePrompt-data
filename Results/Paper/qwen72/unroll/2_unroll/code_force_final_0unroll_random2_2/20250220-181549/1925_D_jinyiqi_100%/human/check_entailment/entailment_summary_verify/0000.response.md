### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `m` lines of input, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The initial sum of friendship values is \( \text{sum_f} \).
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the friendship values of all pairs of friends divided by the total number of possible pairs (which is \( \text{cn2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \)).
   - The expected increase for each pair of friends over \( k \) excursions is \( \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \) because each pair of friends has a \( \frac{1}{\text{cn2}} \) chance of being chosen in each excursion, and if chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion.

#### Program Analysis:
The program provided calculates the expected value using the following formula:
\[ \text{p} = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \]
\[ \text{q} = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2 \]

However, the correct formula should be:
\[ \text{p} = k \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \]
\[ \text{q} = \text{cn2} \]

Let's analyze why the program's formula is incorrect:

1. **Initial Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly calculates the initial sum of friendship values as \( \text{sum_f} \).

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Values:**
   - The program calculates the expected increase in friendship values as \( 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} \). This is incorrect because the expected increase should be \( k \cdot \text{sum_f} \).
   - The program also calculates an additional term \( m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \). This term is intended to account for the increase in friendship values over subsequent excursions, but it is not correctly scaled by \( \text{cn2} \).

3. **Correct Formula:**
   - The correct expected increase in friendship values for each excursion is \( \frac{\text{sum_f}}{\text{cn2}} \).
   - Over \( k \) excursions, the total expected increase is \( k \cdot \frac{\text{sum_f}}{\text{cn2}} \).
   - Additionally, for each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value over \( k \) excursions is \( \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \) because each pair has a \( \frac{1}{\text{cn2}} \) chance of being chosen in each excursion, and if chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion.

4. **Modular Inverse:**
   - The program correctly uses the modular inverse to compute the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Example Test Case:
For the test case:
\[ n = 3, m = 1, k = 2 \]
\[ \text{friends} = (1, 2, 1) \]

- The correct expected value should be:
  \[ \text{sum_f} = 1 \]
  \[ \text{cn2} = 3 \]
  \[ \text{p} = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot \frac{2 \cdot 1}{2} = 2 + 1 = 3 \]
  \[ \text{q} = 3 \]

- The expected value is \( \frac{3}{3} = 1 \).

However, the program would calculate:
\[ \text{p} = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 12 + 2 = 14 \]
\[ \text{q} = 2 \cdot 3^2 = 18 \]

- The expected value is \( \frac{14}{18} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{7}{9} \), and the modular inverse calculation would yield an incorrect result.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program's formula for calculating the expected value is incorrect, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

Final: **False**
