Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the formula used in the program to calculate the expected value is incorrect. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Initial Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - The program correctly calculates the initial sum of friendship values (`sum_f`) by summing up the friendship values of all pairs of friends.

2. **Total Number of Possible Pairs**:
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of possible pairs of children (`cn2`) using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program uses the formula:
     \[
     \text{p} = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     \text{q} = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
     \]
   - This formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
     \[
     \text{p} = k \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{q} = \text{cn2}
     \]

4. **Explanation of the Correct Formula**:
   - **Initial Sum**: The initial sum of friendship values is `sum_f`.
   - **Expected Increase per Excursion**: The expected increase in the sum of friendship values per excursion is the sum of the friendship values of all pairs of friends divided by the total number of possible pairs, which is \( \frac{\text{sum_f}}{\text{cn2}} \).
   - **Total Expected Increase**: Over \( k \) excursions, the total expected increase in the sum of friendship values is \( k \cdot \frac{\text{sum_f}}{\text{cn2}} \).
   - **Additional Increase for Chosen Pairs**: Each pair of friends has a \( \frac{1}{\text{cn2}} \) chance of being chosen in each excursion. If chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion. The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen over \( k \) excursions is \( \frac{k}{\text{cn2}} \). The expected total increase in friendship values for all pairs of friends over \( k \) excursions is \( m \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}} \).

5. **Combining the Terms**:
   - The total expected value of the sum of friendship values after \( k \) excursions is:
     \[
     \text{sum_f} + m \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}}
     \]
   - This can be simplified to:
     \[
     \text{p} = k \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{q} = \text{cn2}
     \]

6. **Example Test Case**:
   - For the test case \( n = 3, m = 1, k = 2 \) with the pair \( (1, 2, 1) \):
     - \(\text{sum_f} = 1\)
     - \(\text{cn2} = 3\)
     - \(\text{p} = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot \frac{2 \cdot 1}{2} = 2 + 1 = 3\)
     - \(\text{q} = 3\)
     - The expected value is \( \frac{3}{3} = 1 \), which is correct.

The program's formula:
\[
\text{p} = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
\]
\[
\text{q} = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
\]
is incorrect and does not match the correct expected value calculation.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the incorrect formula used in the program.

Final: **False**
