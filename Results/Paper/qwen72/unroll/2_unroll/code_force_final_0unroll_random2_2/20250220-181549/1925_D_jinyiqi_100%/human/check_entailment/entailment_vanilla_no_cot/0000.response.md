Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The formula used in the program to calculate the expected value is incorrect. The program calculates `p` and `q` as follows:
     ```python
     p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
     q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
     ```
   - This formula does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values over the k excursions.

2. **Correct Formula:**
   - The correct expected value for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions can be derived as follows:
     - The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends in any given excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
     - The expected increase in the friendship value of a specific pair of friends over k excursions is \(\frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times k\).
     - The total expected increase in the sum of friendship values over k excursions is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase for each pair:
       \[
       \text{Expected Sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i \times \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times k \right)
       \]
     - Simplifying, we get:
       \[
       \text{Expected Sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \times \left( 1 + \frac{2mk}{n(n-1)} \right)
       \]
     - This can be further simplified to:
       \[
       \text{Expected Sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \times \left( 1 + \frac{2mk}{n(n-1)} \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + \frac{2mk \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i}{n(n-1)}
       \]
     - Finally, the expected sum can be expressed as:
       \[
       \text{Expected Sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \times \left( 1 + \frac{2mk}{n(n-1)} \right)
       \]

3. **Modular Inverse:**
   - The program correctly uses the modular inverse to compute the final result, but the formula for the expected value needs to be fixed.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        sum_f = 0
        for j in range(m):
            (a, b, f) = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
        if cn2 == 0:
            print(0)
            continue
        p = sum_f * (1 + (2 * m * k) // cn2)
        q = 1
        print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Handling:** The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- **Sum of Friendship Values:** It calculates the sum of the initial friendship values.
- **Expected Value Calculation:** It correctly computes the expected value using the formula derived above.
- **Modular Inverse:** Since `q` is 1, the modular inverse of `q` is 1, so the final result is simply `p % M`.

This corrected program should now correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the given problem.
