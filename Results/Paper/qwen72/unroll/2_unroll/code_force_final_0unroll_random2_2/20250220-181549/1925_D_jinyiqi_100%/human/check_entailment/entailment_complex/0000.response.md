### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The function correctly calculates the sum of the initial friendship values `sum_f` for all pairs of friends.

3. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n` using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), which is stored in `cn2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values is derived from the problem statement. The expected value for each pair being chosen is \( \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2} \).
   - The numerator `p` is calculated as \( 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1) \).
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as \( 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2 \).

5. **Fraction Simplification:**
   - The function correctly simplifies the fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

6. **Modular Inverse and Result:**
   - The function calculates the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)`, where `M = 10^9 + 7`.
   - It then prints the result of \( (p \cdot \text{mod\_inv}(q)) \mod M \).

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `m` is 0 (no friends) correctly by printing 0.
   - The function also handles the case where `m` is 1 (one pair of friends) correctly by summing up the increasing friendship values.

### Correctness:
The program appears to follow the problem statement and constraints correctly. It handles the input and output as specified, and the calculations for the expected value and modular inverse are implemented correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
