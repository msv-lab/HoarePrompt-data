Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, a_i â‰  b_i, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. The function calculates a result based on these inputs and prints it. The result is the modular inverse of a fraction `(p/q) % M`, where `M = 10^9 + 7`, and `p` and `q` are derived from the inputs. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case. The values of `t`, `M`, and the input constraints remain unchanged. **
