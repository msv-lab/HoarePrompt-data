Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days, with the constraints that a person can buy no more than `m` tickets per day, and each ticket purchase on a day increases the price of tickets for subsequent days.

However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation of the program:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is initialized as `k * k / 2`, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. The initial cost should be zero since no tickets have been bought yet.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation inside the loop is incorrect. The formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` does not correctly account for the cost of tickets bought on each day. The correct formula should be `c += l[i] * s` to add the cost of `s` tickets bought at the price `l[i]`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of `k`**:
   - The variable `k` is used to track the remaining number of tickets to be bought. However, the loop should continue until `k` is zero, not just for `n` iterations. The loop should break once `k` reaches zero.

4. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - Sorting the prices `l` is a good strategy to minimize the cost, as it ensures that tickets are bought at the lowest possible prices first.

5. **Maximum Tickets per Day**:
   - The program correctly buys the maximum number of tickets `m` per day, but it should also handle the case where `k` is less than `m` by buying exactly `k` tickets on the last day.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and will not produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
