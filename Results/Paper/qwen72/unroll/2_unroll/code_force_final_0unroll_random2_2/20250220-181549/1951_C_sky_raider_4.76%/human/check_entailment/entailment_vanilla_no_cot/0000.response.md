Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is initialized as `k * k / 2`, which is not a valid initialization for the problem. This value does not represent any meaningful part of the solution.
   - The calculation `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is incorrect. The term `s * s / 2` is not part of the required logic to compute the minimum cost.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Purchasing Tickets**:
   - The program uses `s = min(m, k)` to determine the number of tickets to buy each day, which is correct. However, the way it updates the cost `c` is flawed.
   - The correct way to update the cost should be to simply add the cost of the tickets bought on that day to the total cost, without the unnecessary subtraction.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The final output should be the total cost of purchasing `k` tickets, which is stored in `s` in the corrected logic, not `c`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        total_cost = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if k == 0:
                break
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k)
            total_cost += l[i] * tickets_to_buy
            k -= tickets_to_buy
        print(total_cost)
```

This corrected version:
- Initializes `total_cost` to 0.
- Sorts the list of ticket prices.
- Iterates through the sorted list, buying the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining `k` tickets each day.
- Updates the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets bought on that day.
- Stops the loop once all `k` tickets are bought.
- Prints the total cost.

This should correctly solve the problem as described.
