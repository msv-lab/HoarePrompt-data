The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows`. The parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers with the following constraints: 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The parameter `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers. The first and last elements of each inner list are always 0, and all other elements in the inner lists are integers in the range 0 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ m.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows`. It returns a value based on the provided parameters, but the exact return value is not specified in the given information.**
