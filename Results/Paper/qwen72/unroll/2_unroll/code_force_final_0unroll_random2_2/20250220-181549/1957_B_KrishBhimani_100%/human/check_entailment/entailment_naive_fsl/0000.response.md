Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n`. In such a scenario, it is impossible to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` because each integer must be at least 0, and the sum of `n` zeros is 0, which is less than `k` if `k` is positive. However, the program does not check for this condition and will still attempt to construct a sequence, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 2
```
Here, `n = 3` and `k = 2`. The program will output:
```
3 0 0
```
However, this output is incorrect because the sum of the sequence is 3, not 2. The correct output should indicate that it is impossible to construct such a sequence, or it should output a valid sequence that sums to 2, such as:
```
2 0 0
```
or
```
1 1 0
```

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
