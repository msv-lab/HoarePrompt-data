Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. For each test case, if `n` is 1, it prints `k`. Otherwise, it prints a list of `n` integers where the first integer is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, the second integer is the remainder of `k` after subtracting the first integer, and the remaining `n-2` integers are 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. **
