### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum `s` of the array `a`.

3. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `t` and `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array `a` to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray that can be added to the array. This is done using a sliding window approach where `tmp` keeps track of the current subarray sum, and `t` keeps track of the maximum subarray sum found so far.
   - If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to 0 because a negative sum would not contribute to maximizing the total sum.

4. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is calculated as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. This ensures that the result is non-negative and within the modulo range.

5. **Operations Loop:**
   - The program then performs `k - 1` operations. In each operation, it doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` and adds it to the answer `ans`, taking modulo `MOD` at each step to prevent overflow.

6. **Output:**
   - The final answer for each test case is printed.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum `s` of the array `a` is correctly calculated using `sum(a)`.

- **Correctness of Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
  - The program correctly finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray using a sliding window approach. This is a standard technique for finding the maximum subarray sum, known as Kadane's algorithm.

- **Correctness of Initial Answer Calculation:**
  - The initial answer `ans` is correctly calculated by adding the sum of the array `s` and the maximum subarray sum `t`, and taking the result modulo `MOD`.

- **Correctness of Operations Loop:**
  - The loop correctly doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` for `k - 1` operations and adds it to the answer `ans`, taking modulo `MOD` at each step to ensure the result remains within the valid range.

- **Handling of Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where the array contains only negative numbers by resetting `tmp` to 0 when it becomes negative.
  - The program also correctly handles the case where `k` is 1, as it only adds the maximum subarray sum once.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It follows the steps of summing the array, finding the maximum subarray sum, and performing the operations to maximize the sum of the array, all while taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correctness:
**True**
