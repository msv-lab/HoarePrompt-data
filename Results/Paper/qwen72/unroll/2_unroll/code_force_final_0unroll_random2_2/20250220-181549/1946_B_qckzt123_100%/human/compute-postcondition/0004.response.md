The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` and `k` are integers representing the size of the list `a` and a parameter `k`, respectively, with the constraint 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` has the constraint -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
