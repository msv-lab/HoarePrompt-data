You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
        
        s = sum(a)
        
        t, tmp = 0, 0
        
        for x in a:
            tmp += x
            if tmp < 0:
                tmp = 0
            t = max(tmp, t)
        
        ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
        
        for i in range(k - 1):
            t *= 2
            t %= MOD
            ans += t
            ans %= MOD
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The variable `T` is decremented by the number of iterations that have been completed. The variables `n`, `k`, and `a` are updated for each iteration based on the input. The variable `s` is the sum of the list `a` for the current iteration. The variable `t` is the maximum subarray sum ending at any index in the list `a` for the current iteration, but reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. The variable `tmp` is the running sum used to calculate `t` and is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. The variable `ans` is the final computed value for the current iteration, which is printed. The variable `MOD` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
