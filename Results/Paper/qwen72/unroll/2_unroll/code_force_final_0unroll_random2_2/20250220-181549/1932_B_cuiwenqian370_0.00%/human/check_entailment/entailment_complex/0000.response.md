Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially. The provided functions, however, do not correctly implement this logic. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function is designed to process a list of strings where each string is either '@' or '*'. However, the problem description does not mention any such list. Instead, it specifies a list of integers representing the periodicities of the signs.
   - The function uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid signs ('@') in the path, but this is not relevant to the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign occurs.
   - The function returns the maximum count of valid signs, which is not the year of the n-th sign.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It incorrectly assumes that the input for each test case is a single string (`path`), which should actually be a list of integers.
   - It calls `func_1` with a single string, which is not the correct input format for the problem.

Given these issues, the provided functions do not solve the problem as described. The correct approach would involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs, starting from the first sign and incrementing the year accordingly.

Correctness: **False**
