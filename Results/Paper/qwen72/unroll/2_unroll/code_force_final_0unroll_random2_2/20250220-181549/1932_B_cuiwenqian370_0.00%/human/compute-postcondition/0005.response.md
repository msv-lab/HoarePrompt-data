The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `data`, `index`, and `results` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
