Output State: **`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path` and is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` is 2.**

Explanation: The initial state specifies that `path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path` and is greater than 1, and `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`. If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is 1. The second element of `path` is '@'. The code snippet updates `dp[1]` by adding 1 to `dp[0]` because `path[1]` is '@'. Therefore, `dp[1]` becomes 2. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
