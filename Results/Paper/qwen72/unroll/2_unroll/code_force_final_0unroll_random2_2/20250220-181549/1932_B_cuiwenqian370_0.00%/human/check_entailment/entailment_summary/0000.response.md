**Reasoning:**

The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a list of periodicities for the signs.

However, the provided functions do not match the problem description. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is designed to process a list of strings where each string is either '@' or '*'.
   - It calculates a dynamic programming (DP) array to find the maximum number of '@' signs that can be collected while avoiding '*'.
   - This function is not relevant to the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on periodicities.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it for multiple test cases.
   - It extracts the number of test cases `t` and the number of signs `n` for each test case.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the path, which is a string of signs.
   - The function prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.
   - The input format and the way `func_1` is called do not align with the problem's requirement to handle periodicities of signs.

Given that the functions provided are not designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on periodicities, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
