Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it works for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Constraints Handling**:
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (1000000000 + 7) and `bx` to -1. These variables are used to track the minimum upper bound and the maximum lower bound, respectively.
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (k must be not equal to x), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.
3. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it appends 0 to the result list `r` because no integer can satisfy such constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) and subtracts the number of integers in `cx` that fall within this range.
4. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of integers that satisfy all constraints, including cases where the range is empty or where there are multiple "not equal" constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
