You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #This is printed: Each integer in the list `r` printed on a new line (where each integer represents the number of valid integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) that are not in the set `cx` for each test case)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a set of unique constraints. For each test case, it determines the number of valid integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) that are not in the set `cx`. The function then prints each result on a new line. The final state of the program is that `r` is a list of integers, each representing the number of valid integers for the corresponding test case, and the length of `r` is equal to the number of test cases `t`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It then reads `n` constraints, each consisting of two integers `a` and `x`.

2. **Constraint Types**:
   - If `a == 1`, this means `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`. The function updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`.
   - If `a == 2`, this means `k` must be less than or equal to `x`. The function updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`.
   - If `a == 3`, this means `k` must not be equal to `x`. The function adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Range Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, the function checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`.
   - If `bx >= ax`, it means there is no valid range for `k` (since `k` must be both greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`), and the function appends `0` to the result list `r`.

4. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - If `bx < ax`, the function calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` which is `ax - bx + 1`.
   - It then subtracts the number of integers in the set `cx` that fall within this range to get the final count of valid integers.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints each result in the list `r` on a new line.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization**:
  - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (`1000000000.0 + 7`), which ensures that any valid upper bound constraint will be less than this initial value.
  - `bx` is initialized to `-1`, which ensures that any valid lower bound constraint will be greater than this initial value.

- **Processing Constraints**:
  - For `a == 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`, ensuring that `k` must be at least `bx`.
  - For `a == 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`, ensuring that `k` must be at most `ax`.
  - For `a == 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx`, ensuring that `k` must not be equal to any of these values.

- **Range Check**:
  - If `bx >= ax`, it means the range is invalid, and the function correctly appends `0` to the result list.

- **Counting Valid Integers**:
  - The function correctly calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` as `ax - bx + 1`.
  - It then iterates over the set `cx` to count how many of these integers are in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts this count from the total.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. It follows the problem description and produces the expected output.

### Correctness:
**True**
