Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
import math

func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the input provided during each iteration of the loop. The value of `ap` remains unchanged. The loop prints a value for each iteration, which is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1` if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `math.ceil(y / 2)` if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, `math.ceil(x / 15)` if `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, and 0 if both `x` and `y` are 0. After all iterations, the final values of `x` and `y` depend on the last input provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `ap` from the user, which specifies the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the user. Depending on the values of `x` and `y`, it calculates and prints a value based on the following rules: if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it prints the sum of `math.ceil(y / 2)` and `math.ceil((x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4) / 15)` (if the result is positive); if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`; if `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints `math.ceil(x / 15)`; if both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0. The values of `x` and `y` are updated in each iteration, but their final state depends on the last input provided. The value of `ap` remains unchanged throughout the function.
