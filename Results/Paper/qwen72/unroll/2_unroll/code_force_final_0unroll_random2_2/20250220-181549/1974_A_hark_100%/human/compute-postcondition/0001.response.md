The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and `ap`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `ap`. If `ap` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `k` is initialized by the loop and will start at 0. The state of `x` and `y` does not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `ap` must be greater than 0; `k` is 0**
