### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of screens needed to place `x` applications with 1x1 icons and `y` applications with 2x2 icons.
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
   - A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell, and a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ap` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `y`.

3. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
     - `bxsfory` is calculated as `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which represents the minimum number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons.
     - The program then attempts to place the 1x1 icons on the remaining cells of these screens.
     - The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. This formula does not correctly account for the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
     - The correct approach should be to first place the 2x2 icons and then place the 1x1 icons on the remaining cells.
     - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells on these screens are `15 * bxsfory - 4 * y`.
     - If there are still 1x1 icons left, they should be placed on additional screens, if necessary.
     - The number of additional screens required for 1x1 icons is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - The total number of screens required is `bxsfory + math.ceil(x / 15)`.

   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:**
     - The program correctly calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons as `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:**
     - The program correctly calculates the number of screens required for 1x1 icons as `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0:**
     - The program correctly prints 0, as no screens are needed.

4. **Identifying the Error:**
   - The main error is in the formula used to update `x` in the first case. The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect.
   - The correct formula should be `x - (15 * bxsfory - 4 * y)` to calculate the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            remaining_cells = 15 * bxsfory - 4 * y
            x = max(0, x - remaining_cells)
            bxsfory1 = math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory + bxsfory1)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)

func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
  - `bxsfory` is the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.
  - `remaining_cells` is the number of cells left on these screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
  - `x` is updated to the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed, which is `max(0, x - remaining_cells)`.
  - `bxsfory1` is the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.
  - The total number of screens required is `bxsfory + bxsfory1`.

- The other cases remain the same and are correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
