The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is expected to operate with `x` and `y` as non-negative integers where 0 <= x, y <= 99. Since the output is not specified, it is unclear what the function returns. 

Given the constraints and the lack of information about the output, the functionality of the function `func_1` cannot be fully described. If you can provide more details about the output, I can refine the description.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but is expected to operate with `x` and `y` as non-negative integers where 0 <= x, y <= 99. The specific return value is not provided.**
