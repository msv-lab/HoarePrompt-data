Output State: **For each test case, the variable `c` will hold the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets, and `k` will be 0 (indicating all tickets have been bought). The variables `n`, `m`, and the list `l` will retain their initial values, and `t` will be equal to the total number of tickets bought, which is `k` from the initial state.**
