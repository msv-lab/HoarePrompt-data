Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the ticket prices and then purchasing the cheapest tickets first, up to the daily limit `m`. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The program does not account for the price increase that occurs after tickets are purchased on a given day. This means that the prices in the list `l` should be adjusted after each purchase, but the program does not do this. Instead, it simply adds the number of tickets purchased to a variable `t` and continues to use the original prices, which can lead to incorrect results.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be purchased exceeds the daily limit `m` for multiple days, and the price increases are not applied correctly.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Sort the ticket prices.
2. Purchase the cheapest tickets first, up to the daily limit `m`.
3. Adjust the prices for subsequent days based on the number of tickets purchased.
4. Continue this process until all `k` tickets are bought.

Given the current implementation, the program will not correctly calculate the minimum spending required to purchase `k` tickets due to the missing price adjustment logic.

Correctness: **False**
