Output State: **The function `func` is defined with parameters `a` and `k`, where `a` is a list of integers of length `2n` containing each integer from 1 to `n` exactly twice, and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\). Additionally, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). `t` is an input integer.**
