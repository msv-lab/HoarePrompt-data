The only objects in the loop head are the variables `q` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `q` is 0 and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`q` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
