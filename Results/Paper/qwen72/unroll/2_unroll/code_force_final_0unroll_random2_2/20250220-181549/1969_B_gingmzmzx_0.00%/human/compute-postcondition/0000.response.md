Output State: **The function should take a binary string `s` as input, where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `s` consists only of '0' and '1'. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided in the input, and the sum of the lengths of all strings across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer.**
