Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the string is already sorted. According to the problem description, if the string is already sorted, the output should be 0. However, the given program does not account for this scenario and will still calculate a non-zero cost.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
0000
```
The string "0000" is already sorted, so the expected output is 0. However, the program will output a non-zero value, which is incorrect.
