### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers. This is correct because the problem specifies that the input string consists only of '0' and '1'.

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The variable `zeroes` is used to count the number of '0's in the string `s`. This is necessary because the cost of cyclic shifts depends on the number of '0's and '1's in the string.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The function initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the count of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is '0', it increments `cnt[0]` and adds 1 to `ans` if there is at least one '1' before it (`cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is '1', it increments `cnt[1]` and adds the difference between the total number of '0's and the number of '0's encountered so far (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing each string, the function prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum total cost to sort the string.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" in the example), as the cost will be 0.
   - The function also handles the case where the string is not sorted and requires multiple operations to sort it (e.g., "101011" in the example).

6. **Complexity:**
   - The function processes each string in linear time, which is efficient given the constraints (sum of lengths of strings does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The approach and the calculations are consistent with the problem description and the provided examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
