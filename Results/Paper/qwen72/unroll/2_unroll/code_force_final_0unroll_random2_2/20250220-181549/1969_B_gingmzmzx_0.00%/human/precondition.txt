The function `main` does not take any input parameters. However, it is expected to read input from stdin where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a binary string s (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5) consisting of only 0s and 1s. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
