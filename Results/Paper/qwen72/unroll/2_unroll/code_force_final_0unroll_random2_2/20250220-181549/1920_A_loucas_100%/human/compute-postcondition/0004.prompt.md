You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and no two constraints are the same.
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `loop` times, and for each iteration, it processes `innerLoop` constraints. The variables `less`, `big`, and `no` are reset to empty lists at the start of each iteration. The variable `num` is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1` for each iteration, and if `num` is less than 1, it prints 0 and continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it decrements `num` for each value in `no` that is between `max(big)` and `min(less)` (inclusive), and then prints the final value of `num`. The state of `t`, `n`, and the constraints for each test case remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a set of test cases, each with a number of unique constraints represented by pairs (a, x). It returns a result for each test case based on these constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
