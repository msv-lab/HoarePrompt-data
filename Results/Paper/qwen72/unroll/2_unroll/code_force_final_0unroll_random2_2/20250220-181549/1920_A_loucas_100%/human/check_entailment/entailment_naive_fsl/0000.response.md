Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles the constraints as described in the problem statement. It processes each test case by collecting the constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), `less` for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), and `no` for constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to x). It then calculates the range of possible values for k by finding the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`, and computes the number of integers within this range. If the range is invalid (i.e., the minimum value in `less` is less than the maximum value in `big`), it correctly prints 0. Finally, it subtracts the number of values in `no` that fall within the valid range, ensuring that these values are not counted. This approach correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description.
