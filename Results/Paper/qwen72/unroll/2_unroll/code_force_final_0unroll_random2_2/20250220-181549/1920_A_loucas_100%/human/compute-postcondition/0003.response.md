The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on a set of test cases, each containing a number of constraints. Each test case is defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair of integers (a, x) where `a` is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and no two constraints are the same.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the constraints provided. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes a set of test cases, each with a number of unique constraints represented by pairs (a, x). It returns a result for each test case based on these constraints.**
