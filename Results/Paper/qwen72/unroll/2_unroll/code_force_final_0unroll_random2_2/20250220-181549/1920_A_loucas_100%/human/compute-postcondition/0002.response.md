Output State: **The loop iterates `loop` times, and for each iteration, it processes `innerLoop` constraints. The variables `less`, `big`, and `no` are reset to empty lists at the start of each iteration. The variable `num` is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1` for each iteration, and if `num` is less than 1, it prints 0 and continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it decrements `num` for each value in `no` that is between `max(big)` and `min(less)` (inclusive), and then prints the final value of `num`. The state of `t`, `n`, and the constraints for each test case remain unchanged.**
