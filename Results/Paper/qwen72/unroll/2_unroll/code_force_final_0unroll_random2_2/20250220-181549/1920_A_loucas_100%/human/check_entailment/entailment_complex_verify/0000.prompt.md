You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: The loop iterates `loop` times, and for each iteration, it processes `innerLoop` constraints. The variables `less`, `big`, and `no` are reset to empty lists at the start of each iteration. The variable `num` is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1` for each iteration, and if `num` is less than 1, it prints 0 and continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it decrements `num` for each value in `no` that is between `max(big)` and `min(less)` (inclusive), and then prints the final value of `num`. The state of `t`, `n`, and the constraints for each test case remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. For each test case, it reads the constraints and categorizes them into three lists: `big` for constraints where `x == 1`, `less` for constraints where `x == 2`, and `no` for constraints where `x == 3`. It then calculates the number of integers that are greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big` and less than or equal to the minimum value in `less`. If this number is less than 1, it prints 0. Otherwise, it subtracts the count of values in `no` that fall within this range and prints the final result. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The state of the input variables `t`, `n`, and the constraints for each test case remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles the constraints as described in the problem statement. It processes each test case by collecting the constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), `less` for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), and `no` for constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to x). It then calculates the range of possible values for k by finding the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`, and computes the number of integers within this range. If the range is invalid (i.e., the minimum value in `less` is less than the maximum value in `big`), it correctly prints 0. Finally, it subtracts the number of values in `no` that fall within the valid range, ensuring that these values are not counted. This approach correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description.
