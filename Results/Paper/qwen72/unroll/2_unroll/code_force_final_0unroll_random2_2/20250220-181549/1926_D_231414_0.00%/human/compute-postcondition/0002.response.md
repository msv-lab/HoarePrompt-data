The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `times`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t`, `n`, `a_1, ..., a_n`, and `check` do not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `times` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
