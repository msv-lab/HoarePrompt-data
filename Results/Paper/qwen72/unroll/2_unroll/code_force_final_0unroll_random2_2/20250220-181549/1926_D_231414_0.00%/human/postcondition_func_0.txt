The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `data`. It then processes `data` to count and print the number of unique integers after each iteration, where an integer is considered unique if it does not have a pair that results in a specific XOR value with `2^31 - 1`. The function does not return any value but prints the count of unique integers for each test case. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, and `data` contains integers within the range 0 to 2^31 - 1. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
