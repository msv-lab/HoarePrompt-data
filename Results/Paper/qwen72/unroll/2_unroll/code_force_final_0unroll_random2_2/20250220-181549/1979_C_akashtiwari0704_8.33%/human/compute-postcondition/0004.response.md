Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `bets` (1 ≤ bets ≤ 50) and a list of integers `a` (2 ≤ a[i] ≤ 20). For each test case, it calculates a list of bets such that the sum of the calculated bets is less than the product of the elements in `a`. If such a distribution is possible, it prints the list of calculated bets; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `T`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, `ans`, and `bets` will reflect the state of the last test case processed. **
