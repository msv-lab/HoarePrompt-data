You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        prod = 1
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        sumo = 0
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `bets` (1 ≤ bets ≤ 50) and a list of integers `a` (2 ≤ a[i] ≤ 20). For each test case, it calculates a list of bets such that the sum of the calculated bets is less than the product of the elements in `a`. If such a distribution is possible, it prints the list of calculated bets; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `T`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, `ans`, and `bets` will reflect the state of the last test case processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - This product is used to ensure that the bets are distributed in such a way that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the product.

3. **Bet Calculation**:
   - For each outcome, the function calculates the bet as `prod // a[i]`.
   - This ensures that if the i-th outcome is the winning one, the return is `a[i] * (prod // a[i]) = prod`, which is the same for all outcomes.

4. **Sum of Bets**:
   - The function sums up all the calculated bets `sumo`.
   - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1` indicating that there is no valid distribution of bets.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The idea of using the product of all multipliers to distribute the bets is a common strategy to ensure that the return for any winning outcome is the same and equal to the product.
  - However, the condition `sumo < prod` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. This is the key requirement of the problem.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If all multipliers are the same, the sum of bets `sumo` will be `bets * (prod // a[0])`. For example, if `a = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`, then `prod = 5^5 = 3125` and `sumo = 5 * (3125 // 5) = 3125`. In this case, `sumo` is equal to `prod`, and the function correctly prints `-1`.

- **General Case**:
  - For most cases, the product of the multipliers will be much larger than the sum of the bets, ensuring that `sumo < prod`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the bets in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. It handles edge cases where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1`.

### Correctness:
**True**
