#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of integers `k` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The function should return a list of integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) representing the bets on each outcome, or -1 if no such distribution is possible. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = 1
        
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The variable `T` will have the value `t-1` after the loop finishes all iterations. The list `a` will contain the calculated bets for the last test case, or -1 if no valid distribution is possible. The variable `prod` will hold the product of the multipliers for the last test case. The variable `sumo` will hold the sum of the calculated bets for the last test case. The variable `ans` will contain the string representation of the bets for the last test case, or an empty string if the last test case resulted in -1. The variable `bets` will hold the number of outcomes for the last test case. The variable `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `bets` (1 ≤ bets ≤ 50) and a list of integers `a` (2 ≤ a[i] ≤ 20). For each test case, it calculates a list of bets such that the sum of the calculated bets is less than the product of the elements in `a`. If such a distribution is possible, it prints the list of calculated bets; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `T`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, `ans`, and `bets` will reflect the state of the last test case processed.
