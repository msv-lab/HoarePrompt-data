You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of integers `k` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The function should return a list of integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) representing the bets on each outcome, or -1 if no such distribution is possible. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = 1
        
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The variable `T` will have the value `t-1` after the loop finishes all iterations. The list `a` will contain the calculated bets for the last test case, or -1 if no valid distribution is possible. The variable `prod` will hold the product of the multipliers for the last test case. The variable `sumo` will hold the sum of the calculated bets for the last test case. The variable `ans` will contain the string representation of the bets for the last test case, or an empty string if the last test case resulted in -1. The variable `bets` will hold the number of outcomes for the last test case. The variable `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `k` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20). It returns a list of integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) representing the bets on each outcome for each test case, or -1 if no such distribution is possible.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
