### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x` and processes it.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The program initializes an array `s` to store the binary representation of `x` using 30 bits (since \(1 \le x < 2^{30}\)).
   - It iterates through the bits of `x` from 0 to 29 and appends '1' to `s` if the bit is set, otherwise '0'.

3. **Adjusting the Representation**:
   - The program then iterates through the array `s` to adjust the values to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - It uses a flag to keep track of whether a carry needs to be propagated.
   - If a '1' is followed by another '1', the first '1' is changed to '-1', and the flag is set to 1 to indicate a carry.
   - If a carry is set and the current bit is '0', the current bit is changed to '1' and the flag is reset to 0.
   - If a carry is set and the current bit is '1', the current bit is changed to '0' and the flag remains set to 1.
   - After the loop, if the flag is still set and the last bit is '0', it changes the last bit to '1'.
   - If the flag is still set and the last bit is '1', it changes the last bit to '0' and appends '1' to the array, increasing the length by 1.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - The program makes a final pass through the array to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist by adjusting any '1' followed by '-1' to '0' and '-1' respectively.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the array `s` and the elements of the array `s`.

### Analysis:

- **Binary Representation**:
  - The initial binary representation is correctly generated using bitwise operations.
  - The length of the array is set to 30, which is appropriate for the given range of `x`.

- **Adjusting the Representation**:
  - The program correctly identifies and adjusts consecutive '1's to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
  - The carry propagation logic is implemented correctly, ensuring that the final array meets the required conditions.

- **Final Adjustments**:
  - The final pass through the array to adjust any '1' followed by '-1' is necessary to ensure the array meets the problem constraints.

- **Output**:
  - The program correctly outputs the length of the array and the array itself.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly solve the problem by generating a valid array `a` that meets all the given constraints. The logic for handling consecutive non-zero elements and carry propagation is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
