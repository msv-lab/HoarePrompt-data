You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 30
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')
        flag = 0
        for i in range(0, 29):
            if flag and s[i] == '0':
                s[i] = '1'
                flag = 0
            if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):
                s[i] = '-1'
                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = '0'
            else:
                pass
        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        print(length)
        print(*s)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (1 ≤ x < 2^30) and converts it to a binary string representation. It then modifies this binary string according to specific rules: it changes certain '1's to '-1's and '0's to '1's, and potentially extends the length of the binary string by one. After processing, it prints the length of the modified binary string and the modified binary digits. The function does not return any value, and the final state of `x` is not preserved. The list `s` contains the modified binary representation of the last input `x` after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x` and processes it.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The program initializes an array `s` to store the binary representation of `x` using 30 bits (since \(1 \le x < 2^{30}\)).
   - It iterates through the bits of `x` from 0 to 29 and appends '1' to `s` if the bit is set, otherwise '0'.

3. **Adjusting the Representation**:
   - The program then iterates through the array `s` to adjust the values to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - It uses a flag to keep track of whether a carry needs to be propagated.
   - If a '1' is followed by another '1', the first '1' is changed to '-1', and the flag is set to 1 to indicate a carry.
   - If a carry is set and the current bit is '0', the current bit is changed to '1' and the flag is reset to 0.
   - If a carry is set and the current bit is '1', the current bit is changed to '0' and the flag remains set to 1.
   - After the loop, if the flag is still set and the last bit is '0', it changes the last bit to '1'.
   - If the flag is still set and the last bit is '1', it changes the last bit to '0' and appends '1' to the array, increasing the length by 1.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - The program makes a final pass through the array to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist by adjusting any '1' followed by '-1' to '0' and '-1' respectively.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the array `s` and the elements of the array `s`.

### Analysis:

- **Binary Representation**:
  - The initial binary representation is correctly generated using bitwise operations.
  - The length of the array is set to 30, which is appropriate for the given range of `x`.

- **Adjusting the Representation**:
  - The program correctly identifies and adjusts consecutive '1's to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
  - The carry propagation logic is implemented correctly, ensuring that the final array meets the required conditions.

- **Final Adjustments**:
  - The final pass through the array to adjust any '1' followed by '-1' is necessary to ensure the array meets the problem constraints.

- **Output**:
  - The program correctly outputs the length of the array and the array itself.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly solve the problem by generating a valid array `a` that meets all the given constraints. The logic for handling consecutive non-zero elements and carry propagation is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
