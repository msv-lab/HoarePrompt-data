The function `func` does not appear to accept any parameters based on the provided function definition. However, the output is expected to be related to a positive integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x < 2^30. Since the function definition does not include any parameters, it's unclear how `x` is provided or used within the function. Assuming `x` is somehow defined or used internally within the function, the output should be based on the value of `x`.

Given the lack of explicit parameters and the provided output constraints, I will describe the functionality based on the assumption that `x` is used internally:

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on an internal positive integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x < 2^30.**
