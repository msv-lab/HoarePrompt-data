### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x` and initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The function generates the binary representation of `x` by checking each bit from 0 to 29 (since \(1 \le x < 2^{30}\)).
   - If the bit is set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true), it appends '1' to `s`. Otherwise, it appends '0'.

3. **Modifying the Binary Representation:**
   - The function then iterates through the binary representation to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero values exist.
   - It uses a flag to track whether a '1' needs to be adjusted to '-1' and subsequent '0's to '1's.
   - If a '1' is found and the next bit is also '1', the current bit is set to '-1' and the flag is set to 1.
   - If the flag is set and the current bit is '0', the current bit is set to '1' and the flag is reset to 0.
   - If the flag is set at the end of the loop and the last bit is '0', it sets the last bit to '1'.
   - If the flag is set and the last bit is '1', it sets the last bit to '0' and appends an additional '1' to the list, increasing the length by 1.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - The function makes a final pass to ensure that no '1' followed by '-1' exists. If such a pair is found, it adjusts the '1' to '-1' and the '-1' to '0'.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the length of the modified binary representation.
   - It then prints the modified binary representation.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the binary representation and the required modifications to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero values exist.
- The final adjustments ensure that the binary representation is valid according to the problem constraints.
- The function prints the correct output format for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and produces the expected output for the given examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
