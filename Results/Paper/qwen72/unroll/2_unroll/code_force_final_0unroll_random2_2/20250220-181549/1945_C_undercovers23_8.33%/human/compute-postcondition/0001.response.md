The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be an integer greater than 0. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The state of `t` must be set to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`t` must be an integer greater than 0**
