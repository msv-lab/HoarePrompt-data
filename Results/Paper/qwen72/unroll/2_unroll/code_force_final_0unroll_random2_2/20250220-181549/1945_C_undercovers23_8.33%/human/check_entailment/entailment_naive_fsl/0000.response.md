Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the road should be laid before the first house or after the last house. Specifically, the program only considers positions where the road is laid between two houses, but it does not handle the edge cases where the road is laid before the first house (i.e., output 0) or after the last house (i.e., output n). For example, if the input is:

```
1
3
000
```

The correct output should be `0` because all residents want to live on the left side, and laying the road before the first house satisfies the condition. However, the program does not correctly handle this case and will not output `0` as expected.
