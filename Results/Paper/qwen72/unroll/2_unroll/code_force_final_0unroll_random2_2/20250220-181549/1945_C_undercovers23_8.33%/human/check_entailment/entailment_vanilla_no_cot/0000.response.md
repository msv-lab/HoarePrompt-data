Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Percentages:**
   - The program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` as percentages, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect comparisons. The problem only requires that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, not that the percentage is at least 50%.
   - The correct condition should be:
     - For the left side: `zero >= (i + 1) // 2`
     - For the right side: `o - one >= (n - i - 1) // 2`

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the edge cases where the road should be laid before the first house or after the last house.
   - Specifically, the program should check if laying the road before the first house (i.e., `i = 0`) or after the last house (i.e., `i = n`) satisfies the conditions.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a list `lst` to store all valid positions and then finds the minimum distance to the middle. This is inefficient and can be simplified by keeping track of the best position directly.

4. **Output for No Valid Positions:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if no valid positions are found, it should check the overall percentage of ones and zeros. This is not necessary because the problem guarantees that an answer always exists.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        # Count the total number of zeros and ones
        o = s.count('1')
        z = s.count('0')
        
        # Initialize the counts for the left side
        zero = 0
        one = 0
        
        # Initialize the best position and the minimum distance to the middle
        best_pos = 0
        min_dist = float('inf')
        
        # Check all possible positions for the road
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            
            # Calculate the number of zeros and ones on the right side
            right_zeros = z - zero
            right_ones = o - one
            
            # Check the conditions for the left and right sides
            if zero >= (i + 1) // 2 and right_ones >= (n - i - 1) // 2:
                # Calculate the distance to the middle
                dist = abs(n // 2 - i)
                # Update the best position if this one is closer to the middle
                if dist < min_dist:
                    min_dist = dist
                    best_pos = i
        
        # Output the best position
        print(best_pos)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Counting Zeros and Ones:**
  - We count the total number of zeros and ones in the string `s` to use for the right side calculations.
- **Iterating Through Possible Positions:**
  - We iterate through each possible position `i` for the road.
  - For each position, we update the counts of zeros and ones on the left side.
  - We calculate the counts of zeros and ones on the right side.
- **Checking Conditions:**
  - We check if the number of zeros on the left side is at least half of the left side and if the number of ones on the right side is at least half of the right side.
- **Updating Best Position:**
  - If the conditions are met, we calculate the distance to the middle and update the best position if this one is closer.
- **Output:**
  - Finally, we output the best position found.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem.
