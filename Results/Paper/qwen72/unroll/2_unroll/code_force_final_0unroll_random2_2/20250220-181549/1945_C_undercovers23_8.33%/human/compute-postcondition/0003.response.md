The function `func` accepts no parameters. It reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case is described by two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and the second line contains a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The function processes each test case and returns the results for each test case. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` with characters '0' or '1'. It processes each test case and returns the results for each test case.**
