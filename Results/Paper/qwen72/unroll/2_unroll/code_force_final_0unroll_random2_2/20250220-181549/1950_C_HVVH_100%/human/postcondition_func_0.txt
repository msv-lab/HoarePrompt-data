The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, representing the number of time entries. For each of the `n` entries, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm" from the user input, converts it to a 12-hour format, and appends 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour. The function prints each converted time followed by 'AM' or 'PM'. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the value of `day` will be 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the last time input in the loop.
