To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to check the conditions in the loop head:

1. `left <= right`
2. `right < len(s)`
3. `left < len(s)`

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `s` is a list containing the same elements as `sChar`, in the same order.
- `left` is 0.
- `cost` is 0.
- `right` is 1.

Let's analyze each condition:
1. `left <= right`:
   - `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, so `left <= right` is true.
2. `right < len(s)`:
   - `right` is 1, so for this condition to be true, `len(s)` must be greater than 1.
3. `left < len(s)`:
   - `left` is 0, so for this condition to be true, `len(s)` must be greater than 0.

Since `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, the conditions `left <= right` and `left < len(s)` are already satisfied. The only condition that needs to be ensured is `right < len(s)`, which requires `len(s)` to be greater than 1.

Therefore, the modified state to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed is:
State: **`s` is a list containing the same elements as `sChar`, in the same order, and `len(s)` must be greater than 1, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1**
