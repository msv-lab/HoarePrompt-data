The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `sChar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `sChar`. If `sChar` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute. Given that `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2, the loop will definitely execute at least once. However, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect the first character of `sChar` before the loop starts.

State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is the first character of `sChar`, `s` is an empty list**
