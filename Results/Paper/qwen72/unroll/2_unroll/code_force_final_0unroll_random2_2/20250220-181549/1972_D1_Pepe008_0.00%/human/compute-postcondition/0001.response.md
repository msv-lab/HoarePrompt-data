The only objects in the loop head are the variable `t` and the input integer `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is initialized to 0 by the `range(T)` function.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0**
