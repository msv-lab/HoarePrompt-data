Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect. The function should be defined as `def func(n, m):` to match the problem description.
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `m` from the input. This part is correct.

2. **Loop and Calculation**:
   - The program uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of `i` and `j`. However, the inner loop starts from `4` instead of `1`, which is incorrect because the problem description requires `1 ≤ b ≤ m`.
   - The condition `if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:` is intended to check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the variables `i` and `j` are not correctly used in the context of the problem. The loop should iterate over `a` and `b` as specified in the problem.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and adds it to `suma` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`. This formula does not align with the problem's requirement to check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The final result is printed as `suma - 1`, which is also incorrect. The correct approach should count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given condition.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each pair `(a, b)`, the program should iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The correct logic would involve a nested loop where the outer loop iterates over `a` and the inner loop iterates over `b`, and a counter is incremented for each valid pair.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
