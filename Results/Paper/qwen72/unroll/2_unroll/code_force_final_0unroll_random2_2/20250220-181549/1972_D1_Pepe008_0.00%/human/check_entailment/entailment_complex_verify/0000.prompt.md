You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)



- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(n, m):` where `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 × 10^6.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()

                for j in range(4,b+1):
                    if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:
                        print(i,j)"""
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        
        print(suma - 1)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `T` times, reading pairs of integers `(a, b)` from the input. For each pair, it calculates the sum of the number of valid `i` values that satisfy the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a pair of integers `(a, b)` from the input. It then calculates a value based on these integers and prints the result, which is the sum of the number of valid `i` values that satisfy the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Specifically, the loop `for j in range(4, b + 1):` in the commented-out section starts from 4, which is incorrect because \(b\) can be as small as 1. Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs is flawed. For example, when \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\), the correct output should be 3 (pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2)), but the program will produce an incorrect result. The logic for calculating `x` and the final `suma` does not correctly account for all valid pairs.
