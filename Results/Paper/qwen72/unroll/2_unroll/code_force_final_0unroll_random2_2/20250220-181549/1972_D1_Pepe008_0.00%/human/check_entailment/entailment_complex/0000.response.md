Reasoning:

The program provided is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` is defined without parameters, but according to the problem description, it should take two parameters `n` and `m`. The correct function definition should be `def func(n, m):`.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case. However, it should read `n` and `m` for each test case, not `a` and `b`.

3. **Condition Check**: The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` but uses an incorrect formula. The condition specified in the problem is that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The program's logic does not correctly implement this condition.

4. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and then adds `x` to `suma`. This formula does not match the problem's requirement. The correct approach would involve checking if `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)` for each pair `(a, b)`.

5. **Output Adjustment**: The program prints `suma - 1` at the end of each test case, which is incorrect. The output should be the total number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each test case.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
