Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. The lambda function `r` is defined and can be used to read multiple integers from a single input line.**
