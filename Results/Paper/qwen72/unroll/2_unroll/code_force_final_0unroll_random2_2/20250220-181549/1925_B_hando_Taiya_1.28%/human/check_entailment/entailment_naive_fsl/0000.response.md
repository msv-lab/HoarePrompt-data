Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where `n` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1, the maximum balance should be `x` itself, because the GCD of a single number with itself is the number itself. However, the current implementation of the program does not account for this edge case.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
10 1
```
The expected output is `10`, but the program will output `0` because the loop does not consider the case where `n` is 1. The loop starts from `i = 1` and checks if `n <= x // i`, but since `n` is 1, the condition `n <= x // i` is always true for `i` in the range, and the program will print `0` instead of `10`.

To fix this, the program should handle the case where `n` is 1 separately, like this:
```python
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 1:
        print(x)
        return
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```
