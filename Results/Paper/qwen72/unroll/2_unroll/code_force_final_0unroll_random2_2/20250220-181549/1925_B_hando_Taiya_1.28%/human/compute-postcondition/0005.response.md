The function `func_1` does not have any parameters listed in the provided function definition. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships provided, it seems there should be parameters `t`, `x`, and `n`. 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so I cannot accurately describe the return value. However, I can describe the parameters the function is expected to accept.

Functionality: **The function is expected to accept three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. The return value is not specified.**
