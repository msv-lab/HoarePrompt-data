Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum balance of a problemset, where the balance is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems, and the sum of the difficulties equals `x`.

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the values of `x` and `n` from the input.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)` from the `math` module).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Why it Works:
- The program leverages the fact that the GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems will be maximized if the difficulties are as evenly distributed as possible.
- By iterating over the divisors of `x`, the program ensures that it considers all possible ways to divide `x` into `n` sub-problems.
- The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that the number of sub-problems `n` can be formed with the given divisor `i` or its corresponding quotient `x // i`.

### Example Walkthrough:
- For `x = 10` and `n = 3`:
  - Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.
  - The program checks:
    - `i = 1`: `n <= 10 // 1` (True), `ans = max(0, 1) = 1`.
    - `i = 2`: `n <= 10 // 2` (True), `ans = max(1, 2) = 2`.
    - `i = 5`: `n <= 5` (False), `ans` remains 2.
    - `i = 10`: `n <= 10` (False), `ans` remains 2.
  - The maximum balance is 2, which is correct.

- For `x = 5` and `n = 5`:
  - Divisors of 5 are 1, 5.
  - The program checks:
    - `i = 1`: `n <= 5 // 1` (True), `ans = max(0, 1) = 1`.
    - `i = 5`: `n <= 5` (True), `ans = max(1, 1) = 1`.
  - The maximum balance is 1, which is correct.

- For `x = 420` and `n = 69`:
  - Divisors of 420 include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420.
  - The program checks:
    - `i = 6`: `n <= 420 // 6` (True), `ans = max(0, 6) = 6`.
    - The maximum balance is 6, which is correct.

Thus, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
