### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums to `x`. The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems. To achieve the maximum balance, we need to find the largest integer `d` such that `d` divides `x` and `x // d` is at least `n`.

The provided program follows this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `tc`.
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
3. Inside `func_1`, it reads `x` and `n`.
4. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
5. It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x` (using `isqrt`).
6. For each divisor `i`:
   - If `i` divides `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`):
     - It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
7. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Divisors of `x`**: The program correctly identifies all divisors of `x` by iterating up to the square root of `x` and checking both `i` and `x // i`.
- **Conditions for `n`**: The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` are used to ensure that the number of sub-problems `n` can be formed with the given divisor.
- **Maximum GCD**: The program updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and the valid divisors, which ensures that the largest possible GCD is found.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Test Case**: The program handles a single test case correctly.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` in a loop.
- **Edge Values**: The program correctly handles edge values such as `x = 1` and `n = 1` (where the only possible GCD is 1).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the problemset. It efficiently checks all divisors and updates the maximum balance accordingly. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
