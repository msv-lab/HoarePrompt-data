The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the integer `2` (the range). The loop will execute 2 times regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or the state of `a` because the range is fixed at 2. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the variables `t`, `n`, or `a` for the loop to execute. The state of `_` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be set by the loop itself.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list**
