You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each test case, the grid is a 2 \times n matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing two input values.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing two input values, `s` is the concatenated string of `a[0]` and `a[1][n-1]` if no condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, otherwise `s` is the concatenated string of `a[0][:i + 1]` and `a[1][i:]` where `i` is the first index that meets the condition, `x` is `n-1` if no condition is met, otherwise `x` is the first index `i` that meets the condition.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `t` is `x - i + 1` where `i` is the first index that meets the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`, or `t` remains 1 if no such condition is met. `n`, `a`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the value of the string s)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is 1 if no index i meets the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`, or t is `x - i + 1` if the condition is met at the first such index i)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and a 2 \times n matrix `grid` where each element is either 0 or 1. It returns a result based on the input parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
