The function `func_1` does not have any parameters explicitly listed in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it seems that the function should accept parameters `t` and `n`, and a grid. Here's the step-by-step thinking:

1. **Parameters**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
   - `grid` is a 2 \times n matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.

2. **Output**:
   - The function returns a result based on the input parameters `t`, `n`, and `grid`.

Given the constraints and the typical behavior of such functions, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and a 2 \times n matrix `grid` where each element is either 0 or 1. It returns a result based on the input parameters.**
