Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input string `s` which is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.
2. **Balance Calculation**: It initializes a variable `balance` to 0 and iterates through each character in the string `s`. For each character, it updates the balance:
   - If the character is '(', it increments the balance.
   - If the character is ')', it decrements the balance.
3. **Details Collection**: It collects the balance, negative position, and character in a list `details`. The negative position is used to break ties in the sort operation by ensuring that characters with the same balance are sorted in decreasing order of their original positions.
4. **Sorting**: The list `details` is sorted based on the balance and then by the negative position. This ensures that the columns are sorted in increasing order of prefix balance and in decreasing order of position for ties.
5. **Result Construction**: The program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list.
6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the result string.

The program follows the problem description accurately and will produce the correct balanced shuffle for any valid input.
