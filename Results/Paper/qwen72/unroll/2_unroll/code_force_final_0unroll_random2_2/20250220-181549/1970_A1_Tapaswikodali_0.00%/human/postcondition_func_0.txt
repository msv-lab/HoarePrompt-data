The function reads a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses with a maximum length of 500,000. It processes the string to create a list of tuples containing the current balance, the negative index, and the character at each position. After sorting this list, it constructs a new string from the characters in the sorted list and prints this new string. The function does not return any value.
