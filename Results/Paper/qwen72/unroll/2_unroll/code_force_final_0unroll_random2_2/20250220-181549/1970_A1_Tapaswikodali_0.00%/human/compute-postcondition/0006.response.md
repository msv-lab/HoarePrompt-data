Output State: **`s` is the same non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `balance` is 0. `details` is a sorted list containing tuples, each with the current balance, the negative index, and the character at that index, for every character in the string `s`, sorted by the current balance in ascending order. `result` is a string that is the same as `s`.** 

The code snippet constructs a string `result` by joining the characters from the `details` list, which are the same characters as in `s`. Since `details` contains all the characters from `s` in the same order, `result` ends up being identical to `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
