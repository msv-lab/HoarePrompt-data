Output State: **The loop reads a number of test cases from the input, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and calculates the number of integers that appear more than once. This count is printed for each test case. After all iterations of the loop, the variables `input`, `n`, `a`, `cnt`, and `ans` will have been updated and used for each test case, but their final values will be the ones from the last test case processed. The loop itself does not modify the initial state outside of its scope.**
