### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and increments the count for each integer.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Points**:
   - The program initializes a variable `ans` to store the maximum number of points you can get.
   - It iterates through the `cnt` list and for each integer `x`, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans`. This calculation is based on the fact that if an integer appears more than once in your hand, you can score a point for each additional occurrence after the first one.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - The program assumes that Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. However, the program only focuses on your hand and calculates the maximum points you can get by playing optimally.
   - The logic `max(0, x - 1)` ensures that you only score points for the second occurrence of each integer in your hand, which aligns with the game rules.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated maximum points for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
- The counting and point calculation logic is correct based on the problem description.
- The program does not explicitly simulate the turns of the game, but it correctly calculates the maximum points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
