You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, where each integer from 1 to n appears at most 2 times in the list a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        
        ans = 0
        
        for x in cnt:
            ans += max(0, x - 1)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop reads a number of test cases from the input, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and calculates the number of integers that appear more than once. This count is printed for each test case. After all iterations of the loop, the variables `input`, `n`, `a`, `cnt`, and `ans` will have been updated and used for each test case, but their final values will be the ones from the last test case processed. The loop itself does not modify the initial state outside of its scope.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. Each integer in `a` ranges from 1 to `n` and appears at most twice. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
