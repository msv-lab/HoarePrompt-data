You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                (a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            (a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
    print()
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads two strings of digits from the user, `a` and `b`, and modifies them such that for the first position where the digits differ, if the digit in `a` is less than the digit in `b`, they are swapped. After the first swap or if the digit in `a` is greater than the digit in `b` at any point, no further swaps occur. The function then prints the modified `a` and `b` strings, each on a new line, followed by a blank line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly maximize the product of \(x\) and \(y\) for every potential case. Specifically, the logic in the function `func_1` only swaps the digits once when it finds the first pair of digits where \(a[i] < b[i]\). This approach does not guarantee that the product of \(x\) and \(y\) is maximized.

For example, consider the input:
```
x = 3516
y = 3982
```
The expected output should be:
```
3912
3586
```
However, the program will output:
```
3586
3912
```
This is because the program only swaps the digits at the first position where \(a[i] < b[i]\), which is at index 1 (3 and 9). After this swap, the program does not consider further swaps that could potentially maximize the product.

To correctly maximize the product, the program should consider all possible swaps that can increase the product, not just the first one.
