#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, x and y, which are strings of digits from 1 to 9, and both strings are of the same length. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: The lists `a` and `b` are modified such that for the first position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ, if `a[i]` was less than `b[i]`, they are swapped. After the first swap or if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]` at any point, no further swaps occur. The variable `f` will be 1 if a swap has occurred or if `a[i]` was greater than `b[i]` at any point, otherwise, it remains 0.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: `a = [2, 3, 5, 7]`, `b = [1, 3, 4, 8]`, `f = 1`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: a = [2, 3, 5, 7], b = [1, 3, 4, 8], f = 1.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads two strings of digits from the user, `a` and `b`, and modifies them such that for the first position where the digits differ, if the digit in `a` is less than the digit in `b`, they are swapped. After the first swap or if the digit in `a` is greater than the digit in `b` at any point, no further swaps occur. The function then prints the modified `a` and `b` strings, each on a new line, followed by a blank line.
