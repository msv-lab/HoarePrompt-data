The code `M += [w]` appends the integer value of `w` to the list `M`. The initial state specifies that `q` and `x` are integers with 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, `M` is an empty list, `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer, and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. After appending `w` to `M`, the list `M` is no longer empty and contains the integer `w`.

Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, `M` is a list containing the integer `w`, `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer, and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
