Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific case where the program fails is when Alice and Bob are in positions that allow Alice to win in an optimal move, but the program incorrectly determines the outcome. For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4 4 1 1 3 2
```

Expected Output:
```
Alice
```

Actual Output:
```
Draw
```

In this case, Alice can move to (2, 2) on her first turn, and Bob cannot move to (2, 2) on his turn because he is already at (3, 2). Therefore, Alice wins. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" for this test case. This indicates that the logic for determining the outcome of the game is flawed, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
