### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` and assigns them to variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.

2. **Initial Draw Check**:
   - The program checks if `x2 <= x1`. If this condition is true, it prints "draw" and returns. This is correct because if Bob's chip is already in or above Alice's row, neither can win since they cannot move into each other's row.

3. **Odd Difference Check**:
   - If the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, the program checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Alice" and returns. This is correct because if the difference in rows is odd and the columns are the same, Alice can move directly to Bob's position on her next turn.
   - If `y1` is not equal to `y2`, the program adjusts `y1` and `x1` to simulate Alice's move. It then checks if `y1 == y2` again. If true, it prints "Alice" and returns. This is correct because Alice can move diagonally to match Bob's column.
   - If `y1` is still not equal to `y2`, the program calculates the number of moves `a` and the remaining distance `b` and `t`. It then checks if the conditions for Alice to win are met. If not, it prints "draw" and returns. This is correct because it ensures Alice cannot force a win under the given conditions.

4. **Even Difference Check**:
   - If the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, the program checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "bob" and returns. This is correct because if the difference in rows is even and the columns are the same, Bob can move directly to Alice's position on his next turn.
   - If `y1` is not equal to `y2`, the program adjusts `y1` and `x1` to simulate Bob's move. It then checks if the conditions for Bob to win are met. If not, it prints "draw" and returns. This is correct because it ensures Bob cannot force a win under the given conditions.

5. **General Flow**:
   - The program correctly handles the logic for both players and checks the conditions for a win or a draw.
   - The program does not return any value from the function, which is not necessary since the output is printed directly.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given rules and constraints. It handles all the edge cases and ensures that the correct output is printed for each test case.
