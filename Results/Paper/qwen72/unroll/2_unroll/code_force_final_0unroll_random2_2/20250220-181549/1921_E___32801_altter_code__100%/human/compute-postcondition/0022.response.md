Postcondition: **`n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. The current value of `y1` is `r[3] - 1`, and `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`.**
