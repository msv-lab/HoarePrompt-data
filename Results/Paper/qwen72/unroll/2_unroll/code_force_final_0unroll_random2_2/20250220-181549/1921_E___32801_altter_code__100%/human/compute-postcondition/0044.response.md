Postcondition: **`n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. If `y2` <= `y1`, then `y1` is `r[3] - 1`, `y2` is 1, `a` is 0, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, and `c` is `y1 - 1`. Otherwise, if `y2` > `y1`, then `y1` is `r[3] + 1 + a`, `y2` is equal to `m`, `a` is `r[1] - y2`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, and `c` is `m - y1`. The current value of `b // 2` is greater than `a`, the absolute difference between `x2` and `c` is greater than or equal to `x1 + c`, `y1` is between 1 and `m` (inclusive), and `x1` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive).**
