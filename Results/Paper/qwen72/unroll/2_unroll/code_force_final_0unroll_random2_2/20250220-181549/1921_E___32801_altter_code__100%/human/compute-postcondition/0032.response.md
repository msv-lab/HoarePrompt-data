Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement.

### Initial State:
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + a`.
- `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- If `y1` >= `y2`, then:
  - `y1` is `r[3] - 1`.
  - `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`.
  - `a` is `y2 - 1`.
- Otherwise, if `y1` < `y2`, then:
  - `y1` is `r[3] + 1`.
  - `y2` is greater than `y1`.
  - `a` is equal to `r[1] - y2`.
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
- `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
- Additionally, either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `n` and `m` are elements from the list `r`.
   - `x1` and `x2` are defined based on elements from `r` and the variable `a`.
   - The difference `x2 - x1` is an even number.
   - `y1` and `y2` are defined based on the relationship between `y1` and `y2` and elements from `r`.
   - `a` is defined differently based on the relationship between `y1` and `y2`.
   - `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.
   - `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
   - The final condition states that either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

2. **Final Condition:**
   - The condition `either x2 <= x1, or x1 < 1, or x2 > n` must be true for the given initial state.
   - This condition implies that the values of `x1` and `x2` are such that one of these inequalities holds.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains only a `print('draw')` statement.
   - This statement will always print the string `'draw'` regardless of the values of the variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print('draw')` statement will print the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
