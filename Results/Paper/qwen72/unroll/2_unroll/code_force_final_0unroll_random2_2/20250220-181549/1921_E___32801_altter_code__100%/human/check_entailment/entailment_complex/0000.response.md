### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.

2. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - The program first checks if `x2 <= x1`. If this condition is true, it immediately prints "draw" and returns. This is correct because if Bob's chip is already at or above Alice's chip, neither can move to the other's position, and the game ends in a draw.

3. **Odd Difference Case**:
   - If the difference `(x2 - x1)` is odd, the program checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Alice" and returns. This is correct because Alice can always move to Bob's position in one move if the difference in their x-coordinates is odd and their y-coordinates are the same.
   - If `y1 != y2`, the program adjusts `x1` and `y1` to simulate a move by Alice. It then checks if `y1 == y2` again. If true, it prints "Alice" and returns.
   - If `y1` is still not equal to `y2`, it calculates `a`, `b`, and `t` to simulate further moves. It then checks if the conditions for Alice to win are met. If true, it prints "Alice" and returns. Otherwise, it prints "draw" and returns.

4. **Even Difference Case**:
   - If the difference `(x2 - x1)` is even, the program checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "bob" and returns. This is correct because Bob can always move to Alice's position in one move if the difference in their x-coordinates is even and their y-coordinates are the same.
   - If `y1 != y2`, the program adjusts `x1` and `y1` to simulate a move by Alice. It then checks if `y1 == y2` again. If true, it prints "bob" and returns.
   - If `y1` is still not equal to `y2`, it calculates `a`, `b`, and `t` to simulate further moves. It then checks if the conditions for Bob to win are met. If true, it prints "bob" and returns. Otherwise, it prints "draw" and returns.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct outcome for each test case: "Alice", "bob", or "draw".

### Issues:
- **Consistency in Output**: The program uses both "Alice" and "bob" for the output. However, the problem description specifies that the output should be "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw". The lowercase "bob" is incorrect and should be "Bob".
- **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` should take parameters for the board dimensions and initial chip positions, but it does not. This is a structural issue, though it does not affect the correctness of the logic within the function.

### Correctness:
- **Logical Correctness**: The logic within the function is correct and follows the problem description.
- **Output Consistency**: The output should be consistent with the problem description, which requires "Bob" to be capitalized.

### Conclusion:
- The program is logically correct but has an issue with the output format. Therefore, the overall correctness is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
