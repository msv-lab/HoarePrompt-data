Postcondition: ***`n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + a`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1 - a`, `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. If `y1` <= `y2`, then `y1` is 1 and `y2` is `r[5] - a`, and `c` is equal to `y2 - 1`. Otherwise, `y1` is `m` and `y2` is `r[5] + a`, and `c` is equal to `m - y2`.***
