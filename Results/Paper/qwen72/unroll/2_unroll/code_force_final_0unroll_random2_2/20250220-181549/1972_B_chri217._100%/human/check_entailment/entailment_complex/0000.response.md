Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The key to solving this problem is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, the player whose turn it is will always be able to make a move, and the opponent will eventually be left with no moves. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, the player whose turn it is will eventually be left with no moves, and the opponent will win.

Let's break down the functions:

1. **func_1**: This function reads the input and constructs a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins. The function correctly reads the input and constructs the list of test cases as required.

2. **func_2**: This function takes a test case and determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. The function counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` and returns 'YES' if the count is even, and 'NO' if the count is odd.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation of `func_2`. The function should return 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters is odd (since Alice will have a winning move in this case) and 'NO' if the number of 'U' characters is even (since Bob will have a winning move in this case).

Therefore, the correct implementation of `func_2` should be:
```python
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
```
But the logic in the function is incorrect. It should be:
```python
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 != 0 else 'NO'
```

Given the current implementation, the function will return 'YES' when the number of 'U' characters is even, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
