### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` pairs of `n` and `s` from the input. This function correctly formats the input into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.

2. **Determining the Winner:**
   - `func_2` is responsible for determining the winner based on the number of facing-up coins (`'U'` characters) in the string `s`.
   - The key observation is that the game is essentially about the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, the player who is about to move will always be able to make a move, and the game will continue. If the number of facing-up coins is even, the player who is about to move will eventually be unable to make a move, and the game will end.
   - Since Alice goes first, she will win if the number of facing-up coins is odd (because she can always make the first move, and the game will continue with an even number of facing-up coins, which will eventually leave Bob with no moves). Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win because Alice will be the one who eventually cannot make a move.

3. **Implementation of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` counts the number of `'U'` characters in the string `s` and returns `'YES'` if the count is odd (indicating Alice will win) and `'NO'` if the count is even (indicating Bob will win).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - If there are no facing-up coins (`ups == 0`), the function returns `'NO'` (Bob wins).
     - If there is only one facing-up coin (`ups == 1`), the function returns `'YES'` (Alice wins).
     - If there are two coins left and both are facing up, the function returns `'NO'` (Bob wins).

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic of the program is consistent with the problem description. The game's outcome is determined by the parity of the number of facing-up coins, and the program correctly implements this logic.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
