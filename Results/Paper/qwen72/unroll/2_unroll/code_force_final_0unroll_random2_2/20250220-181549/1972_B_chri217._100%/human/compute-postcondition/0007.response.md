Functionality: ** The function reads from standard input a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It returns a list of `t` tuples, where `t` is the number of test cases provided, and each tuple contains the integer `n` and the corresponding string `s`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the integer `t` and the list `cases` are as read from the input, with `cases` being the returned value. **
