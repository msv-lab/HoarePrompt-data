The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('! -1', flush=True)
```

This statement prints the string `! -1` and sets the `flush` parameter to `True`, which ensures that the output is immediately written to the console.

The initial state provides the values of `i`, `cnt`, and `l`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Output: **! -1**
