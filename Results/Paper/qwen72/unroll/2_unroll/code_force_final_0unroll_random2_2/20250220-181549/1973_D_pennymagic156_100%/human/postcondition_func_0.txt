The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and returns a list of integers derived from this input. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list of integers, assuming the user input was valid. If the user input is not a valid sequence of space-separated integers, the function will raise a `ValueError`.
