The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the step value `-1`. For the loop to execute, the starting value of `i` must be `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0. Given that `n` and `k` are positive integers and `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`, the condition `n > 0` is already satisfied. Therefore, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to match the starting value of `n`.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is 1, `i` is `n`**
