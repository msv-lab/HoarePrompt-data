To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the loop step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `v` is the largest integer `i` in the range [1, n] for which `func_2()` returns `n`. If no such `i` exists, `v` remains 1.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(1, n // k + 1)`):**
   - This loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n // k`.
   - For each `i`, the inner loop is executed.

2. **Inner Loop (`while cnt and l < n + 1`):**
   - `cnt` is initialized to `k` at the start of each iteration of the outer loop.
   - `l` is initialized to 1 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop.
   - The loop prints a query `? {l} {i * v}` and then updates `l` to `func_2() + 1`.
   - `cnt` is decremented by 1 after each iteration of the inner loop.
   - The inner loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Condition after Inner Loop:**
   - If `cnt` becomes 0 and `l` equals `n + 1`, it prints `! {i * v}` and calls `func_2()` again, then returns.

### Key Observations:
- The inner loop will run `k` times for each `i` as long as `l` does not exceed `n`.
- `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1` after each print statement.
- The loop will stop if `l` reaches `n + 1` before `cnt` becomes 0, or if `cnt` becomes 0 and `l` is exactly `n + 1`.

### Output State:
- The value of `i` will be the last value it reached in the outer loop, which is `n // k`.
- The value of `cnt` will be 0 because the inner loop runs `k` times.
- The value of `l` will be `n + 1` because the inner loop stops when `l` reaches `n + 1`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`i = n // k`, `cnt = 0`, `l = n + 1`.**
