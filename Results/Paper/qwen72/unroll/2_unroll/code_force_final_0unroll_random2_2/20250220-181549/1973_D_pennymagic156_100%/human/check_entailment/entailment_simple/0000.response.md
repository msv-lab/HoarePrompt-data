### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up the Interaction:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_3()`, which correctly parses the input into integers.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value `v`:**
   - The program attempts to find the maximum value `v` in the array `a` by making queries of the form `? 1 (i * n)`.
   - It iterates from `n` down to `1` and checks if the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n` is equal to `n`.
   - If such an `r` is found, `v` is set to `i` and the loop breaks. This ensures that `v` is the largest possible value in the array `a`.

3. **Checking for Valid Subarrays:**
   - The program then tries to find a valid sequence of subarrays by making queries of the form `? l (i * v)`.
   - It iterates over possible values of `i` from `1` to `n // k + 1` and for each `i`, it attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray has a value of `i * v`.
   - It uses a while loop to make queries and update the starting index `l` for the next subarray. If it successfully finds `k` subarrays, it prints the answer `! (i * v)` and returns.

4. **Handling No Valid Subarray Case:**
   - If no valid subarray sequence is found after the loop, the program prints `! -1` to indicate that no such `m` exists.

5. **Flushing Output:**
   - The program correctly flushes the output after each query and answer, ensuring that the interaction with the judge is maintained.

### Correctness:

- **Finding the Maximum Value `v`:**
  - The program correctly identifies the maximum value `v` in the array by making queries from `n` down to `1`. This is a valid approach because the maximum value in the array will be the largest `i` for which `f(1, n) = i * n`.

- **Checking for Valid Subarrays:**
  - The program attempts to find a valid sequence of subarrays by making queries of the form `? l (i * v)`. This is a valid approach because it ensures that the subarrays have the same value `i * v`.
  - The logic to update `l` and `cnt` is correct, ensuring that the program checks all possible subarrays and stops if it finds a valid sequence.

- **Handling No Valid Subarray Case:**
  - If no valid subarray sequence is found, the program correctly prints `! -1`.

- **Interaction and Flushing:**
  - The program correctly handles the interaction by flushing the output after each query and answer, which is essential for the judge to process the queries and provide feedback.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. It follows the rules of the interaction and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
