Reasoning:

1. **Reading Inputs**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_5()` for each one. This is the correct approach for handling multiple test cases in an interactive problem.

2. **func_5()**:
   - **Initialization**: It reads two integers `n` and `k` using `func_3()`, which correctly parses the input.
   - **Finding the Maximum Value**:
     - It initializes `v` to 1.
     - It iterates over `i` from `n` down to 1, making a query to find the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`.
     - If `v` (the returned value) is equal to `n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. This step is intended to find the maximum value `v` such that `f(1, r) = v * n` for some `r`.
   - **Checking for Valid Subarrays**:
     - It iterates over `i` from 1 to `n // k + 1`, making a series of queries to check if the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray has a value `f(l, r) = i * v`.
     - For each `i`, it initializes `cnt` to `k` and `l` to 1.
     - It makes queries to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v`.
     - If it successfully finds `k` such subarrays (i.e., `cnt` becomes 0 and `l` becomes `n + 1`), it prints the result `! {i * v}` and returns.
   - **No Valid Subarray Found**:
     - If no valid subarray is found, it prints `! -1` and returns.

3. **Interactive Queries**:
   - The program uses `func_2()` to read the responses to its queries, which is appropriate for the interactive nature of the problem.
   - It flushes the output after each query to ensure the response is sent and received correctly.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k = 1` by finding the maximum value `v` such that `f(1, r) = v * n` and then printing `! {v * n}`.
   - It also handles the case where no valid subarray can be found by printing `! -1`.

5. **Query Limit**:
   - The program makes at most `2 * n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It follows the rules for making queries, handles the responses appropriately, and correctly determines the largest value `m` or `-1` if no such value exists.

Correctness: **True**
