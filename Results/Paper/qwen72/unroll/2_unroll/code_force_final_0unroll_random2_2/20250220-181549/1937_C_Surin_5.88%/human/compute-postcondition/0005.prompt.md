You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is part of an interactive problem where the input is a sequence of test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can make at most 3n queries to find two indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop outputs two indices `prev` and `v1` such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation is maximized. The loop iterates through all test cases, and for each test case, it queries the input to find these indices and then prints them in the format `! {prev} {v1}`. After all iterations, the variables `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `prev` will have their final values corresponding to the last test case processed. The total number of queries made for all test cases will not exceed the allowed limit of 3n.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. It is designed to interactively find two indices i and j within a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) provided as part of a sequence of test cases. The function returns the indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The function can make at most 3n queries to achieve this.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
