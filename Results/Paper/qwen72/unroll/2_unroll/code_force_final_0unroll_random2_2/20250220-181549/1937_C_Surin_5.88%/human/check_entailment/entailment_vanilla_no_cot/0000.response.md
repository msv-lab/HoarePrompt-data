Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR**:
   - The program initializes `v1` to 0 and iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it compares the bitwise OR of `p_v1` with itself and `p_i` with itself using the query `"? {v1} {v1} {i} {i}"`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `v1` to `i`. This ensures that `v1` is the index of the element with the maximum value in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum for XOR**:
   - The program initializes `prev` to 0 and iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` again.
   - For each index `i`, it compares the bitwise OR of `p_v1` with `p_i` and `p_v1` with `p_prev` using the query `"? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}"`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `prev` to `i`. This ensures that `prev` is the index of the element that, when XORed with `p_v1`, gives the maximum possible XOR value.

4. **Outputting the Result**:
   - After finding the indices `prev` and `v1`, the program outputs the answer `! {prev} {v1}` and flushes the output.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The program uses at most `2n` queries, which is within the allowed limit of `3n` queries.

The logic and the number of queries used are consistent with the problem requirements, and the program correctly identifies a pair of indices that maximizes the XOR value. Therefore, the program is correct.
