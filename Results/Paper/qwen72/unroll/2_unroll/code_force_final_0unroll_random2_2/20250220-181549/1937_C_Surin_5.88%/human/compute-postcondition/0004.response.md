Functionality: **The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. It is designed to interactively find two indices i and j within a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) provided as part of a sequence of test cases. The function returns the indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The function can make at most 3n queries to achieve this.**
