### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves `n` children, `m` pairs of friends, and `k` excursions.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
   - The teacher randomly selects a pair of children for each excursion.
   - If the selected pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, and return the result as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The probability of selecting any specific pair of friends in any given excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected number of times a specific pair of friends is chosen in `k` excursions is \( k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair of friends over `k` excursions is the sum of the expected increases for each excursion, which is \( \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{2}{n(n-1)} = k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).

3. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected total friendship value after `k` excursions is \( f_i + k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - Summing this over all `m` pairs of friends gives the total expected value:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \right)
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + m \cdot k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
     \]

4. **Modulo Calculation:**
   - The final result needs to be computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - We need to compute the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) to handle the division in the expected value calculation.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The current implementation calculates \( f_i \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) for each pair of friends and sums these values.
     - This is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of selection and the correct expected value formula.
     - The correct formula should be \( f_i + k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \) for each pair, and then sum these values.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - It reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - The input reading and calling of `func_1` are correct, but the logic inside `func_1` is flawed.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The formula used in `func_1` is incorrect and does not account for the probability of selecting each pair of friends. The correct approach should involve calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each pair and summing these values, taking into account the modular inverse for the division.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
