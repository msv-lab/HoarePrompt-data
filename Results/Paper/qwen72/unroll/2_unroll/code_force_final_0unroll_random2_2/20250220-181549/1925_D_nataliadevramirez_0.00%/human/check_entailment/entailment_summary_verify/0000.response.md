### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for k pairs chosen randomly from n children.
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value should take into account the probability of each pair being chosen.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**:
     - The function iterates over each friendship and calculates the result as:
       ```python
       result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
       ```
     - This formula assumes that the friendship value of each pair is incremented by 1 for each excursion, which is incorrect. The friendship value increases only if the pair is chosen in an excursion, and the probability of a pair being chosen in an excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\), where \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

3. **Correct Calculation**:
   - The correct expected value for the sum of friendship values after k excursions should be:
     \[
     \text{Expected value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \right)
     \]
   - The term \(k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\) represents the expected number of times each pair of friends is chosen over k excursions.

4. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     1
     3 1 2
     1 2 1
     ```
   - Here, there are 3 children, 1 pair of friends (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1, and 2 excursions.
   - The correct expected value should be:
     \[
     1 + 2 \times \frac{1}{\binom{3}{2}} = 1 + 2 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3}
     \]
   - The program, however, calculates:
     \[
     1 \times \left( \frac{2 \times 3}{2} \right) = 1 \times 3 = 3
     \]
   - This is clearly incorrect.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the program's logic.
   - The program does not account for the probability of each pair being chosen, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program incorrectly assumes that the friendship value of each pair is incremented by 1 for each excursion, which is not the case according to the problem description. The correct approach should involve calculating the expected number of times each pair is chosen, which is \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
