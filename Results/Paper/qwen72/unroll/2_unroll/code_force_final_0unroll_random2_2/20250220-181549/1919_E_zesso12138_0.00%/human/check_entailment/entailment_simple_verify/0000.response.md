### Reasoning:

1. **`func_1(n, p)`**:
   - **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
     - The `dp` array is initialized to handle the range of possible prefix sums, which can be from `-n` to `n`. The `offset` is used to shift the indices to non-negative values.
     - `dp[offset] = 1` initializes the starting point of the prefix sum, which is 0 (since `offset = n`).

   - **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
     - The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, simulating the process of building the prefix sum array `p` one element at a time.
     - For each possible prefix sum `j` (shifted by `offset`), the function updates the `new_dp` array to account for the new possible prefix sums:
       - `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated if `j + 1` is within the valid range, representing the case where the next element in `a` is `1`.
       - `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated if `j - 1` is within the valid range, representing the case where the next element in `a` is `-1`.
     - The `dp` array is then updated to `new_dp` for the next iteration.

   - **Final Calculation**:
     - `final_sum = p[-1] + offset` calculates the final prefix sum, which is the last element of `p` (the sum of all elements in `a`) plus the `offset`.
     - The function returns `dp[final_sum]`, which is the number of ways to reach the final prefix sum.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - **Input Parsing**:
     - The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
     - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and the values of `n` and `p` for each test case.
     - The `results` list is used to store the results of `func_1` for each test case.

   - **Output**:
     - The results are printed one by one after all test cases have been processed.

### Validation of Original Assessment:

- **Initialization and Offset**:
  - The `dp` array is correctly initialized to handle the range of possible prefix sums, and the `offset` is correctly set to `n`.

- **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
  - The loop correctly updates the `dp` array to account for the new possible prefix sums at each step.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the values remain within the required range.

- **Final Calculation**:
  - The final prefix sum is correctly calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.
  - The function returns the correct value from the `dp` array.

- **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
  - The input is correctly parsed, and the function processes multiple test cases as required.
  - The results are stored and printed correctly.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- **Single Element Arrays**:
  - For `n = 1`, the only possible arrays are `[1]` and `[-1]`, which are correctly handled by the program.
- **Multiple Test Cases**:
  - The program correctly processes multiple test cases and handles the input format as specified.
- **Large Inputs**:
  - The program is designed to handle the maximum constraints (`1 <= t <= 1000` and `1 <= n <= 5000`), and the dynamic programming approach ensures efficiency.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to count the number of initial arrays `a` that could result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. It handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
