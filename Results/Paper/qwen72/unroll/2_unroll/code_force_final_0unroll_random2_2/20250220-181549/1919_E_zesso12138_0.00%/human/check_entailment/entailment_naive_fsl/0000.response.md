Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

1. **`func_1(n, p)`**:
   - This function calculates the number of possible initial arrays `a` that could result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum.
   - The `dp` array is initialized to handle the range of possible prefix sums, which can be from `-n` to `n`. The `offset` is used to shift the indices to non-negative values.
   - For each element in the array `a`, the function updates the `dp` array to account for the new possible prefix sums.
   - Finally, it returns the value in the `dp` array corresponding to the final prefix sum, which is `p[-1] + offset`.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed one by one.

The program appears to handle all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description:
- It correctly initializes the `dp` array and handles the offset.
- It processes the input in a way that is consistent with the problem's input format.
- The dynamic programming approach ensures that all possible prefix sums are considered.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program seems to work correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
