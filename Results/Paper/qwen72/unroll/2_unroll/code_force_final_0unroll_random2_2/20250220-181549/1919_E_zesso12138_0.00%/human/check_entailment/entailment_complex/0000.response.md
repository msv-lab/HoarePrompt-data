### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a sorted prefix sum array `p` of an array `a` consisting only of 1 and -1.
   - We need to count the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in the given `p` after sorting the prefix sums.
   - The result should be modulo 998244353.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
     - The function uses a DP array `dp` to keep track of the number of ways to achieve each possible prefix sum.
     - The `offset` is used to shift the prefix sums to non-negative indices, as `dp` is initialized with a length of `2 * n + 1`.
     - The initial state sets `dp[offset] = 1`, representing the starting point with a prefix sum of 0.
     - For each element in the array `a`, the function updates the DP array to reflect the possible new prefix sums after adding 1 or -1.
     - Finally, the function returns the value at `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the last element of `p` plus the `offset`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Handling**:
     - The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
     - For each test case, it extracts the integer `n` and the list `p` of prefix sums.
     - It calls `func_1(n, p)` for each test case and appends the result to a list `results`.
     - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **DP Initialization and Updates**:
     - The DP array is correctly initialized and updated to reflect the possible prefix sums.
     - The modulo operation ensures that the results do not overflow.
   - **Final Sum Calculation**:
     - The final sum is correctly calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.
   - **Input and Output Handling**:
     - The input is correctly read and split into test cases.
     - Each test case is processed independently, and the results are correctly printed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Arrays**:
     - For `n = 1`, the function correctly handles the cases where `p` is `[0]`, `[1]`, or `[-1]`.
   - **Multiple Elements**:
     - The function correctly handles the cases where `p` has multiple elements and returns the correct count of possible arrays `a`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
