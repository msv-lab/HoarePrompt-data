The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p_1 <= p_2 <= ... <= p_n, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
