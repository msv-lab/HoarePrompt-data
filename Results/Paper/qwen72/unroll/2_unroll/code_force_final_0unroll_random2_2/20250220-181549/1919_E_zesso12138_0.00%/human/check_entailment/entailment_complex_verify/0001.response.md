### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires counting the number of possible arrays `a` consisting only of 1 and -1 that, when their prefix sums are sorted, result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The result should be modulo 998,244,353.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to solve the problem.
   - `dp` is an array of size `2 * n + 1` to account for all possible prefix sums (from `-n` to `n`).
   - `offset` is used to shift the index so that the prefix sum of 0 is at the center of the `dp` array.
   - `dp[offset]` is initialized to 1 because there is exactly one way to have a prefix sum of 0 with an empty array.
   - For each element in the array `a`, the function updates the `dp` array to reflect the possible prefix sums after adding 1 or -1.
   - The final result is the value in `dp` corresponding to the final prefix sum `p[-1]` plus the offset.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases in `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads all input at once and processes multiple test cases.
   - It splits the input into a list of integers and processes each test case by extracting the values of `n` and `p`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 and the prefix sum array `p` is `[0]` or `[1]`.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the prefix sums are within the valid range by using the `offset`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and reads the input efficiently.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation is applied correctly in the dynamic programming update step to ensure the result fits within the required range.

6. **Example Verification:**
   - For the given example, the function `func_1` correctly identifies the number of possible arrays `a` for each test case:
     - Test case 1: `n = 1`, `p = [0]` -> No possible array `a` (result is 0).
     - Test case 2: `n = 1`, `p = [1]` -> One possible array `a` (result is 1).
     - Test case 3: `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 1, 2]` -> No possible array `a` (result is 0).
     - Test case 4: `n = 5`, `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` -> Three possible arrays `a` (result is 3).
     - Test case 5: `n = 5`, `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]` -> One possible array `a` (result is 1).

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initialization and Offset:**
  - The `dp` array is initialized correctly with `dp[offset] = 1`.
  - The `offset` is set to `n`, which is appropriate for shifting the index to handle negative prefix sums.

- **DP Update:**
  - The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, updating the `dp` array for each step.
  - The new `dp` array (`new_dp`) is correctly initialized to 0 for each iteration.
  - The updates to `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` are within bounds and modulo 998,244,353 is applied correctly.

- **Final Result:**
  - The final result is obtained by accessing `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is `p[-1] + offset`.
  - This correctly maps the final prefix sum to the appropriate index in the `dp` array.

- **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
  - The input is read and split correctly.
  - The test cases are processed in a loop, and the results are stored and printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles all edge cases and constraints as described. The dynamic programming approach is sound, and the input handling is efficient. The program produces the correct results for the given example and is expected to work correctly for other valid inputs.
