### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - The `dp` array is initialized to handle the range of possible prefix sums from `-n` to `n`. This is done by creating an array of size `2 * n + 1` and setting `dp[offset] = 1`, where `offset = n`. This ensures that the initial prefix sum (which is 0) is represented correctly.
   - **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
     - The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, updating the `dp` array for each possible prefix sum.
     - For each `j` in the range `[0, 2 * n]`, if `dp[j] > 0`, it means that there is a way to reach the prefix sum `j - offset`.
     - The function then updates `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` to account for the next possible prefix sums (adding 1 or -1 to the current prefix sum).
     - The `dp` array is updated to `new_dp` at the end of each iteration.
   - **Final Calculation**:
     - The final prefix sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.
     - The function returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, which represents the number of ways to reach the final prefix sum.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Input Reading**:
     - The function reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
     - It then processes the input to handle multiple test cases.
   - **Test Case Processing**:
     - For each test case, it extracts `n` and the list `p` from the input.
     - It calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - **Output**:
     - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The dynamic programming approach is correctly implemented to count the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum.
  - The `offset` is correctly used to handle negative prefix sums.
  - The final prefix sum is correctly calculated and used to return the result.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly reads and processes the input for multiple test cases.
  - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
  - The results are printed in the correct order.

- **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
  - The program handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the range of `n` and the values of `p`.
  - The program correctly handles the case where `p` is a single element (e.g., `n = 1`).
  - The program correctly handles the case where `p` is a list of all -1s or all 1s.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem and handles the input and output as specified. The program is consistent with the problem constraints and examples provided.

Final: **True**
