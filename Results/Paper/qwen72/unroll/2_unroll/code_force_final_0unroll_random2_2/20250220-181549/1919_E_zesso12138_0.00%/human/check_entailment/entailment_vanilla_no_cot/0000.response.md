Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue that prevents it from correctly solving the problem. Specifically, the dynamic programming (DP) approach in `func_1` is not correctly accounting for the constraints and properties of the prefix sum array `p`.

1. **DP Initialization and Transition:**
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized to represent the number of ways to achieve a certain prefix sum. The `offset` is used to handle negative indices.
   - The transition logic in the loop is incorrect. It assumes that each prefix sum can be reached by either adding 1 or -1 to the previous prefix sum, but it does not consider the sorted nature of the prefix sum array `p`.

2. **Final Sum Calculation:**
   - The final sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, but this does not correctly reflect the number of valid arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

3. **Handling the Constraints:**
   - The program does not check if the given prefix sum array `p` is valid. For example, if `p` is not a valid sorted prefix sum array for any array `a` consisting of only 1 and -1, the program should return 0. However, the current implementation does not perform this validation.

4. **Input Handling:**
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct, but it relies on `func_1` which is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to ensure that the prefix sum array `p` is valid and then count the number of ways to construct the array `a` that results in the given `p`.

1. **Validation of `p`:**
   - Check if the difference between consecutive elements in `p` is either 0, 1, or -1. If not, return 0.
   - Check if the first element of `p` is 0 or -1 and the last element of `p` is 0 or 1. If not, return 0.

2. **Counting Valid Arrays:**
   - Use a combinatorial approach to count the number of valid arrays `a` that can result in the given `p`. This involves counting the number of ways to arrange 1s and -1s such that the prefix sums match the given `p`.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
MOD = 998244353

def count_ways(n, p):
    # Validate the prefix sum array
    if p[0] > 0 or p[-1] < 0:
        return 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if p[i] - p[i-1] not in [0, 1, -1]:
            return 0
    
    # Count the number of 1s and -1s
    count_1 = 0
    count_neg1 = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] == 0:
            count_1 += 1
        elif p[i] == -1:
            count_neg1 += 1
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to arrange 1s and -1s
    ways = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if p[i] == p[i-1]:
            ways = (ways * (count_1 + count_neg1 - 1)) % MOD
            count_1 -= 1
        elif p[i] == p[i-1] + 1:
            ways = (ways * count_1) % MOD
            count_1 -= 1
        elif p[i] == p[i-1] - 1:
            ways = (ways * count_neg1) % MOD
            count_neg1 -= 1
    
    return ways

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = count_ways(n, p)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)
```

This solution correctly validates the prefix sum array `p` and counts the number of valid arrays `a` that can result in the given `p`.
