### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads the array `l` and constructs a prefix sum array `p` to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray.

2. **Prefix Sum Array:**
   - The prefix sum array `p` is constructed by iterating over the array `l` and accumulating the sum `c`.
   - This allows the program to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` using the formula `p[r_i - 1] - p[l_i - 2]`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `a` and `b` which define the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]`.
   - It calculates the sum `s` of the subarray using the prefix sum array.
   - The program then checks two conditions:
     - `b - a + 1 > 1`: This ensures that the subarray has more than one element. If the subarray has only one element, it cannot be "good" because there is no way to replace a single element with another positive integer that is different.
     - `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`: This ensures that the sum of the subarray is at least twice the number of elements in the subarray. This is necessary because each element in the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` must be replaced with a different positive integer, and the smallest possible sum of `b` (where each `b_i` is 1) is `b - a + 1`. Therefore, the sum `s` must be at least `2 * (b - a + 1)` to allow for a valid replacement.

4. **Output:**
   - If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. The use of the prefix sum array `p` is efficient and correct for summing subarrays, and the conditions checked in the query processing are logically sound.

However, there is a minor issue in the prefix sum calculation:
- The line `if a - 2 >= 0:` should be `if a - 1 >= 1:` to correctly handle the prefix sum calculation for the subarray starting at index `a`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = []
        c = 0
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 1 >= 1:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

### Final Correctness:

Correctness: **True** (after the minor correction mentioned above)
