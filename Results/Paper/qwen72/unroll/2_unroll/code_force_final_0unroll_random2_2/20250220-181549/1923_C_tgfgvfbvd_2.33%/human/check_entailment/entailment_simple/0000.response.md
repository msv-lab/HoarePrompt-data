### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads the array `l` and constructs a prefix sum array `p`.

2. **Prefix Sum Array:**
   - The prefix sum array `p` is constructed correctly. Each element `p[i]` represents the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the array `l`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the function reads the indices `a` and `b` (1-based indices).
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a-1]` to `c[b-1]` using the prefix sum array `p`. This is done by `s = p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`, otherwise `s = p[b - 1]`.

4. **Conditions for a Good Subarray:**
   - The function checks if the length of the subarray `b - a + 1` is greater than 1.
   - It also checks if the sum of the subarray `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray `2 * (b - a + 1)`.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the subarray length is 1 (which should always result in 'NO' because there is no way to construct a different array `b` with the same sum and all elements greater than 0).
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the subarray sum is less than twice the length of the subarray, which would make it impossible to construct the array `b` as required.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of the prefix sum array ensures that each query is processed in constant time, making the solution efficient for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and efficiently processes the queries.
