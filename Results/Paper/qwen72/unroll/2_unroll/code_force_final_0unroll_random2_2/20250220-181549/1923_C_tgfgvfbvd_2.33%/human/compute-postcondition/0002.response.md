Functionality: **The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case includes an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries `q`. Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function returns the results of the queries for each test case. If the input is invalid (e.g., negative values or query indices out of bounds), the function may return an error message.**

Explanation:
- The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases.
- Each test case consists of an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9).
- Each test case also includes `q` queries, where each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n).
- The total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- The sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
- The function returns the results of the queries for each test case.
- If the input is invalid (e.g., negative values or query indices out of bounds), the function may return an error message.
