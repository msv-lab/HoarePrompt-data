Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the subarray is of length 1. According to the problem description, a subarray of length 1 cannot be good because there is no way to construct an array `b` such that `a_i â‰  b_i` and `b_i > 0`. However, the program does not correctly handle this case. For example, if the input is:

```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 1
4 4
3 4
1 3
```

The expected output should be:

```
NO
NO
YES
NO
```

But the program will output:

```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

This is incorrect because the subarray `c[1]` (which is `[1]`) and `c[4]` (which is `[4]`) are both of length 1 and should always return "NO". The program incorrectly returns "YES" for the first query.
