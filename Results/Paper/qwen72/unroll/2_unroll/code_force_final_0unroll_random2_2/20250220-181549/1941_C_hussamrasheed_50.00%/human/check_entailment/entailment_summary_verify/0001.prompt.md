You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`, and then prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `n`, `s`, `m`, and `p` are no longer in scope. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings:**
   - The program counts the number of occurrences of the substring "map" in `s` and stores it in `m`.
   - It then removes all occurrences of "map" from `s` using `s.replace('map', '')`.
   - After removing "map", it counts the number of occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` and stores it in `p`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of `m` and `p`, which represents the total number of characters removed to make the string beautiful.

### Issues:

1. **Incorrect Substring Removal:**
   - The program only removes "map" and then counts "pie". This approach is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie".
   - For example, in the string "mmapnapie", removing "map" once results in "mnapie". However, "mnapie" still contains "map" and "pie" as substrings, which means the program will not correctly count the minimum number of deletions needed.

2. **Overlapping Substrings:**
   - The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For instance, in the string "mappppie", removing "map" once results in "pppie". The remaining string still contains "pie", and the program will not correctly count the minimum deletions needed.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider both "map" and "pie" and ensure that we remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate all occurrences of these substrings.
   - One way to do this is to use a sliding window or a state machine to track the positions of "map" and "pie" and calculate the minimum deletions required.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle overlapping substrings and does not ensure the minimum number of deletions to make the string beautiful.
