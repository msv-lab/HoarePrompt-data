Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in how it handles the removal of substrings "map" and "pie". The program simply counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and removes all instances of "map" before counting "pie". This approach can lead to incorrect results in cases where "map" and "pie" overlap or where removing a "map" or "pie" affects the count of the other substring.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program will first remove the "map" and then count the "pie", leading to an incorrect count of 2 deletions. However, the correct answer should be 3 deletions (removing 'm', 'a', and 'p' to make the string "pie" disappear).

A correct approach would involve using a more sophisticated method to identify and remove overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" while ensuring the minimum number of deletions. One way to do this is to use a sliding window or dynamic programming to track the minimum deletions required to avoid both substrings.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_deletions_to_beautiful(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1  # Default: delete the current character
        if i >= 3 and (s[i-3:i] == "map" or s[i-3:i] == "pie"):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 3])  # Consider not deleting the current character if it forms "map" or "pie"
        else:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1])  # Consider not deleting the current character
    
    return dp[n]

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(min_deletions_to_beautiful(s))
```

This corrected program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful up to each position. It correctly handles overlapping substrings and ensures the minimum deletions are calculated.
