You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through a standard input mechanism (like reading from stdin) and not through function parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the first integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) represents the number of piles, and the next line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        maxsize = max(a)
        
        a.sort()
        
        mexsize = 1
        
        for sz in a:
            if sz == mexsize:
                mexsize = mexsize + 1
        
        if mexsize > maxsize:
            print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and for each test case, the output is either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are no longer in their initial states, but the final state of `t` is 0 (since the loop has completed its iterations), and the values of `n` and `a` are undefined after the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` indicating the number of piles, followed by `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not explicitly defined in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
