The only variables in the loop head are `tc` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute. The variable `tc` is initialized to 0 and will be incremented by the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0**
