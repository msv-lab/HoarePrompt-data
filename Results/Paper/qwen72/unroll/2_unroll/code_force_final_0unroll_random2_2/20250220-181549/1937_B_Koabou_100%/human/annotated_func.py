#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the integer `n` for each test case, and the two binary strings `a1` and `a2` representing the rows of the 2 x n grid. Additionally, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a1` and `a2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `a` is a list containing two strings `a1` and `a2`, each of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` will be either `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` if the loop breaks at index `i`, or `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` if the loop completes. `x` will be either `i` if the loop breaks at index `i`, or `n - 1` if the loop completes. `y` will be the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was true, or 0 if it was never true. `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `s` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `t` is either `x - i + 1` if a match is found at index `i`, or 1 if no match is found, `n` remains unchanged.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the value of s before the print statement)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is either `x - i + 1` if a match is found at index `i`, or 1 if no match is found)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings `a1` and `a2` of length `n` from the input. It then processes these strings to find a specific pattern and prints a modified string `s` and an integer `t`. The string `s` is either a concatenation of a prefix of `a1` and a suffix of `a1` and `a2` if a certain condition is met, or it remains as `a1` concatenated with the last character of `a2`. The integer `t` is either the length of the matched substring if a match is found, or 1 if no match is found. The function does not return any values but prints the results directly.
