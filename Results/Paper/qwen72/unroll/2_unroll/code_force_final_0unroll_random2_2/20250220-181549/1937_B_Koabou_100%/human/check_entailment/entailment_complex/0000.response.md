Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input for multiple test cases by using a loop to call `func_1` for each test case. Inside `func_1`, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings `a1` and `a2`.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program initializes `s` as an empty list and `x` and `y` as 0.
   - It iterates through the grid to find the lexicographically smallest path:
     - If `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1', it updates `y` to `i`.
     - If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', it constructs the path `s` as `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` and sets `x` to `i`, then breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, `s` will be `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` and `x` will be `n - 1`.

3. **Path Counting**:
   - The program initializes `t` to 1.
   - It then iterates from `y` to `x` to count the number of paths that yield the same lexicographically smallest string:
     - If `a[1][i:x]` matches `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, it updates `t` to `x - i + 1` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no match is found, `t` remains 1.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s` and the number of paths `t`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **String Concatenation**: The program constructs `s` as a list of characters, but it should be a single string. The `print(s, sep='')` should be `print(''.join(s))` to correctly print the string.
- **Path Counting Logic**: The logic for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is incorrect. The program should count the number of valid paths that result in the same string, not just the length of a matched substring.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
