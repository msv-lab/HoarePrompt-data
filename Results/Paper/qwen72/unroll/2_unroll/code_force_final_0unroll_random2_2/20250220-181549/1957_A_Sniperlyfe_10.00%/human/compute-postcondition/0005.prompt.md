You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of arr is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `freq` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the list `arr`, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4. Each value in `freq` represents the count of how many times a unique integer appears in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `arr` of integers (each representing the length of a stick) with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique integer in `arr` by 4.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4. Each value in `freq` represents the count of how many times a unique integer appears in the list `arr`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
