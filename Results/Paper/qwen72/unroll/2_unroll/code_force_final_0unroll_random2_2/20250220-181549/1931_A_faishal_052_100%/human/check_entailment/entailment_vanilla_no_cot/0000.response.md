Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program attempts to construct the word by appending the largest possible values (26) to the array `arr` when `lex` is greater than or equal to 28. This approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.
   - The correct approach should be to start with the smallest possible values and incrementally adjust to ensure the sum matches the encoded value while maintaining the lexicographical order.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing the Word**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the positions of the letters is less than 28. It should start with the smallest possible values and adjust accordingly.
   - The logic for appending values to `arr` and then sorting it is flawed. The sorting step is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To find the lexicographically smallest word, you should start with the smallest possible values for the letters and adjust them to match the encoded sum. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        word = [1, 1, 1]  # Start with 'aaa' which is the smallest lexicographically
        for i in range(2, -1, -1):
            while sum(word) < lex and word[i] < 26:
                word[i] += 1
        print(''.join(chr(w + 96) for w in word))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with the word `[1, 1, 1]`, which corresponds to "aaa".

2. **Adjusting the Word**:
   - Iterate from the last letter to the first letter (from index 2 to 0).
   - Increment the current letter until the sum of the word equals the encoded value or the letter reaches 'z' (index 26).

3. **Output**:
   - Convert the list of indices to a string and print the result.

This approach ensures that the word is constructed in the lexicographically smallest order while maintaining the correct sum.
