Output State: **The `info` list will contain `cases` sublists, each of which is a sorted list of three integers. Each sublist represents the positions of three lowercase Latin letters derived from the input `lex` value, with the positions adjusted according to the conditions in the loop. The `lex` value is used to determine the positions, and the loop ensures that the sum of the positions in each sublist equals the original `lex` value. The `cases` variable remains unchanged.**
