To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function and will start at 0. The state of `info` and `lex` are not directly part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing. However, for the loop to be meaningful, `info` should contain `cases` sublists, and each sublist should be a sorted list of three integers.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, each sublist is a sorted list of three integers**
