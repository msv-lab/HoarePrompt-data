Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`cases`). For each test case, it reads an integer (`lex`) which is the encoded sum of the positions of the three letters.

2. **Initialization**: For each test case, an empty list `arr` is initialized to store the positions of the three letters.

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program iterates over a range of 2 (to handle the first two letters).
   - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is because the smallest possible sum for two letters is 1 + 1 = 2, and the smallest possible sum for three letters is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Therefore, if `lex` is less than 28, it must be that the first two letters are 'a' (index 1).
   - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is because the largest possible sum for two letters is 26 + 26 = 52. Therefore, if `lex` is less than 52, the first two letters can be 'z' (index 26) or a combination of 'z' and a smaller letter.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is similar to the previous case but ensures that the sum is within the valid range for three letters (3 to 78).

4. **Appending the Third Letter**: After the loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`. This value represents the position of the third letter.

5. **Sorting**: The list `arr` is sorted to ensure the lexicographically smallest order of the letters.

6. **Output**: The sorted positions are converted to characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`, where 96 is the ASCII value of 'a' minus 1. The resulting string is printed.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Handling of Smaller Sums**: The logic for handling sums less than 28 is incorrect. If `lex` is less than 28, the first two letters should be 'a' (index 1), but the program should also handle the case where the third letter is not necessarily the smallest possible value. For example, for `lex = 24`, the correct output should be "aav" (1 + 1 + 22), but the program might incorrectly output "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1).

- **Incorrect Handling of Larger Sums**: The logic for handling sums greater than or equal to 52 is also incorrect. The program should consider the possibility of the first two letters being 'z' (index 26) and the third letter being the smallest possible value to achieve the sum. For example, for `lex = 70`, the correct output should be "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26), but the program might incorrectly output "zzz" (26 + 26 + 18).

- **General Logic Flaw**: The program does not correctly handle the distribution of the sum among the three letters to ensure the lexicographically smallest word. It should prioritize the smallest possible values for the first two letters and then determine the third letter.

### Correct Approach:
- For a given `lex`, the correct approach is to start with the smallest possible values for the first two letters and then determine the third letter.
- If `lex` is less than 28, the first two letters should be 'a' (index 1), and the third letter should be `lex - 2`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 52, the first letter should be 'a' (index 1), and the second letter should be the largest possible value that keeps the sum within the valid range, and the third letter should be the remaining value.
- If `lex` is between 52 and 78, the first two letters should be the largest possible values that keep the sum within the valid range, and the third letter should be the remaining value.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle the distribution of the sum to ensure the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
