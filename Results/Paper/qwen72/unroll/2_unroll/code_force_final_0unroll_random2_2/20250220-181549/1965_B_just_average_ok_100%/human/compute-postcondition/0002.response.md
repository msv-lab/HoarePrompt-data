The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n. Additionally, there is a parameter `t` which is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, likely representing the number of test cases.

The function returns different values based on the input parameters:
- Case_1: If `t` is outside the range of 1 to 1000, the function returns an error message indicating that `t` is out of the valid range.
- Case_2: For each valid test case, if `n` and `k` are within their respective ranges, the function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^6), and `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n). If `t` is out of the valid range, it returns an error message. For each valid test case, it returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
