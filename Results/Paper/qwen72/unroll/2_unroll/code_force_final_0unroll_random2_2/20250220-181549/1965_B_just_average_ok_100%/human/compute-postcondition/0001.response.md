Output State: **For each test case, the loop modifies the list `nums` by removing the element `1 << idx` and adding three new elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The length of `nums` will be 24, and the elements will be the original elements of `nums` (excluding the removed one), plus the three new elements. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.**
