You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop modifies the list `nums` by removing the element `1 << idx` and adding three new elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The length of `nums` will be 24, and the elements will be the original elements of `nums` (excluding the removed one), plus the three new elements. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. The function then modifies a list `nums` which initially contains powers of 2 from 1 to 2^20. It removes one element from `nums` and adds three new elements based on the value of `k`. Finally, it prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the list. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
     - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there exists a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to `2^20` (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1048576]`).
   - It then finds the largest index `idx` such that `1 << idx` (which is `2^idx`) is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It appends three additional elements to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]` (which is `k - 2^idx`).
     - `k + 1`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1` (which is `k + 2^idx + 1`).
   - It removes `1 << idx` (which is `2^idx`) from `nums`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **No Subsequence Sums to `k`:**
     - The sequence `nums` initially contains powers of 2, which are unique and non-overlapping in their binary representation.
     - By removing `2^idx` and adding `k - 2^idx`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^idx + 1`, the program ensures that no subsequence of `nums` can sum to `k`.
     - The addition of `k - 2^idx` ensures that the sum of any subsequence that includes this element will be less than `k` by at least `2^idx`.
     - The addition of `k + 1` and `k + 2^idx + 1` ensures that the sum of any subsequence that includes these elements will be greater than `k`.

   - **All Other Sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`):**
     - The sequence `nums` initially contains all powers of 2 up to `2^20`, which can represent any sum from 1 to `2^21 - 1` (which is greater than `10^6`).
     - By removing `2^idx` and adding `k - 2^idx`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^idx + 1`, the program ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can still be formed.
     - The removal of `2^idx` and the addition of `k - 2^idx` ensures that the sums that were previously formed using `2^idx` can now be formed using `k - 2^idx` and other elements.
     - The addition of `k + 1` and `k + 2^idx + 1` ensures that the sums that were previously greater than `k` can still be formed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is very small or very large within the constraints.
   - The sequence `nums` is always of size at most 25, which satisfies the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) to be formed.

Correctness: **True**
