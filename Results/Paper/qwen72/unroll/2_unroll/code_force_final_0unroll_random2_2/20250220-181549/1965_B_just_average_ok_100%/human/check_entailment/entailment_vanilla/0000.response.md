### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Approach in the Program:**
   - The program starts by generating a sequence of powers of 2 up to `2^20` (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 1048576]`).
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and removes it from the sequence.
   - It appends three additional numbers to the sequence: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
     - By removing the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`, the program ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`. This is because the sum of any subset of the remaining powers of 2 will not include the removed power, and thus cannot reach `k`.
   - **Subsequence for All `v` in `[1, n]` (excluding `k`):**
     - The sequence of powers of 2 up to `2^20` can represent any number in the range `[1, 2^21 - 1]` (which is much larger than `10^6`).
     - By removing `1 << idx` (i.e., `2^idx`), the program ensures that the sum `k` is not achievable.
     - The additional numbers `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are added to ensure that all other values in the range `[1, n]` can be represented by some subsequence.
     - Specifically, `k - nums[idx]` ensures that values close to `k` can be represented, and `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` ensure that values just above `k` can be represented.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is a power of 2 by removing the exact power of 2 and adding the necessary values to ensure the conditions are met.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is 1 by removing `1` and adding `0`, `2`, and `3` to the sequence.

5. **Output Constraints:**
   - The program ensures that the size of the sequence `a` is at most 25, which is within the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other values in the range `[1, n]` to be represented by some subsequence.

**Correctness: True**
