### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
     - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there exists a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to `2^20` (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1048576]`).
   - It then finds the largest index `idx` such that `1 << idx` (which is `2^idx`) is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It appends three additional elements to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]` (which is `k - 2^idx`).
     - `k + 1`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1` (which is `k + 2^idx + 1`).
   - It removes `1 << idx` (which is `2^idx`) from `nums`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **No Subsequence Sums to `k`:**
     - The sequence `nums` initially contains powers of 2, which are unique and non-overlapping in their binary representation.
     - By removing `2^idx` and adding `k - 2^idx`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^idx + 1`, the program ensures that no subsequence of `nums` can sum to `k`.
     - The addition of `k - 2^idx` ensures that the sum of any subsequence that includes this element will be less than `k` by at least `2^idx`.
     - The addition of `k + 1` and `k + 2^idx + 1` ensures that the sum of any subsequence that includes these elements will be greater than `k`.

   - **All Other Sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`):**
     - The sequence `nums` initially contains all powers of 2 up to `2^20`, which can represent any sum from 1 to `2^21 - 1` (which is greater than `10^6`).
     - By removing `2^idx` and adding `k - 2^idx`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^idx + 1`, the program ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can still be formed.
     - The removal of `2^idx` and the addition of `k - 2^idx` ensures that the sums that were previously formed using `2^idx` can now be formed using `k - 2^idx` and other elements.
     - The addition of `k + 1` and `k + 2^idx + 1` ensures that the sums that were previously greater than `k` can still be formed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is very small or very large within the constraints.
   - The sequence `nums` is always of size at most 25, which satisfies the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) to be formed.

Correctness: **True**
