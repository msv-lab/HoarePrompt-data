Based on the initial state provided:

- The `permutation` list is unchanged.
- `curr_v` is unchanged.
- `n`, `k`, `idx`, and `idx_v` remain unchanged.
- `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.

The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result`, which is constructed by joining the elements of the `permutation` list with spaces.

Since the exact values of the `permutation` list are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `permutation`.

Output: **"elements of permutation separated by spaces" (where "elements of permutation" are the elements of the `permutation` list)**
