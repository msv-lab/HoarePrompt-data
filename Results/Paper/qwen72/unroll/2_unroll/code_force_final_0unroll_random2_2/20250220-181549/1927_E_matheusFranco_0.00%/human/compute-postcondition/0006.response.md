Output State: **The `permutation` list is updated such that for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, the elements at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` (up to the length of the `permutation` list) are filled with consecutive integers starting from `1`. The `curr_v` variable is updated to the next integer after the last value assigned in the `permutation` list. The variables `n`, `k`, `idx`, and `idx_v` remain unchanged.**
