The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. Given the initial state, `k` is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. To ensure the loop executes, `k` must be at least 2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` must be at least 2**
