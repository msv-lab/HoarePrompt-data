The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple parameters. Specifically, it accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, where 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not described in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided parameters.**
