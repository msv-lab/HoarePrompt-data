Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of the odd-indexed subarrays of `a`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, the length of `odds` is (n + 1) // 2, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, `prev` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the introduction of the variable `prev`, which is now set to 0. All other conditions and variable values remain the same.
