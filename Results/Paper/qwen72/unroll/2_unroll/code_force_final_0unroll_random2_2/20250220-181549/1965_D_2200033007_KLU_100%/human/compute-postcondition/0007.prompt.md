You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing the sums of the odd-indexed subarrays of a, n is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, and the length of odds is (n + 1) // 2.
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers where each element at an odd index is half the difference between the corresponding element in `odds` and the previous element in `odds`, and the element at the middle index (if `n` is odd) is the corresponding element in `odds`. `prev` is the last element in `odds`. `idx` is -1.
    return a
    #The program returns the list `a` where each element at an odd index is half the difference between the corresponding element in `odds` and the previous element in `odds`, and if `n` is odd, the element at the middle index is the corresponding element in `odds`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `odds` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `a` where each element at an odd index is half the difference between the corresponding element in `odds` and the previous element in `odds`. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `a` is the corresponding element in `odds`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `a` where each element at an odd index is half the difference between the corresponding element in `odds` and the previous element in `odds`, and if `n` is odd, the element at the middle index is the corresponding element in `odds`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
