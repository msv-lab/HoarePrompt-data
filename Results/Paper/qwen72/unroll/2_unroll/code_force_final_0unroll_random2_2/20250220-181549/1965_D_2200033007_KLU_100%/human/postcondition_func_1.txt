The function `func_2` accepts a list `cts` of integers and returns a list `odds` containing the elements from `cts` that appear an odd number of times. The function modifies the list `odds` during its execution, but the final state of the program after the function concludes is that `odds` contains only those elements from `cts` that appear an odd number of times, and all other elements are removed.
