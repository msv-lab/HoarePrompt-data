Output State: **The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. The value of `t` is now an integer read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that the function `func` is expected to read input from stdin.
- The first line of input is read and converted to an integer, which is then assigned to the variable `t`.
- The value of `t` is now a specific integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged, as the code only affects the value of `t`.
