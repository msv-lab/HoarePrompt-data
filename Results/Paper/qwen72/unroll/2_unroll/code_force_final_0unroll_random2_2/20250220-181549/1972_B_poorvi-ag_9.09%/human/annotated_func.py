#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: The function `func` has read `t` test cases from stdin, and for each test case, it has read an integer `n` and a string `arr`. The list `results` now contains `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated in the loop. Specifically, if `n` is even, 'no' is appended to `results`. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended. Otherwise, 'no' is appended. The variable `t` remains the same as the initial input.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The function `func` has read `t` test cases from stdin, and for each test case, it has read an integer `n` and a string `arr`. The list `results` now contains `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated in the loop. Specifically, if `n` is even, 'no' is appended to `results`. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended. Otherwise, 'no' is appended. The variable `t` remains the same as the initial input. The loop has printed each element of the `results` list, one per line. The `results` list is unchanged after the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of coins and their initial states represented by a string of "U" and "D". For each test case, the function determines if it is possible to achieve a specific condition and appends 'yes' or 'no' to a list `results` based on the following rules: If the number of coins `n` is even, 'no' is appended. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in the string is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended. Otherwise, 'no' is appended. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element of `results`, one per line. The function does not return any value.
