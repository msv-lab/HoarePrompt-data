Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input string `s` has all unique characters. In such a case, the program might still output `s` as the rearranged string `s2`, which would violate the requirement that `s2` must not be equal to `s`. For example, if the input string is "abc", the program might randomly select "abc" as the rearranged string, which is not a valid output according to the problem description.
