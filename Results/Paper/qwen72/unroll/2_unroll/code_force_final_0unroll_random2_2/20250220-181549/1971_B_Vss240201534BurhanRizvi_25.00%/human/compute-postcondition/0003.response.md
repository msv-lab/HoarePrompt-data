Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer from the user, which determines the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads a string `s` from the user, shuffles the characters of `s` to create a new string `s2`, and prints 'Yes' followed by `s2` if `s2` is different from `s`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints 'No'. After the loop completes, the final state of the program includes the values of `s` and `s2` from the last iteration, but these are not returned or used outside the function. The function does not return any value. **
