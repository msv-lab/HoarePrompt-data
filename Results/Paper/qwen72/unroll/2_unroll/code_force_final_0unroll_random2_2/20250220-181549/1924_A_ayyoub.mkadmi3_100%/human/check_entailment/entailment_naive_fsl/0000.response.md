Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`. 

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2 3
aab
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
ba
```

**Actual Output:**
```
No
aa
```

The program incorrectly identifies "aa" as a string that does not occur as a subsequence in "aab". However, "aa" is a valid subsequence of "aab". The correct string that does not occur as a subsequence in "aab" is "ba".

The issue lies in the logic of `func_1` where it tries to construct a string that does not occur as a subsequence by removing characters from the alphabet set and then appending the remaining characters. This approach does not guarantee that the constructed string is one that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.
