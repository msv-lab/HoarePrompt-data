The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `s`, `k`, and `n`. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. `k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 26. The function returns a tuple containing three elements:
- A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`.
- A substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`.
- The string `s2`, which is either the last character of `s` if `s` contains all k alphabets at least once, or an empty string.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26) and `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26). It returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the string `s2` which is the last character of `s` if `s` contains all k alphabets at least once, otherwise an empty string.**
