#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:

    #State: `s1` is a string containing all characters from `s` in the same order, `s2` is a string containing the last character of `s` if `s` contains all k alphabets at least once, otherwise `s2` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the string `s2` which is either the last character of `s` if `s` contains all k alphabets at least once or an empty string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `s` of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26) and `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26). It processes `s` to create a new string `s1` that contains all characters from `s` in the same order, and a string `s2` which is the last character of `s` if `s` contains all k alphabets at least once, otherwise `s2` is an empty string. The function returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1` where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`, and the string `s2`.
