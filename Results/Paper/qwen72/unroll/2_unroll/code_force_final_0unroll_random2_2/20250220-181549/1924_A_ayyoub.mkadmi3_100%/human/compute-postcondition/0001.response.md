Output State: **`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `s1` is an empty string, `s2` is an empty string.**

The code initializes `s2` as an empty string, which was previously not defined. The other variables (`s`, `k`, `n`, and `s1`) remain unchanged.
