The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that maps the input from `input().split()` to integers. This function `r` can be used to read space-separated integers from the input and convert them to a list or other iterable of integers. The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `queries` are not directly affected by this code snippet, but the function `r` is now available for use in subsequent parts of the program to read and process inputs.

Output State: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. For each test case: n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the number of cities; a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order; m is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), representing the number of queries; and queries is a list of m tuples (x_i, y_i) where (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n) and (x_i ≠ y_i), representing the pairs of cities for which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `r` is a lambda function that maps input to integers.**
