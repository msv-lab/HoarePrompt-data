Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `aa` and `bb` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates the number of times the number of common elements between the first `m` elements of `aa` and the elements of `bb` is greater than or equal to `k` as a sliding window of size `m` moves over `aa`. The function prints the total count of such occurrences for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. **
