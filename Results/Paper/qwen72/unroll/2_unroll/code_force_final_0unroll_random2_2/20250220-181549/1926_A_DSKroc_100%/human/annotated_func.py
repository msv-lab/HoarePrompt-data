#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct. The function should output the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each test case to stdout.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: The loop will have printed either 'A' or 'B' for each of the `t` test cases, depending on whether the count of 'A' characters in the string was greater than the count of 'B' characters. The variables `ac` and `bc` will be reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, and `q` will have iterated from 0 to `t-1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a number of test cases `t` from standard input, where each test case is a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints the most frequent character to standard output. If the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value, and the value of `t` remains unchanged after the function concludes.
