The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', and all `t` strings are distinct. The function outputs the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each test case to stdout. If the number of 'A's and 'B's is equal, it outputs one of the characters.
