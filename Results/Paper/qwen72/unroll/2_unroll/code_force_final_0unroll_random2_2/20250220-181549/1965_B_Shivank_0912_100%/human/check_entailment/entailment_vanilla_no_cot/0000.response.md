Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `k`**:
   - The program iterates to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` by incrementing `i` until `1 << (i + 1)` exceeds `k`. This effectively finds the highest bit set in `k`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - The sequence `ans` is initialized with three specific values: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
   - These values are chosen to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing for the construction of all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`).

4. **Adding Remaining Powers of 2**:
   - The program then appends the remaining powers of 2 (from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`, excluding `1 << i`) to the sequence `ans`. This ensures that the sequence can form any sum that is a combination of these powers of 2, which covers a wide range of possible values.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence `ans` and then the elements of `ans`.

### Verification:
- **Condition 1**: No subsequence of `ans` should sum to `k`.
  - The values `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` are chosen such that no combination of them can sum to `k`.
  - The remaining powers of 2 are added in a way that avoids forming `k` as a sum.

- **Condition 2**: For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there should be a subsequence of `ans` that sums to `v`.
  - The sequence `ans` includes a wide range of powers of 2, which allows for the construction of any sum from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`).

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program appears to generate a valid sequence for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
