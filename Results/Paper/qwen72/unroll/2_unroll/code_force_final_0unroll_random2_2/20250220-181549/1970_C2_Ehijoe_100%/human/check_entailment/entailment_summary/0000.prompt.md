Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the medium version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on trees.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with a stone on
exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists of picking
an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there
(thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after which he
alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player that
cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who wins
each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

    1 2

Output

    Ron

# Functions with Execution Summary:
from functools import reduce
import math
from collections import deque, defaultdict

t = 1
for i in range(t):
    func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(nodes, start, parent=None):
    if len(nodes[start]) == 1 and nodes[start][0] == parent:
        return False
    distances = []
    for node in nodes[start]:
        if node != parent:
            distances.append(not func_1(nodes, node, start))
    return any(distances)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `nodes` representing a tree, an integer `start` (1 <= start <= len(nodes)), and an integer or `None` `parent`. It returns `False` if the starting node `start` has only one adjacent node, and that adjacent node is the parent node. Otherwise, it recursively checks the subtree rooted at `start` and returns `True` if any node in the subtree has more than one adjacent node or if any node in the subtree is not directly connected to its parent.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    (n, t) = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
        nodes[u].append(v)
        nodes[v].append(u)
    leaves = deque()
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            leaves.append(key)
    start = int(input())
    moves = func_1(nodes, start)
    if moves:
        print('Ron')
    else:
        print('Hermione')
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and an integer `t` (which is always 1) from the input, and then constructs a graph represented by a dictionary `nodes` where each key is a node and each value is a list of its neighbors. It identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one neighbor) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. The function then reads a `start` node from the input and calls another function `func_1` with `nodes` and `start` as arguments. If `func_1` returns a non-empty result, it prints "Ron"; otherwise, it prints "Hermione". The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `nodes` is a defaultdict(list) with the same keys and values as in the initial state, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `leaves` contains all the leaf nodes, and `start` is the integer provided by the user.
