Output State: **`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `nodes` is a defaultdict(list) where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` remains unchanged, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is an empty deque.**

The code initializes `leaves` as an empty deque, but does not change the values of `n`, `t`, `nodes`, `start`, `edges`, or `empty`. Therefore, the initial state for these variables remains the same, and `leaves` is now an empty deque.
