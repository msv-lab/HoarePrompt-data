The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and an integer `t` (which is always 1) from the input, and then constructs a graph represented by a dictionary `nodes` where each key is a node and each value is a list of its neighbors. It identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one neighbor) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. The function then reads a `start` node from the input and calls another function `func_1` with `nodes` and `start` as arguments. If `func_1` returns a non-empty result, it prints "Ron"; otherwise, it prints "Hermione". The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `nodes` is a defaultdict(list) with the same keys and values as in the initial state, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `leaves` contains all the leaf nodes, and `start` is the integer provided by the user.
