Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect for the problem description. The logic used in the program does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which is incorrect. The number of valid pairs should start from 0.
   - The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`, and for each `b`, it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`. This formula does not correctly count the valid pairs.

2. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The program does not use the greatest common divisor (GCD) in its calculations, which is essential for the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
- Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
- Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Count the number of valid pairs.

However, this brute-force approach is inefficient and will not pass the time limits for large inputs. A more efficient approach involves using properties of the GCD and modular arithmetic to count the valid pairs.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
Here is a more efficient solution that uses the properties of the GCD and modular arithmetic:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This solution correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) but is still not optimal for large inputs. A more optimized approach would involve precomputing the GCD values and using them to efficiently count the valid pairs.
