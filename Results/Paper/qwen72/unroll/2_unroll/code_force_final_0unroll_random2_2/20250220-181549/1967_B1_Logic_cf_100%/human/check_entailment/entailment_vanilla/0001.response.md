Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is the starting point for counting valid pairs.

3. **Loop for \(b\):**
   - The program iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\).
   - For each \(b\), it updates `ans` using the formula: `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all \(b\) values for a given test case, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Reasoning:
1. **Initial Value of `ans`:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `n`. This is correct because for \(b = 1\), the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is always true (since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of 1).

2. **Loop for \(b\):**
   - The loop iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\). This is incorrect because \(b\) should only go up to \(m\), not \(\min(n, m) + 1\).
   - The formula used in the loop is `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`. This formula is incorrect for the given problem. The correct approach should involve checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Correct Formula:**
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \((a + b) \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The current formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not correctly count the valid pairs. It seems to be an attempt to count the number of \(a\) values for each \(b\), but it does not account for the \(\gcd\) condition.

### Correctness:
The given program is incorrect because:
- The loop for \(b\) goes beyond the valid range.
- The formula used to update `ans` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
