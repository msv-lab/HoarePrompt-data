#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving two positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The function should calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b · gcd(a, b). The input to the function is not directly provided in the function definition, but it should handle multiple test cases, each with a pair of integers `n` and `m`.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The function `func` will print the calculated value of `ans` for each test case, where `ans` is the sum of `n` and the result of the inner loop for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. The inner loop increments `ans` by `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` will remain unchanged after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input. It then calculates a value `ans` which is initially set to `n`. For each integer `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, it increments `ans` by the integer division of `(n + b)` by `(b * b)`. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged after the function execution.
