You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving two positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The function should calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b · gcd(a, b). The input to the function is not directly provided in the function definition, but it should handle multiple test cases, each with a pair of integers `n` and `m`.
def func():
    t = int(input())

        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The function `func` will print the calculated value of `ans` for each test case, where `ans` is the sum of `n` and the result of the inner loop for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. The inner loop increments `ans` by `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` will remain unchanged after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is the starting point for counting valid pairs.

3. **Loop for \(b\):**
   - The program iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\).
   - For each \(b\), it updates `ans` using the formula: `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all \(b\) values for a given test case, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Reasoning:
1. **Initial Value of `ans`:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `n`. This is correct because for \(b = 1\), the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is always true (since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of 1).

2. **Loop for \(b\):**
   - The loop iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\). This is incorrect because \(b\) should only go up to \(m\), not \(\min(n, m) + 1\).
   - The formula used in the loop is `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`. This formula is incorrect for the given problem. The correct approach should involve checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Correct Formula:**
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \((a + b) \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The current formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not correctly count the valid pairs. It seems to be an attempt to count the number of \(a\) values for each \(b\), but it does not account for the \(\gcd\) condition.

### Correctness:
The given program is incorrect because:
- The loop for \(b\) goes beyond the valid range.
- The formula used to update `ans` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
