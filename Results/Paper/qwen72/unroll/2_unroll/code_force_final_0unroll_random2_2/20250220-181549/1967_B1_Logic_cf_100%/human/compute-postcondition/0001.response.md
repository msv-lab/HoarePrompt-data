The only objects in the loop head are the variables `T` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `T` should be 0 to ensure the loop begins correctly.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0**
