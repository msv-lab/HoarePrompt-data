Precondition: **The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving two positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The function should calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b · gcd(a, b). The input to the function is not directly provided in the function definition, but it should handle multiple test cases, each with a pair of integers `n` and `m`.**
