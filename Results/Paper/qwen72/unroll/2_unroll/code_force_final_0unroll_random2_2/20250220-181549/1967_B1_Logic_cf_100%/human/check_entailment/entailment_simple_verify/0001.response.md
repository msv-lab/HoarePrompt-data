### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Value of `ans`:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `n`. This is correct because for \(b = 1\), the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is always true (since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of 1). Therefore, there are exactly `n` valid pairs for \(b = 1\).

2. **Loop for \(b\):**
   - The loop iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\). This is incorrect because \(b\) should only go up to \(m\), not \(\min(n, m) + 1\). The correct range should be from 2 to \(m\).
   - The formula used in the loop is `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`. This formula is incorrect for the given problem. The correct approach should involve checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Correct Formula:**
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \((a + b) \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The current formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not correctly count the valid pairs. It seems to be an attempt to count the number of \(a\) values for each \(b\), but it does not account for the \(\gcd\) condition.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function `func` is intended to solve the problem involving two positive integers `n` and `m` where \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\). The function should handle multiple test cases, each with a pair of integers `n` and `m`.
- **Initialization:**
  - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is correct for the initial count of pairs where \(b = 1\).
- **Loop for \(b\):**
  - The loop iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\). This is incorrect as it should only go up to \(m\).
  - The formula `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` is incorrect because it does not correctly count the valid pairs based on the \(\gcd\) condition.
- **Output:**
  - The function prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is incorrect due to the issues in the loop and the formula used.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because:
- The loop for \(b\) goes beyond the valid range.
- The formula used to update `ans` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Final: **False**
