Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` within the range 1 to 10^18. It prints 'YES' and the numbers 1, 1, 1 if `n` equals `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and the calculated value of `h` (which involves some arithmetic operations on `n` and `k`) is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by the numbers 2 and the elements of the `costs` list. The function does not return any value. **
