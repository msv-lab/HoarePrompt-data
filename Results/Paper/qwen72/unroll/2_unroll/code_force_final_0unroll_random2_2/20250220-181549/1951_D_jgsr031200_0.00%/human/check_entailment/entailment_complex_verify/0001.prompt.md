You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` within the range 1 to 10^18. It prints 'YES' and the numbers 1, 1, 1 if `n` equals `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and the calculated value of `h` (which involves some arithmetic operations on `n` and `k`) is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by the numbers 2 and the elements of the `costs` list. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from this single stall.
   - If `n < k`, the program prints "NO" and returns immediately. This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a list `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - The idea is to create a stall with a high price (`n - k + 1`) to ensure Alice buys only a few jewels from it, and a stall with a low price (`1`) to ensure Alice can buy the remaining jewels.

4. **Greedy Buying Simulation:**
   - The program iterates over the `costs` list and calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall.
   - It updates `n` by subtracting the total cost of the jewels bought from the current stall.
   - It accumulates the total number of jewels bought in `h`.

5. **Final Check:**
   - If the total number of jewels bought `h` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `h` is at least `k`, the program prints "YES" and the number of stalls (which is 2 in this case), followed by the prices of the stalls.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output for "YES" Case:**
  - The program prints "YES" and the number of stalls (2) before printing the prices of the stalls. This is incorrect because the output format should be:
    - "YES"
    - Number of stalls
    - Prices of the stalls
  - The correct order should be:
    - "YES"
    - Number of stalls
    - Prices of the stalls

- **Incorrect Logic for Cost Calculation:**
  - The program uses a fixed list `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. This approach is not always correct.
  - For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the program sets `costs` to `[5, 1]`. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (costing 5 coins) and 2 jewels from the second stall (costing 1 coin each), which totals 3 jewels. This is correct.
  - However, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program sets `costs` to `[248, 1]`. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (costing 248 coins) and 7 jewels from the second stall (costing 1 coin each), which totals 8 jewels. This is also correct.
  - The issue arises when `n` and `k` are such that the fixed approach does not work. For example, if `n = 6` and `k = 4`, the program sets `costs` to `[3, 1]`. Alice will buy 2 jewels from the first stall (costing 3 coins each) and 0 jewels from the second stall (costing 1 coin each), which totals 2 jewels, not 4. This is incorrect.

### Corrected Program:
To ensure the program works correctly for all cases, we need to adjust the logic to dynamically set the prices of the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

```python
import math as m

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        print(' '.join(str(n // k + (1 if i < n % k else 0)) for i in range(k)))
```

### Explanation of Corrected Program:
- **Initial Check:**
  - If `n < k`, print "NO" and return.
- **Dynamic Stall Prices:**
  - If `n >= k`, print "YES".
  - Set up `k` stalls.
  - For each stall, the price is calculated as `n // k + (1 if i < n % k else 0)`. This ensures that the total number of jewels Alice can buy is exactly `k`.
  - `n // k` is the base price for each stall.
  - `n % k` is the remainder, which is distributed among the first `n % k` stalls to ensure the total number of jewels bought is exactly `k`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has issues with the output format and the logic for setting stall prices. The corrected program ensures that the output format is correct and the logic for setting stall prices is dynamic and works for all valid inputs.
