The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes that `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraints 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is less than `k`. However, these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement, as it simply prints a fixed string.

Output: **NO**
