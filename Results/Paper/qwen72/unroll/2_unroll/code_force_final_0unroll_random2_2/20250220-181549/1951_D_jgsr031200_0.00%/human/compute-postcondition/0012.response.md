The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `costs`. For the loop to execute, the list `costs` must contain at least one element. According to the given state, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the expression `n - k + 1` will always result in a positive integer, ensuring that `costs` has at least two elements. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once.

However, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect the first element of `costs` before the loop starts. The variable `h` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. `i` is `n - k + 1`. `h` is 0**
