Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices so that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins. However, the current implementation of `func_1` has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of `n == k` Case**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` equals `k` by printing 'YES' and setting up a single stall with a price of 1. This is correct because Alice will buy exactly one jewel from this stall, and since `n` equals `k`, she will buy exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Handling of `n < k` Case**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `k` by printing 'NO'. This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **Handling of `n >= k` Case**:
   - The program attempts to set up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`. The idea is that Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, and then buy the remaining jewels from the second stall.
   - However, the logic for calculating `h` (the total number of jewels Alice buys) is flawed. The program calculates `h` by summing the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall, but it does not correctly account for the fact that Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall and then move to the second stall.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints 'YES' followed by the number of stalls (2) and then the prices of the stalls. This is incorrect because the output format should be 'YES' followed by the number of stalls on the next line, and then the prices of the stalls on the following line.

5. **General Solution**:
   - The program does not provide a general solution for setting up more than two stalls, which is necessary to handle cases where `k` is large and cannot be achieved with just two stalls.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect. A correct solution would need to handle the general case of setting up up to 60 stalls with appropriate prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Correctness: **False**
