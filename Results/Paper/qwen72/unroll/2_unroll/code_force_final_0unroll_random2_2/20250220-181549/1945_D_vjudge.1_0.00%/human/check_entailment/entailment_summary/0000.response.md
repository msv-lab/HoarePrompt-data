### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `numero_testes` and then calls `func_1` for each test case. This is consistent with the problem statement, which specifies that the input consists of multiple test cases.

2. **Reversing Lists:**
   - `func_1` reverses both `lista_A` and `lista_B`. This is a crucial step because it allows the function to process the queue from the end to the front, which is necessary for Kirill to determine the minimum cost to move to a position within the first `m` positions.

3. **Processing the Lists:**
   - The function initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0. `soma_b` is used to accumulate the cost of moving past people in the queue, and `pref` is used to accumulate the cost of moving to a specific position.
   - The loop from `0` to `n - k - 1` checks if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`. If true, it adds the accumulated `soma_b` to `pref` and then adds `lista_A[i]` to `pref`, resetting `soma_b` to 0. If false, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - This loop ensures that Kirill only pays the minimum cost to move to a position where the cost of moving to that position is less than the cost of moving past the next person.

4. **Finding the Minimum Cost:**
   - After the initial loop, the function initializes `resultado` to infinity. It then iterates from `n - k` to `n - 1`, calculating the minimum cost to move to each position by adding `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` to `resultado` and updating `soma_b` with `lista_B[i]`.
   - This ensures that Kirill finds the minimum cost to move to any position within the first `m` positions.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the minimum cost `resultado` for each test case, which is consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles the input and output as required. The logic for calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions is sound and aligns with the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
