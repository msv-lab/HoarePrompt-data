The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B`. `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000. `lista_A` and `lista_B` are lists of integers of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. However, based on the constraints and relationships, we can infer that the function likely processes the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` in some way that involves the integers `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts integers `n` and `k` and lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` of integers, where 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000 and each element in `lista_A` and `lista_B` is in the range 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9. The function returns a value based on the processing of these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
