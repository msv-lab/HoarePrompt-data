You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program: 
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = n - list0[-1]
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer and y = 0, and the list of x integers contains distinct values from 1 to n.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        
        num = n - list0[-1]
        
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        
        print(count + x - 2)
        
    #State: T is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 10^4, t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, and the list of x integers contains distinct values from 1 to n. The loop has printed the value of count + x - 2 for each iteration, where count is the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list of x integers, plus x - 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, where `n` is the upper bound of a range of integers, `x` is the number of distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`, and `y` is always 0. It then reads a list of `x` distinct integers from the input, sorts this list, and calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list. The function prints the sum of this count and `x - 2` for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function has printed the calculated value for each test case, and the state of the program remains as described in the initial state, with the exception that the input has been consumed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly count the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3 0
1 3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The vertices chosen by Bessie are 1, 3, and 5.
- The polygon is a pentagon (5 sides).
- The only possible non-intersecting triangle that can be formed is (1, 3, 5).
- The program, however, incorrectly counts 2 triangles.

The issue lies in the logic of the program where it calculates the number of triangles. The program assumes that if the difference between two consecutive vertices is 1, it counts a triangle. However, it does not correctly account for the fact that the polygon is cyclic, and the last vertex should be connected to the first vertex to form a valid triangle. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the vertices are not consecutive but still form a valid triangle.
