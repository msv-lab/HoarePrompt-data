Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined method, as the function definition does not include parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases, each starting with two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the following k lines contains n integers representing the order of participants as seen by the participant who posted the screenshot. Each integer in the screenshot is unique and within the range [1, n]. The total number of test cases, t, is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n · k across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `t` is assigned the value of an input integer.**
