t is a positive integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 and n \cdot k \le 2 \cdot 10^5, representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. Each of the k lines contains n unique integers a_{ij} (1 \le a_{ij} \le n) representing the order of participants as seen by the participant a_{i0}.
