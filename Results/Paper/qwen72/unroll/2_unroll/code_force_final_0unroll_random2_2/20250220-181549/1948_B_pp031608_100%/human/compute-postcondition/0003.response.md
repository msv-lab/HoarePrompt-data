The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, within the function, it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers `a` (where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). The function returns the processed result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers `a` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). It returns the processed result for each test case.**
