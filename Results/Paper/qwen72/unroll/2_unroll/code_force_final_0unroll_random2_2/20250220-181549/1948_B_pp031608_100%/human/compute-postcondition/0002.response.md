Output State: **The loop will execute `n` times, processing `n` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `m` and a list of `m` integers `arr`. It then checks if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by performing at most one operation: replacing an element with its digits in increasing order followed by the element itself. If the list can be made non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After all iterations, the variable `n` will be unchanged, and the variables `m`, `arr`, and `ans` will have their final values from the last iteration.**
