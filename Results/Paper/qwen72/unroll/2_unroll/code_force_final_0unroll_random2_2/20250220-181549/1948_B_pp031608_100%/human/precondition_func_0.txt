The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but within the function, it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers `a` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). The function should handle the input and output as described in the problem statement.
