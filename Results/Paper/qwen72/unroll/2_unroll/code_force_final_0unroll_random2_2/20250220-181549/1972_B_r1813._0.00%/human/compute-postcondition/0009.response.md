Output State: **The `index` is `t * 2 + 1`. The `results` list remains unchanged, containing `t` elements, each either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the count of 'U' in each string `s` is odd or even, respectively. The `data` list remains unchanged. The `t` variable remains the same as its initial value.**
