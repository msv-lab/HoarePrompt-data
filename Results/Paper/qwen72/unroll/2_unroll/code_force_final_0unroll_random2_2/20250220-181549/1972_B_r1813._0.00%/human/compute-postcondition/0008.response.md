The only objects in the loop head are the variable `result` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `index`, `data`, and `t` do not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. The `result` variable will take the value of the first element in `results` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`results` is a list containing `t` elements, each either 'YES' or 'NO', `result` is the first element in `results`**
