Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem description. It reads multiple test cases, processes each case to count the number of facing-up coins, and determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. The logic is as follows:

1. If the number of facing-up coins (`num_up_coins`) is odd, Alice will win because she can always make the first move, and the game will continue with an even number of facing-up coins for Bob, ensuring Alice can always respond to Bob's moves until Bob is left with no valid moves.
2. If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win because after Alice's first move, the number of facing-up coins will be odd, and Bob can then always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Alice, eventually leading to a situation where Alice has no valid moves.

The program correctly implements this logic and outputs the results for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
