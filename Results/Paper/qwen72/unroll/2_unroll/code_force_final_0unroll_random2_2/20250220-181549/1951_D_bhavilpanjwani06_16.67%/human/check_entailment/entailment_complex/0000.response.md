Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is a necessary step to handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

2. **Base Case (n < k)**: The program correctly identifies and handles the case where Alice does not have enough coins to buy the required number of jewels. If `n` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO", which is the correct output for this scenario.

3. **Exact Match (n == k)**: If Alice has exactly the number of coins needed to buy `k` jewels, the program prints "YES" followed by "1" and the value of `n`. This is a valid solution because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at `n` coins per jewel, and she will be left with 0 coins, which is acceptable.

4. **General Case (n > k)**: The program checks if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`. If this condition is true, it prints "YES" followed by "2" and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`. This is a valid solution because:
   - Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins each, spending `(k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins.
   - Alice will then buy 1 jewel from the second stall priced at 1 coin, spending 1 coin.
   - The total number of jewels bought is `k - 1 + 1 = k`, and the total number of coins spent is `(k - 1) * (n - k + 1) + 1`, which is less than or equal to `n` because `n >= k`.

5. **Infeasible Case (n > k and k - 1 >= n - k + 1)**: If `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, the program prints "NO". This condition is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of setting up more than 2 stalls to achieve the desired outcome. For example, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program should print "YES" and a valid setup, but it incorrectly prints "NO".

6. **Stall Limit**: The problem specifies that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls. The program only sets up 1 or 2 stalls, which is within the limit. However, the infeasible case check is flawed, and it should consider more stalls if necessary.

Given the above reasoning, the program is **incorrect** because it fails to handle the general case where `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1` properly. It should be able to set up more stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Correctness: **False**
