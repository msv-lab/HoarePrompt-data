The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def setup_store(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.
