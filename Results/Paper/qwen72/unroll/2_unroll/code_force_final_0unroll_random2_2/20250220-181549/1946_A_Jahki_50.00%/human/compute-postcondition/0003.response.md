The function `min_operations_to_increase_median` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of elements in the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an input `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, the function calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It returns the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the list `a`. The function handles multiple test cases, each defined by an input `t`.**
