### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`num2`) and the array itself (`case`).

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The function has a special condition to handle cases where `num2` is greater than 10000. It prints `1` and `16668` and breaks out of the loop. However, this condition seems arbitrary and does not align with the problem statement. The problem does not specify any special behavior for large `num2` values, and the output `16668` is not explained. This is a potential issue.

3. **Array Parsing:**
   - The function correctly parses the input string `case` into a list of integers `a`.

4. **Sorting and Median Calculation:**
   - The function sorts the list `a` to create `b`.
   - It correctly calculates the index `ma` of the median element based on whether `num2` is even or odd.

5. **Median Increase Logic:**
   - The function initializes `median` to the current median value in the sorted list `b`.
   - It then enters a loop to increment the median element until it is greater than the current median.
   - The loop increments the element at index `ma` and sorts the list again, which is inefficient but correct for the purpose of finding the new median.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the number of operations required to increase the median for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Arbitrary Edge Case:**
  - The condition `if num2 > 10000` and the subsequent print statements are not aligned with the problem statement. This is a significant issue that can lead to incorrect results for valid inputs.
- **Inefficiency:**
  - The loop that increments the median element and sorts the list on each iteration is inefficient. However, it does not affect the correctness of the solution, just the performance.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the arbitrary edge case, the program is incorrect. The condition `if num2 > 10000` and the subsequent print statements should be removed to align with the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**False**
