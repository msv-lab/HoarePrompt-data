Output State: **The loop iterates `num` times, processing each test case. For each test case, it reads an integer `num2` and a space-separated list of integers `case`. If `num2` is greater than 10000, it prints `1` and `16668` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the list `a` and prints this number. The variables `num2`, `case`, `op`, `a`, `b`, `ma`, `median`, and `new_median` are updated within the loop for each test case, but their final values after the loop depends on the last test case processed. The variable `num` remains unchanged.**
