### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array itself as a string `case`.
   - It then parses the array `case` into a list of integers `a`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function includes a condition to check if `num2` (the length of the array) is greater than 10000. If it is, it prints `1` and `16668` and breaks out of the loop. This is incorrect because the problem guarantees that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`, and there is no specific reason to handle arrays of length greater than 10000 differently.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The function sorts the array `a` and calculates the index `ma` for the median.
   - If `num2` is even, the median is the element at index `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.
   - If `num2` is odd, the median is the element at index `int(num2 / 2)`.

4. **Increasing the Median**:
   - The function initializes `median` with the current median value.
   - It then enters a loop where it increments the element at index `ma` by 1 and increases the operation count `op` by 1.
   - After each increment, it sorts the array again and checks if the new median is greater than the original median.
   - This loop continues until the new median is greater than the original median.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the number of operations required to increase the median.

### Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling**: The condition `if num2 > 10000` is incorrect and unnecessary. It should be removed.
- **Efficiency**: Sorting the array in each iteration of the loop is inefficient. Instead, we can directly increment the median element and count the operations needed to make it greater than the next element in the sorted array.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(num):
        num2 = int(input())
        case = input()
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            next_median = b[ma + 1]
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
            next_median = b[ma + 1] if ma + 1 < num2 else b[ma] + 1
        
        median = b[ma]
        op = 0
        while median <= next_median:
            median += 1
            op += 1
        
        print(op)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Parsing**: The same as the original program.
- **Median Calculation**: The same as the original program.
- **Increasing the Median**: Instead of sorting the array in each iteration, we directly increment the median element and count the operations needed to make it greater than the next element in the sorted array.
- **Output**: The same as the original program.

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the unnecessary edge case handling and inefficiency in the loop.
- The corrected program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **False**
