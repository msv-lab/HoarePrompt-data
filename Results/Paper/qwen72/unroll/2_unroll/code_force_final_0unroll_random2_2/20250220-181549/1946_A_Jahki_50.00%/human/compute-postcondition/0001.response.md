To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`. The loop will execute if `num` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as specified in the loop statement `for i in range(0, num)`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_operations_to_increase_median(n, a):` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, each defined by the input `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `num` is an input integer.

To ensure the loop executes, `num` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
