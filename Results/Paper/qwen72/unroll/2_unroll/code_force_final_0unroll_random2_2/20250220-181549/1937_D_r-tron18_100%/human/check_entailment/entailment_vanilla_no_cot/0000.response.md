Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - This function calculates the difference between the last element of an array and the element at a specific position, adjusted for the length of the array. It is used to compute the necessary indices for the pinball movement.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in the string.
     - `preOne` is the prefix sum of the indices in `pre`, with an initial value of 0.
     - `suffZero` is a list that will store the suffix sums of the indices where the character is '<'.
     - `ans` is a list to store the results for each cell.

   - **Main Loop**:
     - The loop iterates from the last cell to the first cell.
     - For each cell, it checks if the character is '>' or '<'.
     - If the character is '>', it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the `func_1` function and the `preOne` and `suffZero` lists.
     - If the character is '<', it updates the `suffZero` list and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the `func_1` function and the `preOne` and `suffZero` lists.
     - The results are stored in the `ans` list.

3. **Output**:
   - The results for each cell are printed in the required format.

The program correctly handles the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the characters, ensuring that the pinball will always leave the grid within a finite number of steps. The use of prefix and suffix sums helps in efficiently calculating the time for each cell, which is crucial for handling large inputs within the given constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.
