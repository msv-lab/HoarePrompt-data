Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` integers. For each test case, it identifies the number of elements in `l` that are greater than both the first element of `l` and a subsequent element found to be greater than its predecessor. The function prints this count for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `y` are reset for each test case, and the function does not return any value. The final state of these variables is undefined after the function concludes, but the output consists of the printed values of `c` for each test case. **
