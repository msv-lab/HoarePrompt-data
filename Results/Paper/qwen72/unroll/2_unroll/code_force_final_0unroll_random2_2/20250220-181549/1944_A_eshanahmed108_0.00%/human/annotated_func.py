#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_islands(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The function `min_islands` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The loop has executed all iterations, and for each iteration, it has printed `n` if `n - k <= 1`, otherwise it has printed `1`. The values of `n` and `k` for each iteration are determined by the user input, and these values are not retained after the loop. The loop itself does not modify the function definition.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple pairs of integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `n` represents the number of islands and `k` represents the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed. For each pair, it prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it prints `1`. The function does not return any value and does not retain the input values after each iteration.
