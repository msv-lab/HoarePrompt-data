Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the binary string has multiple consecutive '1's followed by '0's. For example, for the input "1100", the program will output 3, but the correct output should be 2. The program increments the count every time it encounters a change in characters, but it does not consider that a sorted binary string can be formed by fewer pieces if there are consecutive '1's followed by '0's.
