The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. The parameter `n` represents the length of the string to be formed, and `k` represents the number of the first lowercase English alphabets to be used. The function returns a string that is composed of the first `k` characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' repeated `n` times.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26) and returns a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times.**
