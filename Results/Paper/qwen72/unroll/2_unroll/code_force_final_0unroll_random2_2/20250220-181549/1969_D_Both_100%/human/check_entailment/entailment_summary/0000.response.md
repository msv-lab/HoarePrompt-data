### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_2` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, which is used to read the values of `n` and `k`, as well as the lists of prices `a_i` and `b_i`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `func_4` handles each test case by:
     - Reading `n` and `k` using `func_2`.
     - Reading the prices `a_i` and `b_i` using `func_2`.
     - Creating a list of tuples `combined` where each tuple is `(-a_i, b_i)`. This is done to facilitate the use of a min-heap (since Python's `heapq` is a min-heap by default) to manage the items with the highest `b_i` values.
     - Sorting `combined` by the second element (Bob's price) in ascending order. This ensures that Bob will take the items with the lowest `b_i` values for free, minimizing Alice's profit.
     - Pushing the first `k` items from `combined` into a heap. This heap will store the items that Bob will take for free.
     - Calculating the initial profit using `func_3` with the remaining items and the heap.
     - Iteratively considering the remaining items to see if they can increase the profit:
       - If the combined price `(-a_i + b_i)` is non-negative, it adds to the current profit.
       - If the combined price is negative, it subtracts from the current profit.
       - It then pushes the current item into the heap and pops the smallest item from the heap, adjusting the current profit accordingly.
     - The maximum profit is updated and printed for each test case.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice's goal is to maximize her profit, which is the sum of Bob's payments minus the sum of Alice's expenses.
   - Bob's goal is to minimize Alice's profit by taking the `k` items with the lowest `b_i` values for free.
   - The sorting and heap operations ensure that Bob takes the items with the lowest `b_i` values, and Alice's profit is calculated by considering the remaining items and their combined prices.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles cases where `k` is 0 (Bob takes no items for free) and where `k` is equal to `n` (Bob takes all items for free).
   - The function also handles cases where `n` is small or large, ensuring that the heap operations and sorting are efficient.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions, when used together, correctly implement the logic to determine Alice's maximum profit given the constraints and the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob. The program reads the input correctly, processes each test case as described, and prints the correct output for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
