Functionality: ** The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It performs a series of operations to determine and print the maximum profit that can be achieved for each of `test_cases` test cases. Each test case involves selecting `k` items from a list of `n` items, where each item has a price and a bonus. The function initializes and manipulates internal variables such as `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined` within each test case. After processing each test case, the final `max_profit` is printed, and the internal variables are reset for the next test case. The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
