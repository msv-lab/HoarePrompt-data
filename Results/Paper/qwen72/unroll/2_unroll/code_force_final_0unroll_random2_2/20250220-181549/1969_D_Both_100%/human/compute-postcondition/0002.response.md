Output State: **The loop iterates `test_cases` times, and after each iteration, the variables `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined` are reset to their initial values within the loop. Therefore, after all iterations, these variables will not retain any specific final state from the last iteration, but the `max_profit` for each test case will be printed. The variables `test_cases` and any other variables not mentioned in the loop head and body remain unchanged.**
