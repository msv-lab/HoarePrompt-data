The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is given (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the provided array.**
