### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make up to \( 3n \) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.
   - The queries are of the form \( ? \ a \ b \ c \ d \), and the response is either \( < \), \( = \), or \( > \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and initializes \( mak \) to 0.
   - It then iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) to find the index \( mak \) such that \( p_{mak} \) is the maximum value in the permutation \( p \) based on the bitwise OR comparison \( (p_{mak} \mid p_{mak}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_i) \).
   - After finding \( mak \), it initializes \( mak2 \) to \( mak \) and creates an empty list \( pans \).
   - It then iterates over all indices \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \) to find indices that are equal to \( mak2 \) based on the bitwise OR comparison \( (p_{mak} \mid p_{mak2}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_{mak2}) \).
   - It updates \( mak \) to the index \( i \) if \( (p_i \mid p_{mak2}) \) is less than \( (p_{mak} \mid p_{mak2}) \), and appends \( i \) to \( pans \) if they are equal.
   - Finally, it iterates over the indices in \( pans \) to find the index \( mak \) such that \( p_{pans[mak]} \) is the maximum value among the equal indices based on the bitwise OR comparison \( (p_{pans[mak]} \mid p_{pans[mak]}) \) with \( (p_{pans[i]} \mid p_{pans[i]}) \).
   - It prints the indices \( mak2 \) and \( pans[mak] \) as the answer.

3. **Query Count**:
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The second loop makes \( n \) queries.
   - The third loop makes at most \( n-1 \) queries.
   - Total queries: \( (n-1) + n + (n-1) = 3n - 2 \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum value \( p_{mak} \) in the permutation.
   - It then identifies all indices that are equal to \( mak2 \) based on the bitwise OR comparison.
   - Finally, it correctly identifies the maximum value among the equal indices.
   - The program ensures that the number of queries does not exceed \( 3n \).

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and adheres to the constraints of the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
