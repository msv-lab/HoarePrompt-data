### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, using at most \( 3n \) queries.
   - Each query involves comparing \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) with \( (p_c \mid p_d) \) using the bitwise OR operation.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and initializes `mak` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range \( 1 \) to \( n-1 \) to find the index `mak` such that \( p_{mak} \) is the maximum value in the permutation. This is done by comparing \( (p_{mak} \mid p_{mak}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_i) \) for each \( i \) in the range.
   - After finding `mak`, it initializes `mak2` to `mak` and creates an empty list `pans`.
   - It then iterates over the range \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) to find indices that are equal to `mak2` and updates `pans` accordingly.
   - Finally, it iterates over `pans` to find the maximum value among the elements that are equal to `mak2` and prints the result.

3. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The second loop makes \( n \) queries.
   - The third loop makes at most \( n-1 \) queries.
   - Total queries: \( (n-1) + n + (n-1) = 3n - 2 \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The first loop correctly identifies the index `mak` such that \( p_{mak} \) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - The second loop correctly identifies all indices that are equal to `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`).
   - The third loop correctly identifies the maximum value among the elements that are equal to `mak2`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem's requirements and constraints. It uses the allowed number of queries and correctly identifies the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
