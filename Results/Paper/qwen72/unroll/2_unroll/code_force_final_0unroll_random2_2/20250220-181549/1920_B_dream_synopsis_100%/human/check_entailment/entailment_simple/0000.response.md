### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It then reads the array `a` using `list(map(int, input().split()))`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order using `a.sort()`.
   - It is then reversed using `a.reverse()`, which effectively sorts the array in descending order. This is done to ensure that Alice can remove the largest elements first, which is optimal for maximizing the sum.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum of the array `sum1` is calculated using `sum(a)`.

4. **Optimal Strategy Calculation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the possible sums after Alice and Bob's moves.
   - It iterates through the possible number of elements Alice can remove, from 0 to `k` (inclusive).
   - For each `i` (number of elements Alice removes):
     - If `i` is 0, it calculates the sum after Bob multiplies the first `x` elements by -1. This is done by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements from `sum1` and appending the result to `ans`.
     - If `i` is greater than 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, it updates the sum by adding the element that Alice removed and subtracting twice the element that Bob will multiply by -1. This is done to account for the changes in the sum after Alice's and Bob's moves.
     - If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, it only adds the element that Alice removed to the sum, as Bob cannot multiply any more elements by -1.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the maximum value from the list `ans` for each test case, which represents the optimal sum after both players have made their moves.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Alice's Strategy:**
  - Alice should remove the largest elements to maximize the sum. This is achieved by sorting the array in descending order and considering the removal of the first `i` elements.
- **Bob's Strategy:**
  - Bob should multiply the smallest elements by -1 to minimize the sum. This is achieved by considering the first `x` elements in the sorted array (which are the smallest after reversing).

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The logic seems to handle edge cases correctly, such as when `k` or `x` are 0 or when `n` is small.
- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient enough given the constraints, as it sorts the array once per test case and then iterates through it a few times.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob and handles the given constraints and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
