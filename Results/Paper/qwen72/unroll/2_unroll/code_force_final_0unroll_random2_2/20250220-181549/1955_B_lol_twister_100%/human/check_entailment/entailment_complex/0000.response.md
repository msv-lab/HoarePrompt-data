### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Minimum Value Calculation**: The program finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`. This is the correct approach because the smallest element in the progressive square will be `a_{1,1}`.

3. **Progressive Square Generation**: The program generates a list `li` of `n^2` elements, where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. This correctly simulates the construction of the progressive square based on the given rules.

4. **Sorting and Comparison**: The program sorts both the input list `l` and the generated list `li` and then compares them. If they are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that the elements in `l` can form the progressive square. If they are not equal, it returns 'no'.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the result of `func_1` for each test case, which is either 'yes' or 'no'.

### Issues:
- **Case Sensitivity**: The problem statement mentions that the output can be in any case (e.g., 'YES', 'yes', 'Yes'). However, the program only returns 'yes' and 'no'. This is a minor issue, but it should be fixed to ensure the output matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct, but it should return 'YES' and 'NO' instead of 'yes' and 'no' to match the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the issue, you can modify the return statements in `func_1` to return 'YES' and 'NO' instead of 'yes' and 'no':

```python
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

With this fix, the program will be correct.
