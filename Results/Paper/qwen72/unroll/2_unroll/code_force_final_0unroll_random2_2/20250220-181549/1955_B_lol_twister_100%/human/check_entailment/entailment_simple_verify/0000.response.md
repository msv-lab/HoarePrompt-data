Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program indeed does not handle the case where the input array `l` contains duplicate elements. According to the problem description, the elements of the progressive square should be unique. The program constructs the list `li` based on the smallest element `a` and the rules for generating the elements of the progressive square. It then sorts both `l` and `li` and checks if they are equal. If `l` contains duplicates, the sorted `l` will still be equal to the sorted `li` (which contains unique elements), leading to an incorrect "yes" output.

The failing case provided in the original assessment is a valid example:
```
Input:
1
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 6 4 8

Output:
yes

Expected Output:
no
```
Here, the input array `l` contains the number `6` twice, which means it is impossible to form a progressive square with unique elements. However, the program incorrectly returns "yes".

To fix this, the program should check for duplicates in the input array `l` before constructing and comparing the lists. If duplicates are found, the program should immediately return "no".

Final: **False**
