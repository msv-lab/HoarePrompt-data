Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list of integers `l`. This part of the program is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Finding the Minimum Element**: The program finds the minimum element `a` in the list `l`. This is correct because the minimum element in the list should correspond to `a_{1,1}` in the progressive square. The annotation confirms that `a` is indeed the smallest integer in the list `l`.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The program generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` in the range `[0, n-1]`. This is correct because it follows the rules of the progressive square construction. The annotation confirms that `li` is a list of `n^2` integers where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`.

4. **Sorting and Comparison**: The program sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l`. It then compares the two sorted lists. If they are equal, it returns "yes"; otherwise, it returns "no". This is correct because the elements of the progressive square should match the elements in the input list `l` when sorted. The annotation confirms that both lists are sorted and compared correctly.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, which is the correct way to output the results. However, the original assessment correctly points out that the output format should be "YES" or "NO" (case-insensitive), but the program returns "yes" or "no". This is a minor issue that could cause the program to fail if the judge is case-sensitive.

6. **Correction**: The suggested correction to change the return values to "YES" and "NO" is appropriate and necessary to ensure that the program meets the output format requirements specified in the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the case sensitivity issue. However, the program's logic and functionality are correct. After making the suggested correction, the program will meet all the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **False** (before the correction)
Final: **True** (after the correction)
