You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a grid as input, where the grid is a list of strings, each string representing a row of the grid and consisting of characters '0' or '1'. The grid is of size n x n, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0

        else:

    #State: The grid remains unchanged, and the loop prints either 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' for each iteration based on the input grid.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the grid size `n` and the grid itself.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The program uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to track whether a triangle or a square is detected.
   - For each row `s` in the grid, it counts the number of '1's in the row using `s.count('1')`.
   - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'. This is based on the assumption that a triangle will have rows with a single '1' at some point, which is correct for the given problem description.
   - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'. This is based on the assumption that a square will have rows with more than one '1', which is also correct for the given problem description.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is not zero (i.e., it has been set to 'TRIANGLE'), the program prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where a triangle has more than one '1' in a row. For example, a triangle with `k=3` will have rows with 1, 3, and 5 '1's. The program will incorrectly set `b` to 'SQUARE' when it encounters a row with 3 or 5 '1's.
   - The program does not check the shape's consistency across all rows. For example, it does not verify if the '1's form a perfect triangle or square.
   - The program does not handle the case where the shape is an upside-down triangle correctly. It only checks for rows with a single '1', which might not be sufficient for detecting an upside-down triangle.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect because it does not properly differentiate between triangles and squares, especially in cases where a triangle has more than one '1' in a row.
   - The program also lacks the necessary checks to ensure the shape is consistent across all rows.
