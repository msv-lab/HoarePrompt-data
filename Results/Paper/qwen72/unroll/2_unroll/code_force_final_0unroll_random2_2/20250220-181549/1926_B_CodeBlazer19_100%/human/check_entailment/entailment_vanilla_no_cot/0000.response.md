Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly determine the shape based on the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Shape Detection:**
   - The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to identify a triangle. A triangle can have rows with more than one '1', and the number of '1's in each row should follow the pattern of a triangle (i.e., 1, 3, 5, etc.).
   - The program checks if a row contains more than one '1' to determine if the shape is a square. This is also not sufficient because a square has a specific pattern where each row contains the same number of '1's, and they are aligned in a square shape.

2. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The variable `a` is used to store the string 'TRIANGLE' if any row has exactly one '1'. This is not a correct way to determine the shape of the entire grid.
   - The variable `b` is used to store the string 'SQUARE' if any row has more than one '1'. This is also not a correct way to determine the shape of the entire grid.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the shape is an upside-down triangle or a square of a specific size.

3. **Output Issues:**
   - The program prints 'TRIANGLE' if any row has exactly one '1', which is incorrect because a triangle can have multiple rows with more than one '1'.
   - The program prints 'SQUARE' if no row has exactly one '1', which is also incorrect because a triangle can have multiple rows with more than one '1'.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. Identify the pattern of '1's in the grid to determine if they form a triangle or a square.
2. Check for the specific conditions that define a triangle and a square as described in the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(grid, n):
    # Check for a normal triangle
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        for r in range(n - k + 1):
            for c in range(k):
                if all(grid[r + i][c + k - 1 - i] == '1' for i in range(k)) and all(grid[r + i][c + k - 1 - i + j] == '0' for i in range(k) for j in range(1, n - (c + k - 1 - i))):
                    return True
    # Check for an upside-down triangle
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        for r in range(k - 1, n):
            for c in range(k):
                if all(grid[r - i][c + k - 1 - i] == '1' for i in range(k)) and all(grid[r - i][c + k - 1 - i + j] == '0' for i in range(k) for j in range(1, n - (c + k - 1 - i))):
                    return True
    return False

def is_square(grid, n):
    # Check for a square
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        for r in range(n - k + 1):
            for c in range(n - k + 1):
                if all(grid[r + i][c + j] == '1' for i in range(k) for j in range(k)) and all(grid[r + i][c + j] == '0' for i in range(k) for j in range(n) if j < c or j >= c + k):
                    return True
    return False

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        if is_triangle(grid, n):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        elif is_square(grid, n):
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            print("ERROR")  # This should not happen as the problem guarantees one shape

func()
```

This corrected version checks for the specific patterns of a triangle and a square and correctly identifies the shape based on the problem description.
