The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each tuple, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` and `y` are integers (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), and `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of integers `results` where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for each test case in `test_cases`. The length of `results` is equal to `t`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function returns a list of integers `results` where each integer is the count of beautiful pairs for each test case. The length of `results` is equal to `t`.**
