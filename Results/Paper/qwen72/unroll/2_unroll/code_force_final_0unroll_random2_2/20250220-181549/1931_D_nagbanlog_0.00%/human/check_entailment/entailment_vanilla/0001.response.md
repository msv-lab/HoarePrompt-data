### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find pairs of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and the following conditions are met:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The given program uses a frequency dictionary to count the number of elements that satisfy the conditions for being a beautiful pair.
   - For each element \(a_i\) in the array:
     - It calculates \(a_i \mod x\) and \(a_i \mod y\).
     - It determines the required modulo values for \(a_j\) such that the pair \(\langle a_i, a_j \rangle\) is beautiful:
       - \(a_j \mod x\) should be \((x - a_i \mod x) \mod x\).
       - \(a_j \mod y\) should be \(a_i \mod y\).
     - It checks if the required modulo values are already in the frequency dictionary. If they are, it adds the count of such values to the beautiful pairs count.
     - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current modulo values.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `results` list to store the results for each test case.
     - For each test case, initialize `freq` dictionary to keep track of the frequency of modulo pairs.
     - Initialize `beautiful_count` to 0 to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - **Processing Each Element**:
     - For each element `num` in the array `a`:
       - Calculate `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
       - Calculate the required modulo values for \(a_j\) to form a beautiful pair with `num`:
         - `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` ensures that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
         - `required_mod_y = mod_y` ensures that \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
       - If the required modulo pair \((required_mod_x, required_mod_y)\) is in the `freq` dictionary, add the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
       - Update the `freq` dictionary with the current modulo pair \((mod_x, mod_y)\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating over `test_cases`.
   - It correctly initializes the `freq` dictionary for each test case.
   - The modulo operations and required modulo calculations are performed correctly.

5. **Output**:
   - The program appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case.
- The modulo calculations and frequency dictionary usage are appropriate for the problem.
- The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
