Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains a dictionary with keys 'params' and 'array', where 'params' is a tuple of three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and 'array' is a list of `n` integers. The function processes each test case to count the number of "beautiful pairs" in the list `a`. A "beautiful pair" is defined as a pair of numbers in `a` where the first number can be incremented by some integer to make it divisible by `x` and the second number is already divisible by `y`. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case. **
