### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries, each containing the parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`).
   - The function iterates over each test case and extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`.

2. **Frequency Dictionary:**
   - A dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` where `mod_x` is the remainder of `num % x` and `mod_y` is the remainder of `num % y`.

3. **Beautiful Pair Calculation:**
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, the program calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - It then calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` such that:
     - `required_mod_x` is the remainder that, when added to `mod_x`, results in a number divisible by `x`.
     - `required_mod_y` is the same as `mod_y` because the difference `a_i - a_j` should be divisible by `y`.
   - The program checks if the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the `freq` dictionary. If it does, it adds the frequency of this pair to `beautiful_count`.
   - The program updates the frequency of the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all numbers in the array `a` for a test case, the function appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.
   - The function returns the `results` list, which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correct Calculation of `required_mod_x`:**
  - The calculation `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` is correct because it finds the remainder that, when added to `mod_x`, results in a number divisible by `x`.
  - For example, if `num % x = 2` and `x = 5`, then `required_mod_x = (5 - 2) % 5 = 3`.

- **Correct Calculation of `required_mod_y`:**
  - The calculation `required_mod_y = mod_y` is correct because the difference `a_i - a_j` should be divisible by `y`, and `mod_y` is the remainder of `num % y`.

- **Frequency Dictionary Usage:**
  - The `freq` dictionary is used to count how many times a particular pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` has been seen.
  - When checking if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`, the program correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs.

- **Resetting `freq` and `beautiful_count`:**
  - The `freq` dictionary and `beautiful_count` are reset for each test case, ensuring that the counts are accurate for each individual test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. The use of the `freq` dictionary and the calculations for `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` are accurate and consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
