It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. The function described in the problem is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`, but the function definition given is `def func():`. I will correct this and provide the precondition based on the problem description.

Function definition:
```
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that 0 <= start <= end, and the current directory contains subfolders with names that can be converted to integers within the range [start, end], and each of these subfolders may contain .html files.**
