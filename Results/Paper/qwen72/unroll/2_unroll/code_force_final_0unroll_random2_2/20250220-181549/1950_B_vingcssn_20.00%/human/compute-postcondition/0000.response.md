Output State: **The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) representing the number of test cases, and each of the following `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the size of the checkerboard to be generated. `casos` is an integer equal to `t`.**
