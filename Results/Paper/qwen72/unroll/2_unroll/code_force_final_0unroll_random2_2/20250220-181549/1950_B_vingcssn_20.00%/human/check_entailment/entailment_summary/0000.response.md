Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by generating a checkerboard pattern for specific values of `n` (1 to 4). However, the problem description clearly states that `n` can be any integer from 1 to 20, and the program should generate the checkerboard pattern for any valid `n` within this range. The current implementation only handles `n` values of 1, 2, 3, and 4, and fails to generate the correct pattern for any other value of `n` within the specified range (1 to 20). For values of `n` outside this range, it prints an error message, which is not what the problem requires.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
