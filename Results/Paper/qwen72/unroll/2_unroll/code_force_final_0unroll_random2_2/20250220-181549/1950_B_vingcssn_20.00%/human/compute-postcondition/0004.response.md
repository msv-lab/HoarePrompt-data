Functionality: ** The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 20`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the size of a checkerboard to be generated. The function then prints a specific checkerboard pattern to the console based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints a 2x2 checkerboard. If `n` is 2, it prints a 4x4 checkerboard. If `n` is 3, it prints a 6x6 checkerboard. If `n` is 4, it prints an 8x8 checkerboard. If `n` is outside the range of 1 to 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the variable `casos` remains equal to `t`. The function does not return any value. **
