Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Limited Range Handling**: The program only handles specific values of `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4) explicitly. For any other value of `n` within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), it prints "No esta en el rango" which is not the expected output.

2. **General Solution Missing**: The problem description requires a general solution that works for any valid `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The program does not provide a general solution and instead uses hard-coded outputs for specific values of `n`.

3. **Output Format**: The program does not ensure that the output is a 2n × 2n checkerboard for any `n` in the valid range. It only prints the correct output for `n` = 1, 2, 3, and 4, and fails to handle other cases.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should generate the checkerboard dynamically based on the value of `n`. Here is a correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for _ in range(casos):
        n = int(input())
        board = [['.' for _ in range(2 * n)] for _ in range(2 * n)]
        
        for i in range(2 * n):
            for j in range(2 * n):
                if (i // 2 + j // 2) % 2 == 0:
                    board[i][j] = '#'
        
        for row in board:
            print(''.join(row))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This code dynamically generates the checkerboard for any valid `n` and ensures the correct output format.
