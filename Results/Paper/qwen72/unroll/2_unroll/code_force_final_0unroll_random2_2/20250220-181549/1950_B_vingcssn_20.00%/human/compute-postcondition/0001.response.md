To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `c` and `casos`. The loop will execute if `casos` is greater than 0, and `c` starts at 0. The state of `func` and the input it reads from stdin does not directly affect the loop head, so we do not need to adjust those.

Given that `casos` is an integer equal to `t`, and `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 20), we need to ensure that `casos` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`c` is 0, `casos` must be greater than 0**
