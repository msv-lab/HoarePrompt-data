### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Non-Decreasing Order:**
   - The function first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function. If it is, the function prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.
   - This part of the logic is correct and handles the straightforward case where the array is already sorted.

2. **Handling Non-Sorted Arrays:**
   - If the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order, the function then attempts to find a split point `i` where the array can be divided into two parts `x` and `y` such that:
     - `x = a[:i]` and `y = a[i:]`
     - After swapping `x` and `y` to form `y + x`, the resulting array should be non-decreasing.
   - The function checks this by:
     - Ensuring that the maximum element of the first part `a[:i]` is less than or equal to the minimum element of the second part `a[i:]`.
     - Ensuring that the second part `a[i:]` is non-decreasing.

3. **Logical Flaw in the Code:**
   - The function has a logical flaw in the way it checks if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. Specifically, the condition `check_all_new` is checking if the first element of the original array `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in the new array `new`. This is incorrect because:
     - The first element of the original array `a[0]` should be compared with the last element of the new array `new[-1]` to ensure the split is valid.
     - Additionally, the function should check if the entire array `new + a[:i]` is non-decreasing, not just `new`.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach would be to:
     - Find the first index `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`.
     - Check if the subarray `a[i:]` is non-decreasing.
     - Check if the subarray `a[:i]` is non-increasing.
     - Ensure that the last element of `a[:i]` is less than or equal to the first element of `a[i:]`.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `1 1 4 5 1 4`, the function will find that the array is not non-decreasing at the first split point `i=4` (where `a[3] > a[4]`). It will then incorrectly check if `1` is greater than or equal to all elements in `a[4:]`, which is not the correct condition.
   - For the input `7 9 2 2 3`, the function will find the split point `i=2` (where `a[1] > a[2]`). It will then correctly check if `9` is greater than or equal to all elements in `a[2:]` and if `a[2:]` is non-decreasing, but it should also check if `a[:2]` is non-increasing.

### Conclusion:
The function has a logical flaw in the way it checks if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
