You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it internally processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array a, and a list of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array a. The number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])

                        break
                    else:

    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. The variable `t` is now 0, as it has been decremented by the loop. The variables `n` and `a` are not defined outside the loop and are reset with each iteration based on the input. The variables `check_all`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` are also reset with each iteration and do not persist outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function checks if the list is non-decreasing. If it is, it prints 'YES'. If not, it checks if the list can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes and no variables persist outside the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - The program checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints "YES" and moves to the next test case.

3. **Finding the First Unsorted Element:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.

4. **Split and Swap Check:**
   - The program then splits the array into two parts: `a[0:i]` and `a[i:]`.
   - It checks if the new array `new` (which is `a[i:] + a[0:i]`) is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It also checks if the first element of the original array `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in the new array `new`.

5. **Output:**
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES".
   - If not, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies if the array is already sorted.
- The logic for splitting and swapping the array is flawed. Specifically, the program only checks the first unsorted element and performs a single split and swap. However, the problem allows for multiple operations, and the program should check all possible splits and swaps to determine if the array can be sorted.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible splits and swaps. It only checks the first unsorted element and performs a single operation, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after multiple operations.

### Correctness: **False**
