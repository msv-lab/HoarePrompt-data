The function `func` is designed to be called with no arguments. However, it internally processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of an array `a`, and a list of `n` positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array `a`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

The function returns the results of processing these test cases, but the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to internally handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, and return the results of processing these test cases.

Functionality: **The function `func` accepts no arguments but internally processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function returns the results of processing these test cases.**
