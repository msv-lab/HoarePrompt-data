### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - The program checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints "YES" and moves to the next test case.

3. **Finding the First Unsorted Element:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.

4. **Split and Swap Check:**
   - The program then splits the array into two parts: `a[0:i]` and `a[i:]`.
   - It checks if the new array `new` (which is `a[i:] + a[0:i]`) is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It also checks if the first element of the original array `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in the new array `new`.

5. **Output:**
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES".
   - If not, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies if the array is already sorted.
- The logic for splitting and swapping the array is flawed. Specifically, the program only checks the first unsorted element and performs a single split and swap. However, the problem allows for multiple operations, and the program should check all possible splits and swaps to determine if the array can be sorted.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible splits and swaps. It only checks the first unsorted element and performs a single operation, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after multiple operations.

### Correctness: **False**
