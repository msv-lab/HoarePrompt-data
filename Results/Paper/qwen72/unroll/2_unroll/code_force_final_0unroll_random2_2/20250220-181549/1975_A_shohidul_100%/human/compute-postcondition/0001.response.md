The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it will take on values from the range of `t`.

Given that `t` is now assigned the value of an input integer, and the input integer must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 for the function to process test cases, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment**
