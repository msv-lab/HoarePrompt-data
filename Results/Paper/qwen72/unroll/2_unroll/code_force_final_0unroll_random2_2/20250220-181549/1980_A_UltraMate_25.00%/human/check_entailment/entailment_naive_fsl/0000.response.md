Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the character 'G' in the string, which is part of the required difficulty levels for each round. The string `p` in the program only includes 'ABCDEF', missing 'G'. This means if the input string `s` does not contain 'G', the program will not correctly account for the need to create problems of difficulty 'G'. For example, for the input `10 1\nBGECDCBDED`, the program will output `2` instead of `3` because it does not check for the presence of 'G'.
